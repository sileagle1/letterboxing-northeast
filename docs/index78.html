                        Does anyone out there have geocache connections? I would like to discuss our Island Sanctuary LB with Walden Run.

                        I checked a few mystery box clues for Maine.  One seemed to be in

                        Be sure to check out the clues for Warcat 76's Personal Travelers if 
you're planning to attend the gathering on Oct. 1st.  They can be 
found under NJ mystery on the lbna site.
