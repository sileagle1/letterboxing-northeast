                        Yesterday I planted 14 letterboxes! Woohoo! That is a record for me by far! :) 

12 of them are the TV Land Series. And they are all in Sharon, MA. 

If you are in the neighborhood...pop by and let...

                        Sorry for the accidental post to this list, which I intended as a

We'll be heading to the Lake Ossippee Area of NH in the near future and are looking for a few easy boxes to find in the area. Any suggestions?
