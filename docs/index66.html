                        Just a little update. I have decided to forego the stamp carving 
tutorial/demo as I am concerned about giving people enough time to 
box and enjoy Highland Forest. Winter boxing takes a little more...

                        Krab King lost his stamp! He believes it was at the 'Exit 5, Happy

his pocket. If any one locates this item, please contact...
