                        sorry - I meant to e-mail Donutz off line, but must have accidently 
hit "reply" to her post so it showed up here...I deleted it, but some

                        I'll be traveling to VT in a few weeks and was wondering if there are any boxes at the rest areas off Interstate 91?  I did a search, but couldn't find anything.  Help is appreciated!

  Enjoy!
