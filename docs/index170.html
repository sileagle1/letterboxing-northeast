                        Hello all,

This is kinda neat since I believe I've met everyone who's posted so 
far (except Ryan) in person! Hopefully, the fact that we all live so 
close (and some know where others live!) will...

                        I feel like a kid who has found a hidden treehouse in the forest, or 
a, a, a LETTERBOX! I think we should cook up something different to 
launch this site over the weekend. Something along the lines...

                        Thank you Brian for taking initiative and Ryan for breaking the ice.
As a significant amount of letterboxes (ers) are concentrated in the
New England area, IMHO I think this is a good step forward....

                        Great to see we have our own little talk site. Well done Brian and 
team! Ok, I am en route to NY for the weekend, if this snow storm 
turns out to what it's cracked up to be, it looks like there...
