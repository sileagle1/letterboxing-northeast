letterboxing near the end of their 10 O'clock news tomorrow night. The Haley
Family from Pembroke, MA and I were interviewed for the...

                        So, how many of you were affected by the torrential rains and winds
that blew through Massachusetts on Friday?  The storm felled a lot of
trees near me in Bellingham.  I wonder how many letterboxes...

                        What a weird story!!!  I really hope that you do find your stamp but it certainly does make for a good story to tell about your letterboxing journeys.

                        Today I took my sister, from MT, out letterboxing. We decided that we would

                        Hello All!

Unfortunately, this box has gone missing.  I will be temporarily 
replacing the box with the stamp I originally carved for this box (same 
logo) in the next week or so.  I will eventually...
