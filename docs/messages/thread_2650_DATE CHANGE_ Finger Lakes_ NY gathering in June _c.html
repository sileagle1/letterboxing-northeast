week and will now be held on June 17th. I apologize for the switch, <br/>
especially if the new date won't work for people who had been planning to <br/>
come. The park wouldn't take reservations for 2006 until this week so there <br/>
was no way of knowing when the picnic pavilion we needed would be free for <br/>
rental until now.<br/>
<br/>
I've updated the event listing on Atlas Quest with information that may be <br/>
useful for anyone who wasn't in attendance last year.<br/>

Hope to see some of you here in June!<br/>
