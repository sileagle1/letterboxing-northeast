I brought Nanny Bell of Ct with me to the gathering. She and I and I <br/>
am sure others were blown away with your gathering stamp. This is why <br/>
I haven't picked up the craving knife yet! Could you give us some <br/>
hints as to how you get those fine line so straight and sharp? It was <br/>
flawless. She was saying that it's as good as when you mail away a <br/>
picture and get it back as a stamp. Hints please without giving away <br/>
too many of your secrets!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2096737044">Hi DragonLady and NannyBell, <br/>
<br/>
 Truth is, there is no real secret, I don't believe I'm doing <br/>
anything different than anybody else who is carving. I use a #11 X-<br/>
Acto knife under a lighted magnifying glass. <br/>
  I think the quality of your initial image transfer can make a big <br/>
difference in the final outcome of your stamp. I started with the <br/>
acetone (nail polish) transfer process, but found this to be a bit <br/>
messy. Sometimes the paper would leave particles stuck to the carving <br/>
material and also the edges of the image would tend to blur from the <br/>
edge of my hand rubbing repeatedly along it. Anybody who has seen my <br/>
Strix Varia stamp should know that the image for that was originally <br/>
much larger, but after carving out the middle section I had pretty <br/>
much rendered the outer portions unusable. I ended up cutting these <br/>
sections away resulting in the image as it is now. After <br/>
experimenting with the heat transfer method (iron) I have had much <br/>
better results with the transferring of images. I have found that a <br/>
very crisp bold image can be obtained. Like I said this may take some <br/>
experimentation on your part. I found that a low heat over longer <br/>
time worked better for me, although I've spoke with others who found <br/>
a quick blast of high heat works  wonders for them. This may have <br/>
something to do with the toner being used in the particular copier <br/>
being used. You want to find an older model that uses heat to bind <br/>
the toner to the paper. Libraries and drug stores often have these <br/>
older models. I myself am going to keep my eyes open come yard sale <br/>
season, I hope to be able to pick one up at a reasonable price to <br/>
have at home. <br/>
 After obtaining a good image to start with, it becomes a matter of <br/>
how much time are you willing to commit to the stamp. Something I <br/>
know is going into the wild I tend to pick a somewhat simpler, easier <br/>
to carve image than one I know will be safe, such as an event stamp <br/>
or a personal traveler ( that's if I had a personal traveler) or, am <br/>
I'm not sure why this is, but a stamp I was giving to someone else to <br/>
hide. I tend to carve in short spurts over a long period of time. <br/>
About an hour and a half to two hours, with breaks as I feel I need <br/>
them, is all I'm good for before my eyes are shot. Once I realize I'm <br/>
having difficulty with my eyes or keeping my hand steady I will put <br/>
things away for the night (yeah right, Lori wishes this were the <br/>
case, actually every thing is left all over the kitchen table) and <br/>
pick up were I left off when I have the time and the inclination to <br/>
do so. <br/>
 I've also found that throwing the stamp in the fridge to cool it <br/>
down a bit will make it harder. This makes smaller areas that need to <br/>
come out easier to deal with as the knife is more likely to cut thru <br/>
the material rather than kind of tear thru. The Poe stamp had many <br/>
such areas and spent a good deal of time sitting next to the <br/>
margarine in our fridge. You don't want to freeze it, just get it <br/>
cold. <br/>
 Also I tend to be a bit obsessive about things and am constantly <br/>
thinking about the particular stamp I am working on. I will make <br/>
copies of the original artwork and keep one pinned to my bulletin <br/>
board here at work and can't walk through my kitchen without picking <br/>
the stamp up and looking at it, planning were my next knife cuts will <br/>
be. <br/>
 I hope this long winded answer will help out. Any other specific <br/>
questions you may have, just email me and I will do my best to answer <br/>
them. There are also many sources on the web you should read, Silent <br/>
Doug, Ryan C., and Mitch "Der Mad Stamper", all have excellent <br/>
tutorials that will give a basic know how of stamp carving. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for you comments! <br/>

Just wanted to insert a completely worthwhile plug here...<br/>
<br/>
Everyone keeps talking (rightfully) about how wonderful Brian's <br/>
carvings are. I, myself, have finally achieved a state of zen in <br/>
which I have seen carving ability the like of which I'll never be <br/>
able to replicate myself.<br/>
<br/>
I want more.<br/>
<br/>
So do you.<br/>
<br/>
Hence, I would suggest that the best way to give TGD the motivation <br/>
to continue bestowing such works of art upon us is to VISIT THEIR <br/>
BOXES! For those of you who haven't done the Time Travels and Let It <br/>
Be series, GO DO THEM. Make a small road trip to the under-visited <br/>
southern MA region. Find their mystery boxes (we're still workin on <br/>
em). You won't regret it and we'll all continue to benefit!<br/>

<br/>
*realizes this is kinda off track*<br/>
<br/>
The day before the POE gathering, did you take a hike down to <br/>
Burlingame to do the Favorite Ornaments Series?  We went down quite <br/>
late (after driving all the way around the park until we found the <br/>
entrance), and found Mushroom and Broken Heart - and realized that <br/>
you and Binx had been there the same day!  What time were you up <br/>
there, the morning?  We got stumped on the third box, due to the fact <br/>
that there were two E-W lying logs and we dug under many rocks - but <br/>
not the one that had the Cuckoo Clock.<br/>
