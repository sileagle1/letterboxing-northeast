that we'd stumbled onto an unexpected box in Merrow Park when we <br/>
were chasing monsters in Mansfield, but now we can't figure out what <br/>
the box is called.  The stamp was in two pieces (intentionally?) and <br/>
has the word "WOLF" carved into it.  We noticed some other monster <br/>
hunters had also found this one accidentally (it sort of jumps out <br/>
at you), but we can't remember who.  If anybody recognizes this <br/>
stamp, would you let us know what it is called and maybe who planted <br/>
it?  Thanks!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-74944926">"Wolf Shoes" I believe. It looked like it was intentional that it was <br/>
two rather than one stamp. We stumbled on this accidentally while <br/>
looking for another box.<br/>

fun finding the extra...with no clues. It just looked like a place <br/>
