great big thank you.  We had a great stress free day and I think we <br/>
make a pretty good team.  To all of our other helpers we thank you <br/>
from the bottom of our hearts.  It's folks like you who step up and <br/>
say how can we help that make an event like ours yesterday work so <br/>
well.  To all our friends new and old, thank you for coming.  A <br/>
special thank you to Ace from Mona for not bowling her over once <br/>
yesterday.  To the maker of the applecrisp, please send the recipe!  I <br/>
took a bowl home and I am going to have it for breakfast.<br/>
Again, thank you one and all,<br/>
Hez, Grumpy and Mona</div>
