<br/>
  I went out this morning and pulled it and noticed that the small wolf print stamp that was on the bottom of the hard {I can't remember what kind of material} thing is MISSING!!!<br/>
<br/>
I am hoping that it was accidentally dropped in someone's bag and went home with them.<br/>
<br/>
  PLEASE check your bags ASAP and get back to me.<br/>
<br/>
  I checked all around in the leaves while I was there and did not find it. I hope it wasn't dropped and a critter walked away with it. <br/>
<br/>
  There were quite a few finders this month, so I am really hoping that one of you will contact me with some great news that it is found. <br/>
<br/>
  I really don't want to send it on missing parts.<br/>
<br/>
  I need to send it by Monday at the latest though.<br/>
<br/>
  Please check those packs!!!<br/>
<br/>
  You can either post here or send me a note on AQ or e-mail me at<br/>
