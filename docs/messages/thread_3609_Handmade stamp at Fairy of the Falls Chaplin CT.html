  The Fairy of the Falls was a lovely little hike, and now , a new hand carved stamp -- can't wait to go back . Thanks.<br/>
  I just mentioned to Flutterby that Bluff was looking up again with your new box and then Rubaduc's also .  She told me there are others and they are not on line.  I would hate to go and then miss your other boxes.  How do I find the clues ??<br/>
