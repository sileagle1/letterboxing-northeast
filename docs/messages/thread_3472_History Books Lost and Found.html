Skowhegan event today! I was so pleased to see such a great turnout. <br/>
Thank you all for helping make today a fabulous success. :) <br/>
<br/>
We have one found item, and one lost. The FOUND item is a child's fanny <br/>
pack with a black watch inside. I think the fanny pack is decorated <br/>
with dinosaurs. I haven't unpacked yet so I'm not 100% sure about that. <br/>
<br/>
The LOST item is the CANDY APPLE COOTIE. It belongs with the circus and <br/>
needs to be returned to Scarab. Please let me know if you have this. <br/>
<br/>
I hope to see many of you at Uneksia's gather in June! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
