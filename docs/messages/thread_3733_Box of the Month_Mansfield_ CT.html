<br/>
    Today I replaced two of the letterboxes at Book Barn in Niantic, CT. Bookbarn and Relax and Read<br/>
<br/>
  I went to check on them a few weeks ago and the two boxes were there but the stamps were missing.  Today when I went to replace them I checked on my 3rd box, the<br/>
150,000 Books Letterbox, and the log book was missing but the stamp was there.  Please, please if you do these boxes try to hide them the best you can so that others do not find them.  <br/>
<br/>
  Thank you to all the people who have done these boxes.  I've enjoyed reading the comments and have shared them with Randy, the owner of Book Barn.  In fact I think he and his wife were as upset as I was about the missing stamps and log book. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Here's a link to the Box of the Month: Mansfield, CT: <br/>
<a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=59018" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=59018</a><br/>
<br/>
I believe the last 'box (Speedsquare's "Rose Garden") has been sent on<br/>
it's way, and we are now waiting for Flutterby to get the next 'box<br/>
&lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; the mail.  She will post on the list when she has rec'd and<br/>
planted it.  Good luck, so far some amazing carves have been shared!<br/>
