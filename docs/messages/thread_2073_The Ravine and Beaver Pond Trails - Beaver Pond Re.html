                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1581758985">Today we went in search of The Ravine and Beaver Pond Trails<br/>
letterboxes in Pomfret, CT.  The Ravine letterbox was fine, but the<br/>
Beaver Pond letterbox was completely buried in dirt and the inside of<br/>
the box was full of water.  Fortunately, the logbook had been<br/>
protected by its ZipLoc, but the ZipLoc with the stamp and ink pad<br/>
wasn't closed.    The stamp and ink pad are comletely soaked and<br/>
actually growing mold!  (I've seen wet boxes before, but never this<br/>
bad!)  We have brought the box home to (hopefully) repair it.  As soon<br/>
as we dry it out and fix it up, we'll return it.<br/>

mud from the box, I found the reason for so much water inside -<br/>
something (a beaver?) had chewed on the box.  We put everything in new<br/>
ZipLocs and a new Rubbermaid box and it is now ready and waiting for<br/>
letterboxers to find!<br/>
