  Enjoy!<br/>

<br/>
  I am back !!!  Had a wonderful time and happy to be home too .  The snow was so deep in Derry that I was housebound except for the small yard.  No place to even walk along the roads .   From house to car,  from car to shopping , and back , That is about all the exercise I got , but my jaw got too much from all the food . <br/>
<br/>
  today is wash laundry , and do errands in town . Also a long walk on the beach .!!<br/>
  How are you feeling ??  Has your cold stuck with you ?  Winter colds are hard for me to shake. <br/>
<br/>
  Heaven arrives this week - so hope we can get together and box with you or just have lunch , what ever fits into your plans.  I do not have any made yet . <br/>
If you are at loose ends on Friday and would like to go with me to pick her up in Green , I would enjoy that . Who knows, maybe we could find a letterbox close to the highway along the way ??<br/>
<br/>
  Talk later ,  Happy New Year .. Are you going out to celebrate ?<br/>
  smile<br/>
