got rained on, but it did keep the bugs away 8-)<br/>
I just wanted to let anyone know that is planning on going after this <br/>
series that it needs some TLC.<br/>
All of the log books are either FULL or SOAKED. One of the boxes <br/>
itself is cracked. I had run out of supplies by that point in the day.<br/>
On the positive side, I found all of the boxes and they are great <br/>
carvings!<br/>
