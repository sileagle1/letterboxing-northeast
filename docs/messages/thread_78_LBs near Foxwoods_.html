Happy Holidays!  Jay and I are going to the Pequot Native American <br/>
Museum at Foxwood this Saturday and would like to find some <br/>
letterboxes in that neck of the woods.  If you have any suggestions <br/>
(we are coming down 95 throught RI from Southeastern Massachusetts), <br/>
please let us know!  Thank you in advance.<br/>
