We enjoyed getting down to Hillsboro and finding the Town Pound,  Grimes Field and the Franklin Pierce Homestead.  We also got the Basin Letterbox and the Pemi-Trail Letterbox over the weekend.  All were in good shape and fun to find.  Hopefully we'll run into some other letterboxers one of these days.  We have had contact with a couple locals so maybe we'll be able to do an exchange soon.<br/>

I have a question on counting finds and Hitchhikers.  I think the HH count as finds, is that correct?  Also, I remember reading about someone talking about the lack of HH on the trails.  It was suggested that people are saving them and bringing them to gatherings.  Does that mean if you go to a gathering where there are 10, 20 or even more HH that you can include them in your find count?  This doesn't sound right to me but maybe I am not understanding what is going on.  I'd love it if someone would straighten me out on this.<br/>
