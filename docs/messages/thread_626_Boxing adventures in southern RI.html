We finished up the "Signs of Life" LB Series. Thanks to Moonstone Baby for a great series - it's a beautiful walk  with just enough space beteen the stamps. <br/>
The first time we went out, we had the old clues and decided to not go to the other starting point. Glad we didn't now. We probably could have finished the series in one fell swoop, if, we had bothered to check the web-site for up-dates to the clues. Now, we will do just that.<br/>
We also did maintenance on the :"Island Sanctuary" LB. The moldy stamp is gone. We refreshed the red ink, again. And, put the whole thing in a new and improved (read: bigger) box. There was never enough room for hitch hikers in that little, $$$ tupperware* box. Now, for half the price we have twice the room. Remember, if you're using the "old" directions to this box, the Eagle Scouts have added a first trail (that makes 3) to an observation overlook. These overlooks are well worth the extra steps to see the salt marsh up close and personal. Just watch out for the Poison Ivy - I kind of remember there being some very old, very large plants out there on one of our first treks to the Sanctuary last year.<br/>
Good Luck and Good Boxing<br/>
