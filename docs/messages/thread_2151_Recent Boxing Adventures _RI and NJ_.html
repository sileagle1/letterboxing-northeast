Knockham Hill Turtle LB - great hand carved stamp, unfortunately it's cracked into two pieces (still usable);<br/>
12 Months of the Year LB Series - Summer - We forgot the updated clues so we have to go back for July <br/>
                                                                  (it moved from an obvious party spot)         <br/>
                                                                  Lesson learned - Always update your clues before you leave!<br/>
Meander to the Marsh LB - Got Great Blue and Red Fox , nice hand carved stamps; beautiful area.<br/>
The Crossings LB - This one has a wonderfully creative log book, great job! <br/>
                             There were a couple of Geocachers in the area but they ignored us.<br/>
Hour of the Olympics LB series - Wasn't sure if this series was still there, but thought we'd give it a try. <br/>
                                                We weren't sure if we wee in the right spot for box #1, so we kept walking. <br/>
                                                It started to rain so we cut the hike short, but found #3 on the way out - Lucky us!<br/>
<br/>
The first weekend of June found me visiting Dave in New Jersey.<br/>
First the Mysteries (in no particular order)<br/>
A Mooving Tale was fun, Pete and Wanda were there 4 years ago amnd their F # was only 716!<br/>
Bought the Farm is a beautiful spot with a great handcarved stamp.<br/>
70 Million Years Ago is also a handcarved stamp and has a great hiding spot.<br/>
Happy Trails LB - Once you solve the code this one is a walk in the 'park'. Another creative log book!<br/>
Pine Barrens Tree Frog LB - good thing the weather was dry - don't think I would have done that road if it were wet!<br/>
                                          I'm finding alot of similarities between the Pine Barrens of NJ and South County, RI!<br/>
We were also able to find :<br/>
Pinchy!Pinchy! LB - careful, with erosion this spring, half of the log steps are missing.<br/>
Buttercup LB - nice handcarved stamp in a tricky spot. Make sure you go to the larger of Haddon Heights parks.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, Cherry Hill has a brandy new big Public Library with a great Reference Desk Staff - very helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Spelled How? LB - took a bit of finding (there's no sign southbound into Glendora), <br/>
                            great stamp and lovely spot except for the mosquitos!<br/>
Haddonfield Hadrosaurus Microbox LB - was planted by Silver Eagle visiting from Texas <br/>
                                                            and has a very nicely handcarved microstamp.<br/>
Saddler's Legacy LB -  has a beautiful Tree of Life stamp, really well carved. This is a really nice park to walk in.<br/>
                                   (we checked for the temporary bonus box, but it wasn't there - oh well)<br/>
Unfortuneately, The Paint Works LB appears to be missing, we were pretty sure of the spot based on the landmarks, but just some spread out rocks behind the tree and some evidence of a party spot. Still this walk around the Lake yielded some encounters with Canada Geese (with goslings), Mallard ducks and painted turtles. So, not a total loss!<br/>
Didn't think we get to do so much Letterboxing with Dave down in NJ and me up here in RI! <br/>
Looking forward to more NJ Letterboxes!<br/>
