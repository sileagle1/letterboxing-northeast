you who presented an entry are to be congratulated! <br/>
<br/>
We're in the west so I'm nut sure how fair it is for us to vote (ours was the <br/>
first vote and it was kind of neat to see 100% on our choice!). Makes us want <br/>
to have our very own logo for us LbNor Cal letterboxers in the west!<br/>
<br/>
Good job all around!<br/>

to wear on a pack or jacket.  It was hard to pick a favorite but I did.  Now <br/>
to see which one wins=and how fast we can all get them on our packs!  Wonder <br/>
who will be the first to sport one and be seen on the trails?<br/>
BookWorm, who now has a new, colapsible hiking stick from RTRW for Christmas. <br/>
 Guess what I gave her!<br/>
