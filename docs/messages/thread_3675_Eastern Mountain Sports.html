letterbox planted at easter Mountain Sports in Simsbury.  I was <br/>
contacted by the Manager Mike that they are having a 20% off every <br/>
thing in the store sale this coming friday and saturday for ALL <br/>
LETTERBOXERS!!!!  Seeing as I spend about 40% of my paycheck every <br/>
month at EMS this makes me very happy.  So if you are interested all <br/>
you have to do is show up at the store with my printed out clues for <br/>
the Sparky Butterfly Namesake box at EMS.  I will also put another box <br/>
there just for the weekend.  Clues to go up on thursday.  Have a good <br/>
week<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2064207712">good lord, what are you buying at EMS every month?  i find them to be<br/>
way overpriced (even at 20% off), and a lot of their clothing isn't<br/>
even practical for "real" outdoorspeople (holy lots of cotton,<br/>
batman!).  i am committed to my EMS boots, however.  have you tried<br/>
campmor.com or sierratradingpost.com for better pricing?  the latter<br/>
can be hit or miss, but a bargain is worth the hunt!  well, just<br/>
thought i'd mention it, in case you want to only spend 25% of your<br/>
paycheck.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
by the way, this sale is at all ems' for members of outdoors clubs,<br/>
too, and i believe usually available online.<br/>
