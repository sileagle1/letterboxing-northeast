                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-616452516">I'm sorry to say that this box is missing.  Logging happened in the <br/>
area and the tree which the box was hiding under has been cut down, and <br/>
stump removed.  The box may still be there hiding in it's hole, <br/>
however, extensive logging debris is scattered all over the area and <br/>
prevents me from searching the ground.  <br/>
<br/>
I wonder if I left a metal pen in the box!!!  Would a metal detector <br/>
pick up the spiral from the logbook through the plastic <br/>
container???????  ANy ideas????  I'm now thinking that geocachers with <br/>
their ammo cans would have been a good idea.....  (Note... call Dad... <br/>
ask to borrow metal detector....)<br/>
