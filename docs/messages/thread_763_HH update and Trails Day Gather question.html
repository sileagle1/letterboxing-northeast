haven't seen any updates on Alan's page. Safe Trails.<br/>

heard had made other non-camping arrangements (mother's place) for <br/>
sat. night, so will not be camping... Alan did ask for our <br/>
names/addresses if we were to camp. We are going to try and arrive <br/>
early for trail maintainence, etc. (and to meet everyone!) <br/>
<br/>
We do need directions to the place (not familiar with the Danbury <br/>
area) ... can anyone supply directions from rt.4/rt.7 cornwall/kent <br/>
area?  with limited directions, i've been known to 'spiral in' to <br/>
places, several hours late!<br/>

Looking forward to meeting other boxers!<br/>

I was wondering if you can help me.  I have been in touch with the people at <br/>
Tarrywile and they have not heard anything from Alan regarding camping this <br/>
coming weekend.  If you know how to contact him other than his e-mail address, <br/>
he needs to get in touch with the folks at Tarrywile as they have not made <br/>
provisions for camping as they have not heard from him.  I only found out after I <br/>
e-mailed them directly because I hadn't heard from Alan either.  I would hate <br/>
for people to get there and not be able to stay the night.  Any help you can <br/>
give me would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Deb<br/>
