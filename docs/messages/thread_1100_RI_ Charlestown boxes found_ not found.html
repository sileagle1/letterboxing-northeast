Seafood Festival on Saturday (highly recommended!). While in the area<br/>
we also knocked off a handful of letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
L'il Rhodster was found in place, dry, and intact.<br/>
<br/>
Nibiru aka Frosty Drew was found in place, dry, and intact.<br/>
<br/>
Perfect Summer Day was not found. I have heard no word on this box<br/>
since August 4, 2003 when the placer posted that she had a recarved<br/>
stamp sitting in her car, "ready to go."<br/>
<br/>
Uprising was found in place, dry, and intact.<br/>
<br/>
A mystery box was found in place, dry, and intact.<br/>
<br/>
Another unpublished box was found in place, dry, and intact. Thank you<br/>
to the placers who left this clue for us!<br/>
<br/>
The Orange Zest HH was found with the above. We'll move it along.<br/>
<br/>
Green Trails Quest: Library Quest was found in place, dry, and intact.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, an unpublished box in South Kingstown was not found. I've<br/>
already communicated with the placer and learned our mistake.<br/>
