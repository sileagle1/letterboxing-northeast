                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-375905880">fibrohugs and i have just returned from a search and rescue mission of a few<br/>
new hampshire boxes. <br/>
<br/>
stone arch bridge has been recovered. yes, the bridge is damaged and unsafe.<br/>
fortunately knowing where the box was i was able to rescue it safely.<br/>
<br/>
franklin pierce was floating in 2" of water. have brought it home also.<br/>
<br/>
wildcat could have been saved if and i repeat IF the last boxer had made<br/>
sure it was sealed. the box was found in it's hiding place floating in a<br/>
foot of water, the lid off and the stamps ziplock not sealed so the stamp<br/>
and inkpad were soaked. the log book was no where to be found. <br/>
<br/>
i can not stress enough.... if you letterbox have respect for the boxes!<br/>
have care for that which others left behind for you to find. have courtesy<br/>
for the person that will come after you. make sure those boxes are sealed<br/>
well and hidden well. <br/>

delay the elements, no plastic manufacturer intended these little gems to sit outside 365 <br/>
in drenching rains, hurricanes, floods and otherwise natural disasters.  I blame myself at <br/>
times for poor placement and not enough plastic bags, but I don't think I'd be surprised if <br/>
all of my boxes are completely flooded after this noreaster!<br/>
