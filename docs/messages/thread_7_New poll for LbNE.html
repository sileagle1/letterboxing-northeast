I think it's fun to see HHs no matter how I "find" them--in a box or <br/>
at a gathering.  I think it's nice that people bring them to <br/>
gatherings.  It's a great chance to see other carvers' handiwork.<br/>
<br/>
I have only found HHs in boxes two times, so if it weren't for <br/>
going to a gathering, I would hardly ever see them.<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER, if the launcher of an HH states in the logbook that <br/>
they do not want it brought to a gathering, I would respect their <br/>
wishes.<br/>

</span></blockquote>That's what log books are for.  I enjoy showing off all the stamps <br/>
I've found--hitchhikers and otherwise--but I don't need to bring the <br/>
actual letterbox to do it.<br/>
<br/>
And here's the thing: My logbooks have stamps from 26 different <br/>
states, six different countries, and countless different carvers.  <br/>
No hitchhiker gathering could compete with that, and that's just my <br/>
logbook.  Imagine all the other logbooks that show up at gatherings!<br/>

guilty of suggesting a HH exchange at gatherings. The origional intent of<br/>
the HH exchange was sort of like a grab bag. You bring a HH, toss it in a<br/>
basket and take another in exchange to hide where ever your letterboxing<br/>
travels bring you. The intent was not as a stamping frenzy but it was a way<br/>
for HH's to travel to different locations and even different States. One of<br/>
my HH's that began in Connecticut was brought out to California and released<br/>
via a gathering. I think it's a fun exchange and a great way to sent HH's in<br/>
new directions<br/>
<br/>
Now that I've cleared the air and my conscience I will bid you all well.<br/>

different from the choices....my feeling is that I would rather find HH's in <br/>
boxes, but that I feel compelled to stamp into them at gatherings, so I don't <br/>
miss out on them. So, my beliefs and my actions don't jibe, but I think others <br/>
may feel that way too.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't like to see all the pages of one of my HH's taken up at one place, <br/>
at one gathering, since it limits the places it can travel to before it gets <br/>
full. I'd much rather see that it has traveled far and wide and gets filled <br/>
with the people who carry it on.<br/>
<br/>
I would certainly honor the requests of a placer not to bring a HH to a <br/>
gathering if it was so stated in the log (or, in this case, requested on the list).<br/>
<br/>
It's a mixed issue for me about stamping into them at events, but a clear one <br/>
when it comes to my own boxes and when following the wishes of a placer. If I <br/>
know a placer doesn't want it done, I wouldn't do it. (Of course it means one <br/>
more thing to keep track of)<br/>

mother's 45th birthday (shhh, don't tell her I told you!) and I don't know <br/>

We have the boxes planted at each of the fields, <br/>
and have nothing but trouble. Several boxes have gone missing <br/>

If there's an overwhelming response to keep them active, we may<br/>
reconsider, but it's not likely.  If you're thinking about getting<br/>
them, you may want to plan on sooner than later.  <br/>
<br/>
We will definitely post what we've decided to do once the poll is done<br/>
so people have a chance to try to get them. <br/>
<br/>
Glad people have enjoyed them &amp; are looking forward to getting them. <br/>
It's a fun series, just very high maintenance.<br/>

&gt; Enter your vote today!  A new poll has been created for the <br/>
&gt; LbNE group:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are thinking of retiring the CCBL series of 10 boxes.  <br/>
&gt; We have the boxes planted at each of the fields, <br/>
&gt; and have nothing but trouble. Several boxes have gone missing <br/>
&gt; that we've had to replace. Some have had to be moved for one <br/>
&gt; reason or another. We are thinking however to keep the stamps <br/>
&gt; available in another way. We're still working on that. So the <br/>
&gt; question is, how do you feel about this series being retired?<br/>
&gt; please vote for one with the * as well as one from 1-6 thank you <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   o 1. Don't do it, I haven't been there yet. <br/>
&gt;   o 2. Its a good idea, just do it <br/>
&gt;   o 3. wait i'm coming May-June 2006 <br/>
&gt;   o 4. wait i'm coming July-Aug 2006 <br/>
&gt;   o 5. wait i'm coming Set- Oct 2006 <br/>
&gt;   o 6. I don't really care.  <br/>
&gt;   o * yes but reuse the stamps <br/>
&gt;   o * no retire the stamps completely <br/>
&gt; <br/>

Here's my $.02 on the matter regarding a high maintenance series. I<br/>
poured a lot of time and effort into a series of my own, only to<br/>
eventually see the boxes dwindle with a passing season. Nearly all of<br/>
them have to be recarved and replanted completely. <br/>
<br/>
Did I give up? No.<br/>
<br/>
Did I learn some important things about urban box planting? Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Will I replant them? Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Will I continue to keep my series active no matter what happens? Most<br/>
likely, despite the grumbling, the boxes that go missing and the<br/>
people that whine about this and that. <br/>
