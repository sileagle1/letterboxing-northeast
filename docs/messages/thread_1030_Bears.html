Others have seen it (them?), but as yet, I have not.  The discussion of<br/>
wearing bells reminds me of the talk a park ranger was having with a<br/>
group of tourist before they left on a hike. Most of the tourists were<br/>
decked out with bells to let the bears know they were in the woods.  He<br/>
explained there were two types of bears in the woods; black bears and<br/>
brown bears. The ranger told them that if they came upon bear poop they<br/>
could identify it by its contents. Black bears eat berries, seeds, and<br/>
nuts. Brown bears were carnivorous. To tell the difference he said black<br/>
bears' poop contains seeds. Brown bears' poop contained little bells.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, we have black bears here in CT.<br/>
