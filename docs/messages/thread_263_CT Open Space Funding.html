your legislators to push for funding for open space preservation.  I <br/>
received the document from West Farms Land Trust in Waterford...as <br/>
part of this funding WFLT was able to purchase about 1/2 of the <br/>
property up at the Avery Tract (where I happen to have quite a few <br/>
boxes!).  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone likes to politically instigate, or even if you just want <br/>
more land purchased to letterbox on, you may want to take a look at <br/>
it and make some calls.  I'll guess the governor's office is a little <br/>
busy given the current "Rowland-gate" investigation...however voices <br/>
starting at a local level might get funding secured.<br/>
