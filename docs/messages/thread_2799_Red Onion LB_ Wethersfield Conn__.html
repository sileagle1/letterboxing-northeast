    The series that had the red onion lb was pulled after someone at the Webb-Dean house found out that two of the boxes in the series were on their property.  They asked that I remove them.  This was the first series I planted and realized long after that I should have asked them before putting them on the grounds of the houses.  The Red Onion box was planted down by the cove and for some reason we have still not gone and pulled that one, although with flooding it may or may not be there still.  Feel free to plant your box. Our toes are not stepped on.  In fact I'd be happy to have another box to look for in Wethersfield. Please let me know when you plant it so we can get out there and box.<br/>

     Thanx for e-mailing the clues to me.  I was able to get out this <br/>
afternoon after work to look for the *ORIGINAL* Red Onion LB.  I <br/>
found it!<br/>
     The last log entry/stamp was dated 13.Feb.'05.  It was in place, <br/>
well hidden, and everything was bagged inside the box and in GREAT <br/>
shape.  There was a little condensation in the box and the stamp was <br/>
damp but the log was high and dry on top of the stamp.  Nice stamp!  <br/>
I duly stamped-in and recorded F109! :D  <br/>
     Just my humble opinion but I think you should re-list this 'box <br/>
on the LbNA and/or Atlas Quest sites.  THANK YOU  for the find.<br/>

    Thanks for the information about the Red Onion LB I'm glad you were able to find it and it was in good shape. I've considered relisting it but just haven't gotten around to doing it.  I won't list it if you'd prefer I didn't. On the other hand there is any reason we couldn't have 2 Red Onion LB's out there.  There is so much history in this town related to them.  Let me know because either way is fine with me.<br/>

Thanx for e-mailing the clues to me. I was able to get out this <br/>
afternoon after work to look for the *ORIGINAL* Red Onion LB. I <br/>
found it!<br/>
The last log entry/stamp was dated 13.Feb.'05. It was in place, <br/>
well hidden, and everything was bagged inside the box and in GREAT <br/>
shape. There was a little condensation in the box and the stamp was <br/>
damp but the log was high and dry on top of the stamp. Nice stamp! <br/>
I duly stamped-in and recorded F109! :D <br/>
Just my humble opinion but I think you should re-list this 'box <br/>
on the LbNA and/or Atlas Quest sites. THANK YOU for the find.<br/>

&gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt; The series that had the red onion lb was pulled after someone <br/>
at the Webb-Dean house found out that two of the boxes in the series <br/>
were on their property. They asked that I remove them. This was the <br/>
first series I planted and realized long after that I should have <br/>
asked them before putting them on the grounds of the houses. The Red <br/>
Onion box was planted down by the cove and for some reason we have <br/>
still not gone and pulled that one, although with flooding it may or <br/>
may not be there still. Feel free to plant your box. Our toes are <br/>
not stepped on. In fact I'd be happy to have another box to look for <br/>
in Wethersfield. Please let me know when you plant it so we can get <br/>
out there and box.<br/>

a <br/>

&gt; Then I printed the clues for RTRW's Wintergreen Woods series. The <br/>

&gt; available. I am a fresh-fish (noob), having only started in <br/>
&gt; Nov. '05. Does anyone have information on when and where it was <br/>
&gt; planted? And is this 'box still viable or has it been <br/>

if <br/>
&gt; the original 'box is still out there or to duplicate one that was <br/>
&gt; recently retired. <br/>

&gt; The "sixtyfourthousanddollar" ($64,000) question is, envelope <br/>

&gt; This is the second time I've started working on an idea for a LB <br/>

DO re-list your Red Onion LB!  &lt;insert *Nike Swoosh* here&gt; Just do <br/>
it. :D <br/>

I'll convert my LB into a hitchhiker.  I've been considering sending <br/>
out some sort of HH anyway, and I carved the stamp onto 1/2 of a <br/>
vinyl eraser, so it's small.  Besides, the Wethersfield Red Onion was <br/>
originally developed FOR EXPORT!  Maybe it should begin its journey <br/>
