<br/>
I was on the heels of Grumpy, Hez, Mona Dog and Miss Piggy today at the Montville Conservancy.  It was nice to cross paths with some fellow letterboxers, especially when you're being approach by someone as you're rummaging through plastic baggies and Tupperware containers.  Only a letterboxer would understand. : )  I thought flutterbyand fatcat did a great job of carving the Pooh characters, capturing their animated expressions.  When I got to Tigger, I remembered that he was one of my favorite.  I even named my first cat after him.  Once back at the car, I took a count, because I knew I was getting close to 500.  I was extremely excited to discover that Tigger was the F500!  I got a little teary-eyed pondering over the last 1 1/2 years of seeking for boxes and thinking of all of those wonderful people who spent their time creating so much fun for all of us to experience.  Thanks to all of you!<br/>
