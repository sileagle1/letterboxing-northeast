Trust preserve.  My intent was to find the series entitled "State <br/>
Symbols" placed by Willington Gang, plus pick up a few other boxes <br/>
along the way. The hike up (and down) the Ridge trail to box #1 was a <br/>
tad slippery, but found box, intact, with a well carved stamp of our <br/>
state flower. On to #2 of this series- this box was also in good <br/>
shape but the logbook is almost totally full. I stamped on the back <br/>
side of a page which  found empty when flipping through the logbook. <br/>
  Stamps in this series are very well carved plus there is historic <br/>
info. provided at beginning of logbook. I do hope the placers will <br/>
get more boxes out on the trails for us to find, please?<br/>
  At this point I decided to stamp into other l.b.s  off the same <br/>
trail I was hiking. "In Search of Phantom Kangaroos", recently placed <br/>
by Chuck and Molly is doing fine. NeeDeep's "Delaware Stamp" is also <br/>
intact.  Both of those stamp-ins add to my tally of gathering the <br/>
stamps of favorite series placed placed locally.  <br/>
  At this point I ran out of steam and time before dusk. <br/>
  I shall return to this gorgeous park to hike on the Ruby Trail and <br/>
find boxes 3-5 of the State Symbols series. Hopefully there will be <br/>
time to complete the Julia's Trail loop also.<br/>
