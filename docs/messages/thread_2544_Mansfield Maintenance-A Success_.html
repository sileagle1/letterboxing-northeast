dubbed "The Mansfield Maintenance Crew") replanting some of Leader of <br/>
the Pack's boxes that needed a little TLC.  Hats Off to Pinetree who <br/>
organized this undertaking, and to all those who logged miles checking <br/>
on the condition of boxes, many I'm sure they had already found! <br/>
Several of the stamps had to be re-carved, and some of the boxes that <br/>
had gone missing had to be replaced altogether. It shouldn't surprise <br/>
me that when there is a fellow boxer in need, there are boxers who <br/>
step right up there to help.  THIS, my friends is the BONUS of <br/>
Letterboxing!  It was great to see familiar faces, Sojourner, Vinny, <br/>
Molly, Music Woman, Paul Mapline, Chuck, Molly, Chickabirdie, <br/>
CatLover/Gardener/Teacher and of course PineTree and Leader of the <br/>
Pack.  There were also some new friends to be made: Golden Girl and <br/>
her Mom, and CatLover's friends.  Thanks to all that helped make the <br/>
day a success, and thanks for letting me be a part of it!  MayEve</div>
