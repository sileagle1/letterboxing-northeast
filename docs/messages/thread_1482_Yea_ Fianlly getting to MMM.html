for one friend and her 3 kids! We chose boxes that were quick and <br/>
easy to get to, got 11 total, 2 were not MMM boxes though. Even left <br/>
a HH in one of them! It was a cold day and rained threatened us but <br/>
we had fun...wish I could do more! We had hoped to find others out on <br/>
the trails, but didn't run into anyone! can't believe how full the <br/>
journals were!<br/>
