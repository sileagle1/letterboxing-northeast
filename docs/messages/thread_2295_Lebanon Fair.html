the letterboxes were planted in good places and the stamps are fantastic <br/>
.  It was fun to talk to Queen B and meet two of her daughters plus her <br/>
husband  while at the cookie booth.  I pigged out on the cookies , they <br/>
were delish.<br/>
Thanks   for all your hard work giving us letterboxes a real nice reason <br/>
to head for the Fair.<br/>
