                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-913520623">OK so today we decided to head out boxing with Stacy's mom.<br/>
<br/>
We started off looking for the Pheonex Tree but the clues were too<br/>
confusing and we couldn't find the turn off so we gave up.<br/>
<br/>
Instead we continued on and found the Melanie (friend) box at the MDC<br/>
reservoir in West Hartford.  But was soaked so we dried it out the<br/>
best we could put new bags on everything and replanted it.<br/>
<br/>
From there we headed over to Canton.  We visited Mill's Pond Park and<br/>
first found the Runaway Soccer Ball.  We got kinda confused because if<br/>
you count from the ditch there was another sitting tree about 11 paces<br/>
from a dead tree...but we eventually found it.  Stupid Ivan soaked<br/>
this box as well.  But once again we dried everything out and replaced<br/>
the bags.  However the ink pad was moldy so we had to throw that out<br/>
as well, so be aware that there is no more ink pad in this box.<br/>
<br/>
While we were there we also looked for the artistic dog poo.  It was<br/>
kinda a cool sculpture.  We interprated it as being a worm that the<br/>
fish above it would eat, who would in turn be eaten by the birds above<br/>
that, but not sure.  Anyway not trouble finding the box and it was in<br/>
great condition, no repairs needed.<br/>
<br/>
Finally we decided to look for "think outside the box" on talcott<br/>
mountain in Simsbury.  We always love that walk, done it a million<br/>
times but never knew about these side trails that they were on.  Found<br/>
the box in great condition.  Just changed the outter bag since it was<br/>
starting to get lots of holes in it.  However we were surprised that<br/>
it appeared as if no one had logged in to the book in about 2 months.<br/>
<br/>
All in all a pretty successful day.  Now its time to rest up so we<br/>
have a lot of energy to letterbox in mansfield all next month.<br/>
