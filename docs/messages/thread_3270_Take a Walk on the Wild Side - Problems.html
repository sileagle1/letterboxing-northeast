                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-312008207">Well, the good news is that I incorrectly stated that dogs are not welcome at the preserve.  They must be on a leash, so please feel free to bring your dog(s).   :  )   The bad news is that the last box with the logbook is missing - poor Grizzly.  :  (  If you visited these boxes since they have been planted and I haven't spoken to you about them today, please contact me offline.  One more problem is the reading for the first box is off by 100 degrees, but I don't know in which direction.  The clues reference a stone wall and the 258 degrees does not point to the stonewall.  I need to go back and get a new reading, but try either 158 or 358 degrees.  That's all I can tell you for now.  I would like to re-carve the last stamp and replant it in another location, but I have other obligations the next week or two and I don't think I will be able to get to it until then.  I will send an e-mail out when all the corrections have been made.  I put notations in the clues for now.<br/>
<br/>
  Sorry for all the confusion.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks and Enjoy!<br/>
