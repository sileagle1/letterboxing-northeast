I know about where is box is. (I don't want to say too much as it is a <br/>
mystery box) Went to look for it once, but didn't find it. I was <br/>
wondering if anyone here has found and can help me out at all. I'm not <br/>
sure how bad this area flood at the end of June and the box might have <br/>
been washed away - if not removed before that. <br/>
Any info would be great.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
