the hiding place was just a little too exposed.  We did out best to <br/>
rehide it carefully (more carefully than we found it), but I agree, <br/>
that location just screamed "party place!".<br/>
<br/>
Too bad.  It was a nice hand carved stamp.<br/>

I've seen the black lab with the red bandanna (I think that's you) <br/>
lately.  I really like that one, too.  This leads me to a question.  <br/>
My signature stamp, two aqua blue handprints and the words "Leave <br/>
your mark", is also store bought.  Over the summer, I really figured <br/>
out how to carve and am now making a personal traveller.  (If you go <br/>
to the Monster Mash and have a tatoo story to tell me...yours or <br/>
anyone else's...you'll get a traveller for your log book!)  I'm also <br/>
thinking about changing my sig stamp.  I don't know how I feel about <br/>
that, though.  There are so many people that I associate with their <br/>
stamps and maybe someone else is doing the same for me...what does <br/>
everyone think???<br/>

</span></blockquote>I was once a set of black musical notes with a pair of dark <br/>
sunglasses, signing as czf, then I had my run-in with the <br/>
Charlestown, RI police, after which I morphed into the blood red <br/>
image of Joan of Arc with a big-assed sword as Warrior Woman.<br/>
<br/>
When I box alone, or box with intermittent boxing companions, I box <br/>
as Warrior Woman.<br/>
<br/>
When I box with Tatanka, who was my inspiration for carving the <br/>
Lakota Sioux Tribe stamp for the Four Directions series, and a <br/>
regular boxing companion, I carved my alter ego, Lakota, and we stamp <br/>
in together as The DreamCatchers.<br/>
<br/>
So, for instance, at the MMM, Tatanka and I will be attending <br/>
together, and I will stamp as Lakota, even though *everyone* knows me <br/>
as Warrior Woman.  I think it is fun!<br/>
<br/>
And, for the record, I should get your personal traveler, since I am <br/>
going to get my tattoo tomorrow, so it will heal in time for the MMM!<br/>

  As far as signature stamps go...(which this thread seems to have <br/>
turned into?).<br/>
<br/>
   It's your OWN stamp, do what you want!  We had our original <br/>
little stick figure thing, carved the day before we went <br/>
letterboxing.  <br/>
<br/>
  While in SF, (to see Metallica, planted a box there but now it's <br/>
here), we picked up a local paper and saw a neat picture thing for <br/>
some club or something and thought, "That's us".<br/>
<br/>
 I carved it and now our "sig" stamp is Team Primate (or M &amp; C)?<br/>

It was a hard decision for me to change my signature stamp even <br/>
though it was store bought for the reason you mention.  I waited <br/>
until I found an image that I really identified with before I <br/>

Back to the conversation....<br/>
I was thinking along the same lines as you mentioned, moonstone.  My <br/>
personal traveller is an image that I love but I wanted to keep it <br/>
closer to me and more under my control. I want to carve a new <br/>
signature stamp for myself and think I will when I find an image <br/>
that resonates.  Haven't found it, yet, so it'll just be me and my <br/>
blue hands at the MMM!  See you all there....this is my first <br/>
gathering and I'm psyched to put some faces with trail names and <br/>
signature stamps, not to mention ending this feeling that I'm the <br/>
only one out here in this area!<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails,<br/>
