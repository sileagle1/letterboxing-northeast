We went in search of "Optimists' Loop" "The one that got away" and "two-fer".  They were all in excellent shape.  What a great location for boxing.  We biked it but on foot would be fun too.  The rail trail along the winding river was beautiful.  We couldn't have asked for a better day and the kids loved this adventure.  <br/>
