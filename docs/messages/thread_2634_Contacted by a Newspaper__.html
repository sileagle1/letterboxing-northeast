I edit the Life section of East Bay Newspapers and I'm working on a <br/>

local people who place boxes. Do you have a few minutes to spare by <br/>
phone? If so, just e-mail me back and let me know how I can reach you.<br/>

  "As the twig is bent, so grows the tree" - if people discover letterboxing and the courtesies of it early on, then we can hope that they will be more respectful than some boozing youngsters who stumble upon a box and make mischief.<br/>
  Besides, it's in the holiday spirit to share good things...<br/>

  out, but I know a lot of boxers have complained about too much <br/>
  press.  Any thoughts.  I have not contacted him just yet and probably <br/>

<br/>
*HE* (the reporter) found out about letterboxing somehow, didn't <br/>
he?  If he can figure it out, let others figure it out the same way. <br/>
Please don't do the article.  There is no reason at this point, with <br/>
the proliferation of boxes, articles, websites, etc. that anyone who <br/>
is looking for something fun to do can't find out about it.<br/>
