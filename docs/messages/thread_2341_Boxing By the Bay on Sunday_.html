<br/>
Just a reminder to bring a folding chair for yourself and a brown bag<br/>
lunch for the event on Sunday. There are some good lunch options in<br/>
Belfast such as Bell The Cat (at the intersection of Route 1 and 3),<br/>
the Belfast Co-op (down the street from the City Park) as well as a<br/>
few other spots. I highly encourage those who are staying overnight to<br/>
have a classic shore dinner at Young's Lobster Pound.<br/>
<br/>
Phyto and Isosceles will be offline until Sunday. Please print your<br/>
own clues to bring with you and share. The event begins at 10am and<br/>
will go until 3pm. See you there!<br/>
