<br/>
In light of the hiking death in another section of the same park over the <br/>
weekend, I've decided to permanently retire the Taughannock Falls box near <br/>
Ithaca. While the box itself is not in a dangerous location, there's a good <br/>
possibility that the park rangers will now frown on visitors travelling to <br/>
the other side of the stream bed to find the box and I'd rather not <br/>
encourage any sort of activity that might get a finder in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who have visited the box over the past three years - <br/>
Taughannock Falls is a truly special place.<br/>

As an alternative, could you consider replacing the box in an area<br/>
that does not require moving into restricted areas?  There seem to be<br/>
a number of places along the trail leading to the gorge that could<br/>
house a letterbox, if I recall correctly -- somewhere along the trail<br/>
to the left of the parking lot, I thinkg (been a while since I've been<br/>
there).<br/>
<br/>
Just a suggestion in an effort to see the box stay available.<br/>
