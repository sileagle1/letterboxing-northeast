<br/>
To kick it off right, I wanted to offer up a mini-meet at 5pm in the community room prior to the workshop, so we can do exchanges, share personal traveler stamps, and have social time. So if you can drop by prior to the workshop, please do! Also feel free to stay for the presentation to add your thoughts and experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Space is limited in the room and we need to be sure to leave space for folks who are brand new and attending the workshop. Please take a moment to sign up on Atlasquest if you can make it:<br/>
