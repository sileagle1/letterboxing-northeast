public knowledge. <br/>
I learned about letterboxing in May of last year when I good friend of<br/>
mine took me to the May Day gathering. If it wasn't for her then I<br/>
would never have found out about it. So word of mouth is good!<br/>
But the media has already found out about our hobby and published it<br/>
so there isn't a whole lot we can do to stop the spread. Like someone<br/>
else mentioned it could be bad, if boxes start getting trashed and or<br/>
stolen, but it can be good because it could also bring out some GREAT<br/>
carvers and placers. <br/>
I have been on the hunt before and found a box completly trashed and I<br/>
recovered what I could. So I'm sure the vandalism isn't all because of<br/>
the media. It will happen to some boxes no matter what you do. We just<br/>
need to become more inventive concerning our clues and think "outside<br/>
the box"(no pun intended) when we plant them. <br/>
I am up for the challenge.<br/>
