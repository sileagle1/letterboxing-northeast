                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1556116386">I stated when I posted my letterboxing clues for Manchester CT that once all World Titles change hands I would retire the series.  The last champion left is John Cena, and there are rumors floating around that he got injured last week and will be out 6-8 months, meaning tonight he will lose the title.  If this is true, then I will retire the clues this week.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to say it will be tomorrow, but I am sure I will get lazy and wont get to it until at least Wednesday.  So I would say if you are interested in getting it, now is your last chance.<br/>
