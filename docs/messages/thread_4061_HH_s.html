                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-262222862">I found a HH called "Eco-Hiker #6". It says it was planted by "Halls @ Fort". I found no record of anything called "Eco-hiker" on LbNA or AQ. Halls @ Fort is not on LbNA, but I did find "Halls at Fort" that just registered on AQ on 10/1/09 and has not logged in since that day. They have no plants listed. The HH doesn't have a log book either. <a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/people/profile.html?gMemberId=35872" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/people/profile.html?gMemberId=35872</a><br/>
<br/>
Any idea how I can log it? I tried to contact "Halls at Fort" but I'm not sure they will write back since they haven't been on since the day they registered. What to do??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
