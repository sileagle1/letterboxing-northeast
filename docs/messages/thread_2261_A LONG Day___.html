                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-364164854">Me and Pigtographer headed out to Swan Point Cemetery in Providence,<br/>
RI, yesterday, to find the 12 box series.  I think Pigtographer hit<br/>
the nail on the head, as she's been saying "I think we've been<br/>
spoiled, between our two MMM trips and the Winter boxing drive in<br/>
January."<br/>
<br/>
Last outing we had was in April, where we ended up being 1/4.  Well,<br/>
yesterday we were 0/12...however, we did find a mystery box somewhere<br/>
in Providence.  So 1/13.  So the day wasn't totally wasted.  But Swan<br/>
Point Cemetery is a city within a city, and we became so confused by<br/>
the clues that we gave up after hours of searching.  C'est la vie!<br/>

P.S. Hopefully we'll be able to come to Mach 3!  We were planning to<br/>
go to Mach 2, but something came up.</div>

even find one box!<br/>

Frustrating, but still a nice outing.<br/>
