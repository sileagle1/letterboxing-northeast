&lt;&lt;&lt;Hello;<br/>
I am a biologist studying an invasive stinging ant that is spreading in New <br/>
England. We are seeking help from parks, nature centers, and similar <br/>
organizations to find locations of this species. It is the only ant in <br/>
Massachusetts<br/>
that readily stings people. The sting is painful and may cause swelling<br/>
and itching for a day or two, so anyone unfortunate enough to run into<br/>
this insect usually remembers. For this reason, we are often able to<br/>
locate the ant through reports from people who are active outdoors.<br/>
Please<br/>
let us know if you encounter stinging ants in your area. Specific<br/>
locations are very useful, such as street addresses or names of rivers,<br/>
ponds or other landscape features. Negative answers are also helpful.<br/>
We'd be happy to answer any questions. The ant, Myrmica rubra, is sometimes <br/>
called the "European fire ant."<br/>
They are reddish brown and about a quarter of an inch in length. Some<br/>
basic information (including a photo) is available from Wikipedia:<br/>
