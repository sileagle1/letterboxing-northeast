<br/>
But first, a funny story. <br/>
Last month Dave and I discovered the box was missing, only a small piece of grey felt remained - no logbook, no stamp (Dave's first stamp carving attempt) and no broken remnants of the box! So, we went home determined to recarve and replant! This was afterall the first box that we planted. We had adopted Island Sanctuary and used a store bought stamp for the box.<br/>
This past Saturday we went to the Giant Boulder with new box, stamp and logbook in hand, and even a new HH to seed the box. Dave peeked into the crevice and said - "Hey! What gives?!" There was a large locking type box with the old stamp, the old logbook and a few pieces of paper sitting there! No one ever contacted us, so it must be a Letterboxer who doesn't use the chat list. Yes, there really are people out there who just box, in fact some of them don't even log their finds! :) <br/>
<br/>
So, our great big thanks to the mystery maintenance crew! If they had left a note we could have found some way to reward them!<br/>
We now have a spare stamp for the future - we left the original stamp with a new logbook. The HH has already been moved along :(<br/>
<br/>
Things like this make you feel good about the Letterboxing community!<br/>
