   I just thought i would share the boxes we did this  weekend so far, the <br/>
successes, and the not so successful. <br/>
<br/>
1.  Zodiac #3....Success!!!!<br/>
<br/>
2.  Khnum and the Lotus Blossom....Failure on both <br/>
<br/>
3.  Zodiac #9....Success!!!!<br/>
<br/>
4.  Mountain Park....Failure on all four, although we didn't  even try for <br/>
all of them, the place seemed very dangerous, what with broken  glass, rusty <br/>
everything, and very overgrown. #1, we didn't see a gazebo at all,  #2 missing, <br/>
#3 couldn't find where they were talking about, #4, probably  missing, to much <br/>
unsafe material, leaves, clothing and trash to even look much.  I was kinda <br/>
creeped out being up there, the kids loved looking around though. <br/>
<br/>
5.  Chickadee....Failure....we couldn't find it, not to mean  it wasn't <br/>
there, i am not sure we went right at the right fork. oh well, we will  try again. <br/>
<br/>
6.  Golden Fawn....we had found this on a different trip, and  checked while <br/>
we were there, it was there, along with a few thousand mosquitos,  we didn't <br/>
sign in just verified it was there and all was good.<br/>
<br/>
7.  The Horse Escape....Success!!!!.........and there was only  maybe 1 <br/>
thousand skeetos at this one, lol. Thanks for the  treat!!!!<br/>
<br/>
8.  Hampton Ponds....Failure, my clue sheet was old, and  i checked when we <br/>
got home and found that it was confirmed as  missing.<br/>
<br/>
I think that's all of them, if anyone has any info on our failures,  if they <br/>
didn't find them either, or our successes if they know they are there  and we <br/>
just have to look better. We had a nice 2 days of  boxing!!!<br/>

gazebo, and all the other landmarks... even though there is an empty <br/>
barrel next to every fire hydrant!  I think they're all missing too.<br/>
I found Chickadee a while back, so can't help you there. Take Care! <br/>
