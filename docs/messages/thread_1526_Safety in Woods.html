                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1151562503">Thanks very much to recent posters about personal experiences and <br/>
warnings. I purposely left the Lion's Club fields until tomorrow as I <br/>
need to get to Nassiff's and buy an orange vest.  Bells will be added <br/>
to my pack before I go out tomorrow. <br/>
 Yes, Mr. Spignessi (not sure of name spelling and do apologize) was <br/>
a D.E.P. worker on the job who was shot by a hunter violating rules <br/>
for hunting after dusk. I don't believe the case was successfully <br/>
prosecuted. As a letterbox in the Rock Springs Preserve states, he <br/>
died "In the line of Duty". <br/>
