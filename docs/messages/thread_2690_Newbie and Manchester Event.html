<br/>
I just joined this group.  I want to take this opportunity to thank <br/>
everyone who were so friendly and answered my questions at the <br/>
Manchester event on Sunday.  I had a lot of fun talking to others and <br/>
observing the activity.<br/>
<br/>
Next time I meet you all at an event, I'll have a stamp (or two) of my <br/>
own.  BTW....my trail name will be "moonspinners"<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day!</div>
