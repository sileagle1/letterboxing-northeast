<br/>
I currently live in Portland, Oregon, but I'm moving to Boston<br/>
temporarily for school.  I'm just going to be there for the fall term,<br/>
but I'm looking forward to doing some letterboxing and meeting other<br/>
letterboxers!<br/>
<br/>
I've read on Atlas Quest that there's going to be a gathering on Oct<br/>
1st that seems to be nearby.  Does anyone happen to know if public<br/>
transportation goes there from Cambridge?  Or is anyone planning to<br/>
carpool?<br/>
<br/>
Also, if anyone has suggestions of letterboxes near public<br/>
transportation in the area, I'd love to hear your recommendations. <br/>
I've never been to New England before, and I'll be there by myself. <br/>
So if anyone want to hook up for some letterboxing, I'd love that too!<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to seeing your beautiful area and great letterboxes!<br/>

I'm glad to hear there are boxes in range of the T.  I'm so used to<br/>

going to be more than a little annoying until I get used to it.  But<br/>
then, I'm originally from Montana, where if you don't have a car, you<br/>
don't get anywhere.  Unless you have a horse.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
I doubt I'll miss the rain, but I'm not sure about all the snow you<br/>
all have out there.  It's been years since I've had to deal with snow<br/>
on a daily basis.  I prefer it just at Christmas time.  :)<br/>

Of course there's specific times but most conductors don't mind if you have<br/>
to bring a bike on. Once you have a bike, man, now you can go anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Salem, MA is on the same line to Newburyport (all Essex County).  It's a 20<br/>
minute ride from Boston. I've placed a few in Salem which are actually<br/>
pretty easy  to find and not too bad on bike (in fact I biked all of them<br/>
when I was finding a place for them) and will be placing some more, and the<br/>
Marblehead Bike Path has one which is close to one of mine.<br/>
<br/>
Than there's Lynn, a few stops before Salem.<br/>
<br/>
AND OH, than there's the Alewife Station one which is at the end of the Red<br/>
Line. From there you can take the Minuteman Bike Path to Arlington and<br/>
Lexington. There's several there. Of course I'm not 100% sure how close some<br/>
of them are to the bike path. The bike path takes you right into downtown<br/>
Arlington and Lexington.<br/>
<br/>
Okay. I'll stop.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
PS I can't even imagine having an addictive, time consuming, hobby like<br/>
Letterboxing while in school.<br/>

know I will have to find some time for it.  I've got to get out now<br/>
and then!  But it will be hard to resist the temptation to go more<br/>
often than I should...<br/>

&gt; It's kind of a pain, but you can take a bike onto the T and commuter<br/>
trains.<br/>
&gt; Of course there's specific times but most conductors don't mind if<br/>
you have<br/>
&gt; to bring a bike on. Once you have a bike, man, now you can go anywhere.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Salem, MA is on the same line to Newburyport (all Essex County). <br/>
It's a 20<br/>
&gt; minute ride from Boston. I've placed a few in Salem which are actually<br/>
&gt; pretty easy  to find and not too bad on bike (in fact I biked all of<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; when I was finding a place for them) and will be placing some more,<br/>
and the<br/>
&gt; Marblehead Bike Path has one which is close to one of mine.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Than there's Lynn, a few stops before Salem.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; AND OH, than there's the Alewife Station one which is at the end of<br/>
the Red<br/>
&gt; Line. From there you can take the Minuteman Bike Path to Arlington and<br/>
&gt; Lexington. There's several there. Of course I'm not 100% sure how<br/>
close some<br/>
&gt; of them are to the bike path. The bike path takes you right into<br/>
downtown<br/>
&gt; Arlington and Lexington.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Okay. I'll stop.<br/>

&gt; I doubt I'll miss the rain, but I'm not sure about all the snow you<br/>

&gt; on a daily basis.  I prefer it just at Christmas time.  :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi!  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I currently live in Portland, Oregon, but I'm moving to Boston<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; temporarily for school.  I'm just going to be there for the fall<br/>
term,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but I'm looking forward to doing some letterboxing and meeting other<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxers!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I've read on Atlas Quest that there's going to be a gathering on Oct<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1st that seems to be nearby.  Does anyone happen to know if public<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; transportation goes there from Cambridge?  Or is anyone planning to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; carpool?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, if anyone has suggestions of letterboxes near public<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; transportation in the area, I'd love to hear your recommendations.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I've never been to New England before, and I'll be there by myself.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So if anyone want to hook up for some letterboxing, I'd love<br/>
that too!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I look forward to seeing your beautiful area and great letterboxes!<br/>

I'll be finished around mid January, so I don't imagine I'll avoid all<br/>
of it. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, since we rarely see snow in Portland, even a flurry will be<br/>
worth writing home about.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the gathering:  The earliest commuter bus arrives after the<br/>
event starts.  Is anyone driving from the Boston area who wouldn't<br/>
mind giving me a ride?  I'd be happy to pitch in on fuel.<br/>
