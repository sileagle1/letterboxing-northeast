of you whose stamps we have encountered on our boxing<br/>
travels.  Couldn't stay for the full time so we also<br/>
missed a lot of you.  Hope to catch up with some more<br/>
of you at a future event.  I wondered why the event<br/>
stamp said "Letterboxer's Companion"!  Sorry to have<br/>
missed Randy Hall - but we have his book!  Thanks,<br/>
Mark and Sue for putting this together. <br/>

transition) ;-)</div>
