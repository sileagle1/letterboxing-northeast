We kept looking within the wall - pullin rocks out and looking in the crevasses - with no luck.  It was at the bottom of the stone wall in the same area.  There was a hole in the bottom of the wall, the box was on the ground, under the stone all and a rock was slid into the hole.  Very crafty hiding place!<br/>

Enjoy!<br/>
