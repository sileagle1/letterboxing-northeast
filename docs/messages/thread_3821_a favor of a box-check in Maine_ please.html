Wondering if there's someone who lives or works close to Naples/Sebago <br/>
Lake State Park who might be able to check on one of my quick-and-easy-<br/>
to-get-to boxes? We'll be camping there in August, but I'd like to know <br/>
that it's OK since we weren't there last year and nobody has emailed me <br/>
that they've found it in a LONG time....<br/>
Please reply off-line.<br/>
Many thanks!<br/>
