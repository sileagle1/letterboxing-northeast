regional talk list for all you folks in the Northeast.  I guess the <br/>
secret is out, though, since this temporarily "secret" talk list now <br/>
boasts of EIGHT members.  It's hilarious.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow....  Team Green Dragon has stepped up offering to take the <br/>
reigns of this board--which is certainly more logical than me who's <br/>
only stepped foot in the northeast once in my lifetime.  (Well, okay, <br/>
a million or two steps to be precise, but you know what I mean....)<br/>
<br/>
On a couple of notes:<br/>
<br/>
When I created the board, I set the Links section so moderators could <br/>
update it, but members can only view it.  Ideally, I see it as a <br/>
single source for all webpages related to letterboxing in the <br/>
northeast.  So if you wake up one morning and think, "Hey, didn't <br/>
that Jay Drew guy hide a box in such-and-such place?"  But for <br/>
whatever reason he didn't list it on the main talk list--probably <br/>
because the National Park Service is hot on his track.  How do you <br/>
find the clue?  Ah-ha!  Go to Links and there's his website!  <br/>
<br/>
I'm kidding about the NPS thing, btw.  They're really after me and <br/>
Amanda, not Jay.  =)  But I digress....<br/>
<br/>
I'm not really sure how often it is on the Pacific Northwest board I <br/>
created, but I love the feature and use it often when I want to look <br/>
up somebody's website.  To keep the section from becoming cluttered <br/>
with all sorts of unrelated information, though, only the moderator <br/>
can update links in the section.  I added a few links I knew off the <br/>
top of my head or were easy for me to find, but if you know of others <br/>
to add, let us know!  =)<br/>
<br/>
Oooh, another for-instance: I know Wanda and Pete have a website for <br/>
their hitchhikers because I've seen the webpage before.  But where is <br/>
it?  I don't know!  How do I find it?  I don't know!  Guess I'd e-<br/>
mail them (or someone else who I knew had the website) to find it.  <br/>
But if it was in the Links section, it would be easy for anyone to <br/>
look up.<br/>
<br/>
So, in a nutshell, it would be great if the Links section could be <br/>
the single, best place on the Internet for a list of all Northeast <br/>
letterboxer webpages.  (There's not one already, is there?  Because <br/>
I'm assuming there isn't.  Not being from the area, I wouldn't know <br/>
stuff like that.  Another good reason I shouldn't be the owner of <br/>
this board!)<br/>
<br/>
Hmm....  That's all I can think of.  Hey, Green Dragon--should we <br/>
make the offical announcement for the opening of this board?  =)<br/>
