Munjoy Hill Observatory has been revived and is back in place with a nice new log <br/>
consisting of the re-constructed old logbook pages (that were quite damp) and <br/>
additional pages to hold new visitors. I have also added postcards to the Observatory, <br/>
Baxter Woods Series, and Box #15 of the East End Series.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately due to the celebrations of the Center for Cultural Exchange at the <br/>
corner of State and Congress, we only checked on 1/2 of the Portland Series. I can <br/>
confirm that the following are gone: Boxes #4, 7, and 8. The others are alive and well. <br/>
The "science" box - (number escapes me) is also mia - but I just can't remember the <br/>
number. Didn't have the clue set with me, so well, it is quite a challenging find. <br/>
<br/>
Bug Light Glyph sadly is gone.<br/>
<br/>
Fort Allen Park is alive - though it is not covered so well - my bad.<br/>
<br/>
Key to the City is doing very well.<br/>
<br/>
Still haven't gotten out to the Riverton Trolley Park...and finally, CBP's "Casco Bay" box <br/>
really eluded us - we're just not sure on which bench to begin our pacing out on the <br/>
east end. <br/>
<br/>
Finally, a total of 3 hitchhikers were deposited in requisite boxes....Windairen's <br/>
"Compass", and Isoscele's "Fermi" and "Rutherford" Physics in a Can hitchhikers.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun out there!<br/>

I could not get to #9 due to the fact that upper Congress Street was blocked off as I <br/>
stated before, due to the Center for Cultural Exchange event. I wasn't even interested <br/>
in trying to wade through the crowds because they had events in Congress Square <br/>
(where Union Station and #9 is) and it was just too much.<br/>
<br/>
I have not checked on 10, 11, 13 and 14 though I am pretty sure only 14 is missing. I <br/>
also checked on the final #15 log. Even though it is a bummer that they're gone, I <br/>
don't really mind re-carving them and am happy that there was no logs inside. I'll <br/>
replace those 4 or 5 boxes next time I'm visiting Portland.<br/>

July 25 when we toured Portland with TeamGreenDragon. 14 was tough <br/>
but luckily Brian is very persistent and has long arms! We couldn't <br/>
find 2 (guess we should've kept looking),7, 8, 9, 12.<br/>

Can't wait until these stamps are replaced, as this series looks <br/>
awesome in my logbook and I'd like to complete the page! <br/>

</span></blockquote>I can promise you that I will recarve and plant the missing boxes, it just has to wait <br/>
until the wedding is over!! :) I've already started thinking about how to recarve <br/>
them, it was such a long time ago when I did those. I carved them all exactly a year <br/>
ago - in August, and I didn't get around to finishing that series until the spring of <br/>
this year. So, the carving is the easy part! The clue writing was a pain.<br/>
<br/>
I'll post when those are replanted. Perhaps by September? Just in time for the end <br/>
of tourist season - and another good visit up north?! <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-12190665">well, what a trip to portland yesterday. not being a city girl it was quite<br/>
an interesting experience. having parked the car we started our adventure.<br/>
after walking forever and a day it dawned on us that we were at the location<br/>
for the clues to the last box. after a bit of sitting and contemplating this<br/>
situation we decided the course of action would be to do the series<br/>
backwards. <br/>
<br/>
#15 found <br/>
#14 found (and yes brian it was a long reach) unfortunately there was not<br/>
stamp in it. there was a little note saying had to remove to stamp in a safe<br/>
location and would return it on august 10th. bummer.<br/>
#13 found<br/>
#12 already reported missing so we didn't look<br/>
#11 found<br/>
#10 could not find<br/>
#9  we could see the circle but there was a movie going on and so had to<br/>
just keep on walking. what the heck did they have to pick that time to watch<br/>
a movie for!<br/>
#8  already reported missing so we didn't look<br/>
#7 already reported missing so we didn't look<br/>
#6 found by this time it was getting dark so was easy to get and put back.<br/>
we were ready for the break.<br/>
#5 could not find. think i found the pointed rock but there was no stamp<br/>
near it. by this time it was really dark and i was not into groping around<br/>
with a policeman sitting across the street watching us. <br/>
#4 already reported missing so we didn't look<br/>
#3  found<br/>
#2 found the monument. found the rock in the roots but could not find the<br/>
stamp. could still be there as it was pitch dark by this time but i really<br/>
don't  think it was. <br/>
#1 that hill is dark at night so we could not even see the stump. nice thing<br/>
is tho we discovered a short cut back to our car.<br/>
<br/>
the short cut now is a whole different story. we discovered at box #1 that<br/>
our car was parked on the other side of the bay. we have no idea how to get<br/>
back there without backtracking. figuring a kid living on that side is not<br/>
going to walk the blocks it takes to get to a normal path to reach the beach<br/>
area there had to be a short cut. there was. we found it. <br/>
<br/>
all in all a lot of fun. we will be back. more prepared next time, with a<br/>
city map and not leaving our wallets in the car. (boy were we starving). i<br/>
can hike 10 miles in the mountains find a box and hike back. these urban<br/>
boxes are hard! thanx for the challenge and adventure.<br/>

and write a note, place this in the box and then return the box to <br/>
it's hiding spot. Why couldn't they put the stamp back? <br/>

glad to hear that 'yall are taking the losses in good stride, it kills me - this series <br/>
