Letterboxing.  We had arranged a meeting with Queen B and family to <br/>
retrieve a lost "Digiwalker" that had escaped from my waistband while <br/>
boxing in the Hidden Cemetery a month ago.  Queen B found it and <br/>
introduced us to the Lebanon Green Market in order to return it to <br/>
me. Perfect spot for what we needed to do- nice big tables,and a box <br/>
to find,too!!!  We had a happy time exchanging stamps and stories.  <br/>
We then went on to get 2 more boxes B4 heading home on snowy roads.  <br/>
Travel was slow, but we returned home without incident.Happy Warmer <br/>
Boxing to all :0)- Sunshine, Swamp Yankee, and the ToadDog (who loved <br/>
running on the soccer field in the snow!)</div>
