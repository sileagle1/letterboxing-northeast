Even if there were none, the yummy desserts and the neat, unusual stamps may well hold their attention.  There's really not a whole lot of structure to events, so don't worry too much about what you need to do or not, just show up and enjoy the day before the two-year-old has a meltdown or stamps his sister all over with Frankenstein.  We've all been children - many of us still are!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1150170533">Dear Barbara, Mom of the Brush Bunch,<br/>
<br/>
First of all - RELAX !!!<br/>
<br/>
At gatherings such as these, there are children, dogs, big kids, <br/>
little kids, kids who sit on rocks ... (okay, I'm getting carried <br/>
away)<br/>
<br/>
Gatherings are FUN !! Children LOVE them !!  I've brought my own <br/>
three children to gatherings and they have a ball !!  Maybe they want <br/>
to do stamp exchanges, maybe they don't (often, they are willing to <br/>
stamp *anyone's* logbook, which helps folks up their X count, but <br/>
don't necessarily whip out their own log book), sometimes they want <br/>
to look for boxes, sometimes they don't.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone comes with their own agenda.  Some folks are deadly serious <br/>
about exchanging with every other boxer at the event, deadly serious <br/>
about capturing every box, deadly serious about keeping a list of <br/>
every single boxer's personal traveler clues - or not !!<br/>
<br/>
Some folks (like me) have been to so many letterbox gatherings that I <br/>
view this gathering as a sort of Halloween King Richard's Fair - I'm <br/>
there to have fun, to socialize, to hunt for boxes on Friday, <br/>
Saturday morning, and Sunday, to gladly offer an exchange should <br/>
anyone want to, and to enjoy the gathering's schedule of events.  <br/>
With this many people attending, I'd go *nuts* trying to keep track <br/>
of all of the little nuances and play that occur at smaller <br/>
gatherings.  To me, this is Mardi Gras, for adults and children alike!<br/>
<br/>
As for your children - it's all about running around like mad, having <br/>
fun with a bunch of truly fun and happy adults, making friends with <br/>
other children, visiting with every dog there, and eating the entire <br/>
dessert table before we get to it (and my thighs thank them).<br/>
<br/>
Can it be overwhelming?  Sure.  But a lot of us are parents <br/>
ourselves, and when those "times" occur (and they do), a break away <br/>
from the event, go off and box one or two boxes UNRUSHED, will often <br/>
help to ease the day.  Or just go for a walk, or stop at a library - <br/>
whatever it takes.  We've all been there, and we are all eager to <br/>
help.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any rules that say "You must arrive at the start time of <br/>
the gathering and must remain until the finale under penalty <br/>
of ???"?  Absolutely not.  I've hosted letterboxing events where <br/>
folks show up an hour early, folks have stayed the whole time, folks <br/>
have stayed for a half hour, folks have arrived just when I am <br/>
cleaning up.<br/>
<br/>
So - RELAX.<br/>
<br/>
So - ENJOY.<br/>
<br/>
So - HAVE FUN.<br/>

Had I known about letterboxing I would not have wanted to make her feel uncomfortable so I would not have brought her. If your kids are good with stranger why not bring two cars so the parent that wants to stay with the kids that want to stay longer can and the other can take those that are tired and cranky home. My daughter is a teenager and still needs a break, so will I for that matter. It's going to be great. That's why so many are going. They have been and enjoyed it. Go at your own pace and do your own thing........<br/>

surprised that it comes to us from Warrior Woman.  <br/>

At the last gathering we attended, our son spent his<br/>
time running around saying hi to everyone.  He had a<br/>
great time and he was asleep seconds after we got into<br/>
the car to go home.<br/>
<br/>
Listen to Warrior Woman!  She knows of what she<br/>
speaks.  Make the gathering your own and enjoy the<br/>
parts you like.  Skip the rest.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Gatherings are FUN !! Children LOVE them !!  I've brought my own <br/>
&gt; three children to gatherings and they have a ball !!  Maybe they <br/>
</span></blockquote>want <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to do stamp exchanges, maybe they don't (often, they are willing to <br/>
&gt; stamp *anyone's* logbook, which helps folks up their X count, but <br/>
&gt; don't necessarily whip out their own log book), sometimes they want <br/>
&gt; to look for boxes, sometimes they don't.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Everyone comes with their own agenda.  Some folks are deadly <br/>
</span></blockquote>serious <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; about exchanging with every other boxer at the event, deadly <br/>
</span></blockquote>serious <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; about capturing every box, deadly serious about keeping a list of <br/>
&gt; every single boxer's personal traveler clues - or not !!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some folks (like me) have been to so many letterbox gatherings that <br/>
</span></blockquote>I <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; view this gathering as a sort of Halloween King Richard's Fair - <br/>
</span></blockquote>I'm <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; there to have fun, to socialize, to hunt for boxes on Friday, <br/>
&gt; Saturday morning, and Sunday, to gladly offer an exchange should <br/>
&gt; anyone want to, and to enjoy the gathering's schedule of events.  <br/>
&gt; With this many people attending, I'd go *nuts* trying to keep track <br/>
&gt; of all of the little nuances and play that occur at smaller <br/>
&gt; gatherings.  To me, this is Mardi Gras, for adults and children <br/>
</span></blockquote>alike!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; As for your children - it's all about running around like mad, <br/>
</span></blockquote>having <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; fun with a bunch of truly fun and happy adults, making friends with <br/>
&gt; other children, visiting with every dog there, and eating the <br/>
</span></blockquote>entire <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; dessert table before we get to it (and my thighs thank them).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can it be overwhelming?  Sure.  But a lot of us are parents <br/>
&gt; ourselves, and when those "times" occur (and they do), a break away <br/>
&gt; from the event, go off and box one or two boxes UNRUSHED, will <br/>
</span></blockquote>often <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; help to ease the day.  Or just go for a walk, or stop at a library -<br/>
<br/>
&gt; whatever it takes.  We've all been there, and we are all eager to <br/>
&gt; help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Are there any rules that say "You must arrive at the start time of <br/>
&gt; the gathering and must remain until the finale under penalty <br/>
&gt; of ???"?  Absolutely not.  I've hosted letterboxing events where <br/>
&gt; folks show up an hour early, folks have stayed the whole time, <br/>
</span></blockquote>folks <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have stayed for a half hour, folks have arrived just when I am <br/>
&gt; cleaning up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So - RELAX.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So - ENJOY.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So - HAVE FUN.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This public service announcement has been brought to you by no <br/>

I do agree with WW. It's fun, exciting, and tiring.<br/>
You know your kids. Do they like being around stranges<br/>
or do they cling to your leg at the thought of<br/>
stranges. My daughter was a clinger. Had I known about<br/>
letterboxing I would not have wanted to make her feel<br/>
uncomfortable so I would not have brought her. If your<br/>
kids are good with stranger why not bring two cars so<br/>
the parent that wants to stay with the kids that want<br/>
to stay longer can and the other can take those that<br/>
are tired and cranky home. My daughter is a teenager<br/>
and still needs a break, so will I for that matter.<br/>
It's going to be great. That's why so many are going.<br/>
They have been and enjoyed it. Go at your own pace and<br/>
do your own thing........<br/>

As for the boxes planted for the month of<br/>

some of those on Saturday, or staying at the gathering<br/>
all day?  <br/>
Seven hours seems like a very long day.  I really<br/>

As Chuck mentioned there are some parking spaces up the street at the school and maybe there are some people with large vehicles that would be willing to shuttle people down to the gathering.  <br/>
