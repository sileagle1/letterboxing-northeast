quests.<br/>
<br/>
First and foremost I must applaud Sapphireberry who poured MASSIVE <br/>
amount of time, energy , carvings and yes SWEAT into creating this <br/>
wonderful experience.. for a large number of folks who braved "bad <br/>
weather forecasts" and attended this event this was a special <br/>
one!....Most of the approximately 40 stamps came from her! Yeah some <br/>
of us contributed , but she exceded our efforts by <br/>
alot.......Bravo , seriously for your work.. You have shared an <br/>
experience that was truly unique.... I look forward to seeing all <br/>
the pictures that should come out of this.....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cooties, Art Goddess and I drove from Maine and though it was a <br/>
rainy drive down, the Olympians were clearly smiling down on us... <br/>
The weather was fine all day! Not bright sunshine but clearly good <br/>
enough to box! So clearly those who let weather forecasts decided <br/>
for them .. you all missed a great event!<br/>
<br/>
From the moment my companions and I arrived , you could honestly <br/>
feel the excitement and energy from those emerging from their rain <br/>
soaked vehicles and preparing for an amazing day of "quests"......<br/>
<br/>
To everyone that did attend should attest to , these were some fun <br/>
extensive hikes for boxes...Several time I hear people remark at how <br/>
much effort the organizers must have made to hide these boxes...<br/>
The park itself is an amazing location for visiting and yeah doing <br/>
some boxes..... I was fortunate on a couple of quests to work with <br/>
Lazy Letterboxer and Letterboxing Ham and learn more about this park.<br/>
I loved being able to hear share stories and watch 2 people I <br/>
respect solve some clues:) Thanks guys!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These gatherings are always wonderful to share time with all of you <br/>
that enjoy this hobby. I met many new boxers and reconnected with <br/>
several old friends :) More and more these events connect us all <br/>
within the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
A special thanks to those who shared some "fireside chat" and those <br/>
crazy night boxers who helped each other complete our 12 herculean <br/>
tasks at night :)Those night pictures should be umm interesting if <br/>
they make it online :)<br/>
<br/>
Again BRAVO BRAVO! to the Greek Gathering organizers and all the <br/>
letterboxers who attended and made this a wonderful experience for me<br/>
and my companions.<br/>

undertakeing well done (''''''applause'''''').  There was a great <br/>
amount of work involved in this gathering; the boxes, clues and <br/>
plantings were spectacular.  Something for everyone from the <br/>
children to the elderly and the 'mountain goat' I met while there.  <br/>
The rain was a dampening sight but we all pulled thru and did have a <br/>
great time.  Again thank you Heidi and Mom for a wonderful w/e.  <br/>
I have some photos I will be uploading as soon as I figure out how.<br/>
