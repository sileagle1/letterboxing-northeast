                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1722858777">I attended a meeting last week where Commissioner Gina McCarthy of the <br/>
DEP and two educators were talking about the No Child Left Inside <br/>
program.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Ms. McCarthy how she felt about letterboxing, and she was very <br/>
enthusiastic about it.  It gets people outside to enjoy our parks and <br/>
trails.  The two educators also said letterboxing is part of their NCLI <br/>
program coming up at Gillette Castle (I think).<br/>
<br/>
However she may not realize how boxes get there.  <br/>
