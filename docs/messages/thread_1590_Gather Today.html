<br/>
We are on for today. It is 6:45 and I am doing final car-loading in <br/>
the morning chill! If you are looking for a last-mnute food item, <br/>
Box-o-Joe from Dunkin Donuts (one on Route 81 in town, just <br/>
south of Route 80) would warm us up! I am bringing two <br/>
propane camp stoves and we will have a fire, so another idea is <br/>
hot cider. I will have beef stew simmering for lunch.<br/>
<br/>
One word of caution - cell phone coverage is very spotty in the <br/>
"hollow," but there is a pay phone by the beach.<br/>
<br/>
If parking becomes an issue, I often see cars parked along the <br/>
road outside the entrance.<br/>
<br/>
Bring hats and gloves! Yak Trax are good, too!<br/>
<br/>
See you all soon.<br/>
<br/>
