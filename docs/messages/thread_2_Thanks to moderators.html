As a significant amount of letterboxes (ers) are concentrated in the<br/>
New England area, IMHO I think this is a good step forward. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Mark for speaking out about moderation. The concept on a<br/>
talk list is necessary and frankly doesn't need to be debated any<br/>
further. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the decision to not include a "database" in the member<br/>
options menu bar. Good call.<br/>
<br/>
So, that was my thank you for the week. I don't see the need to post<br/>
unless there is something of substance to share with others. <br/>
<br/>
Good Day,<br/>

</span></blockquote>Oh goodness, thanks. The fun is just beginning. I think the "best is yet to be"<br/>
since it was the first, there is now another in place at a local library...and now <br/>
that I feel good about posting clues to that link you'll have many more. <br/>
<br/>
Mark feel free to link to our Clues web page. Folks, just think of it as your own <br/>
personal collection folder of top secret clues. I'll post here when there is new <br/>
information. Still working out a webring link. <br/>
