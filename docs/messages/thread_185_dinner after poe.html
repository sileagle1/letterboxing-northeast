The restaurant sounds great and the function room makes it even better -<br/>
our own private place! Is is possible that we might pick up 10 more and<br/>
maybe should reserve for 30? <br/>
Just a suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the checking out Tweeds. Does someone now have to carve<br/>
a Post-Event Stamp?<br/>
