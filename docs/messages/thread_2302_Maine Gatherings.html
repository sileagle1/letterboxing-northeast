boxes.The boxes that I've found have been impressive. So much talent out there!<br/>
   I'm noticing two Maine Gatherings that have intrigued me and I'd like to attend. Other <br/>
than food, what do fellow letterboxers bring to the party? Are event stamps carved by the <br/>
host of the event? I have so many questions!!!! If someone could just give me an overview, <br/>
I'd be grateful. Plus I wouldn't feel like such a novice. Thanks in advance. <br/>

Maine boxes are some of our favorites. There is a multitude of talent up there!<br/>
We have assembled 2 links from new letterboxers who wrote articles on their observations on attending gatherings for the first time. You might find them useful. They are located on the link below - right under the picture at the top of the page.<br/>

Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
