Imagine starting at the trail head where a sign is posted with pictures of poisonous and nonpoisonous snakes in full color and additional information about what to look for as well.  Imagine walking right next to a small pond and hearing a loud splash like someone just did a cannonball into it.  Imagine reaching through cobwebs of some unknown eight legged creature or being frightened by a bunch of squealing feral pigs that were in the brush!  Phew - terrifying, but fun!    <br/>

  Enjoy!<br/>
