                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1796174586">Last Sunday, Diane and I set out to discover the ancient past of letterboxing.  We had the clues for Breaking Hearts at Breakheart (which is now in the basement, I beleive).  We parked in the appropriate spot in Arcadia and set off through the wilderness to find this relic of yore.<br/>
    Walking the lovely path of stream and laurel, I remarked how Early Letterboxing Man, or Neanderboxer, set long hikes for their prey.  Could we be walking the very route of the Old Ones?  Would we find this artifact of proto-box after these thousands of days planted?  The placement date reads "January 1999".  That's eons ago, in the dimmest recesses of history!<br/>
    We find after the first stretch that a mile's hike brought us to another parking area - easily accessable by car.  So we see that Neanderboxers would choose the finer hike, rather than the easy kill.  Notes are taken, and Dr. Iva Notion at the Smithsonian is notified.  Theories are postulated and postulates are theorized.<br/>
    The next leg of the journey turns out to be about a mile long, and consists of a loop that takes us almost back to the second parking area!  Proof positive that Neanderboxer was an avid traveler!  Dr. Notion's collegue, a Dr. Ben Thinkin, wants to re-name the species Meanderboxer.  He is suppressed.<br/>
    The final, longest leg took us beyond all reach by automobile into the forest fastness.  We cast about searching for certain azimuths and 'V' trees.  What did they mean by this?  After hours of fruitless search, we find nothing.  Did Schliemann feel this way, questing for the ruins of Troy?  For the day, we must retire empty-handed.<br/>
    Further reseearch must be done.  Can there still remain, even today, survivors of this bygone era who may yet hold a clue to this box's whereabouts?  Could it have been by the hand of its creator or cosmically pulled?  The questions remain.<br/>

Breaking Hearts at Breakheart too.  I could not find it either.  I <br/>
wonder if the vegetation has grown so much in 5 years that the <br/>
landmarks are hidden?  I thought I got as far as the two sister tree <br/>
on the final stretch.<br/>

(PS I did not park where they started the hike.  I used my Arcadia <br/>
map to park at that second lot you mentioned.)<br/>
