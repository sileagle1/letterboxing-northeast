That's why birders need to use binoculars to see them.  In both <br/>
these cases, however, the Ruffed Grouse walked up to within a few <br/>
feet of me as I was sitting on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
The only other bird who is so bold is the Chickadee.  I have had <br/>
Black-capped Chickadees fly to my hand looking for seeds.  Groups of <br/>
them will perch on nearby branches when a person comes close.  They <br/>
are inquisitive.<br/>
