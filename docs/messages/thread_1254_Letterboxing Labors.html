Dave and I went camping in Vermont this past weekend. Our main purpose of the weekend was the camping, but on Monday before heading home there was work to do. <br/>
We visited the former site of the "Dis creek/de otter creek" Letterbox. It had been reported missing. The last time we visited the rocks were frozen together. I guess the spring floods loosened the rocks, because the place didn't look quite the same and the otter had swum away, probably downstream. We have deleted the old box and directions and planted a new box with a new otter. Hopefully he will stay and play with us a little bit longer than his cousin.<br/>
We also visited Lake St Catherine LB,  Alternate Energy LB and the Birds of a Feather LB Series. <br/>
Lots of mosquitos at the Lake St. Catherine box - from the logbook entries this appears to be almost always, so wear bug repellant.The Birds of a Feather Series was a very pleasant walk and the Alternate Energy box was also intact. There were alot of picnic-ers around but they didn't give us any notice.<br/>
Good boxing to all.<br/>
