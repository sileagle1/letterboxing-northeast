On Friday the 2nd, heartened by others' affirmation of its presence, we tried once more for Quintessential Quonochontaug ("Quonny' will do - don't sprain your tongue).  Sure 'nuff, there it was, safe and dry.<br/>
    Saturday we met up with Literate Lagomorphs, Pigtographer and Buddy for a visit to Canonicut Cannons and Island Sanctuary before heading out to Portsmouth, RI for the new Friends of the Leonard Brown House (it really isn't brown, you know) and the Twelve Months of the Year - Fall series.  All were in fine fettle and the walk was truly spiffy!<br/>
    Fortified by lunch at Cindy's in Portsmouth we drove over to Slater Park in Pawtucket and were joined by Stepho for Fox in the Box and a very tricky Fanny's Footsteps (The log was full, so we left a new one in with it).<br/>
    Saying our fond farewells, Diane and I swung west to see the Bald Eagle (remember: Bald is Beautiful!) and Naked Woman in the Waterfall and then The Fox in Wickaboxet.  Whew!  That was enough for one day, because we ALSO...<br/>
    Left some hitchikers along the waay, gathered at the Moose Hill Gathering (can't let them just sit around!) and visited The Warrior and "I Am Waiting and Watching for You" RI Mysteries.  No clues there from us, since we circumnavigated the state.  Ha ha!<br/>
    Yesterday, the Fourth, we did mostly family things.  To walk off a huge, yummy lunch we followed a hunch and found the Little Bear snug in his den.<br/>
<br/>
That's enough for one weekend!  Monday is a holiday for us and we're tying up loose ends, like this sitrep.  Happy Independance, all!<br/>
