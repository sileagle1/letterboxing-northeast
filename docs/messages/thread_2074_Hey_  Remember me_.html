 LOL<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thought I'd drop a line to say hello to my old letterboxing pals. <br/>
Thanks in large part to Warrior Woman, I'm back on the trails.  I<br/>
posted a message on the big board, so I won't babble on here.<br/>
<br/>
Suffice it to say, though, that I'd love to team up with some people<br/>
for some Massachusetts boxing.  Let me know if you want company!  I'm<br/>
game!  I'll be back in New York the next couple of weekends, but after<br/>
that ...<br/>
<br/>
(Actually looking to connect with some Western NY letterboxers ...<br/>
any1 out there?)<br/>
<br/>
Hope all are well ...<br/>
