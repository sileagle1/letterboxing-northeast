Too bad we didn't have the time that trip for the Chocolate Museum!  Being near the coast, I expect that the snows have receded.  I note that even Fort Kent is getting green.<br/>

  Hi all,  I know these boxes are in Canada but they were placed by New <br/>
  Englanders so I thought they might be interested to know they are <br/>
  alive and well.<br/>
