Park!  A nice turn-out of Letterboxers even with the unsettled <br/>
weather.  Quite a few brand new Letterboxers came, complete with lots <br/>
of enthusiasm!  AutumnGlory carved her first stamp there at the <br/>
Carving 101 class and made quite a work of art!  <br/>
     I really enjoyed meeting everyone there, and once again I <br/>
say, "what a nice bunch o' people letterboxers are...!" <br/>
     Thanks, Alan, for making it all happen, and everything worked <br/>
out fine in the end!  It was great to finally meet you, too!<br/>
     Happy 'boxing....Sue</div>
