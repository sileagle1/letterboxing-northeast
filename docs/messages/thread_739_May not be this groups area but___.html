                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1272443725">Tenant Falls letterbox is north of Northville, off Rt 30.  There's a <br/>
Sinclair? Point on Sacandaga also, on the other side, but it is <br/>
listed as "Saratoga Springs", where there are two boxes that truly <br/>
are in S. Springs.  There's a new one, going by the title something <br/>
like worst carved stamp or something like that.  This new one is <br/>
relatively close to Amsterdam, in case you're going north via that <br/>
jump off from the Thruway.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, if you're going north of Albany, there's also one fairly close to <br/>
the north end of I 787, listed on LBNA as My Birthday Box, really in <br/>
North Troy but listed as Lansingburg, NY--which is a "section" of <br/>
Troy.<br/>
<br/>
That's about it for the Capital District Area of NYS.  I'll be <br/>
placing one soon at a little known but spectacular location, but I <br/>
have to carve a stamp showing the largest waterfalls east of Niagara <br/>
first.<br/>
