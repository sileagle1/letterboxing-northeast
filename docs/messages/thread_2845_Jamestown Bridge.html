Her father and bBrother helped to build the bridge. My Father-in-law also worked on the bridge and will be able to view it's demolition from the Saunderstown side (on his 89th birthday). I found a few websites that have great pictures of the old bridge. Maybe even of the old resting place of the Drew Clan Letterbox. Too bad that one went missing before Dave and I started 'boxing 3 years ago. Dave and I planted a new series down in NJ in the Pine Barrens to commemorate different types of Bridges. Unless we find a local to adopt it, we will probably pull the series when Dave's active duty is done. But for now the "Bridges of Burlington County" does homage to the Jamestown Bridge (a combination truss and cantilever bridge) and 4 other types of Bridges.<br/>

For the Bridge Demolition, my mom and I ended up at West Ferry in Jamestown - it was quite impressive. I was surprised that there was no news coverage in Jamestown! There were people at West Ferry, Fort Getty and Mackeral Cove Beach. There were even people on the shoreline by the Creek, that's quite a walk.

<br/>
There's even a brand new wildlife sanctuary named after him.  Coming <br/>
south from Rome Point down 1A, heading toward Narragansett Town Beach <br/>
and just before the Sprague Bridge, a brand new sign went up on the <br/>
right side of the road about two weeks again that read "John Chafee <br/>
Wildlife Sanctuary".  I spotted it only because the bird logo BLUE <br/>
was so freshly painted it practically reaches out and grabs you as <br/>
you drive by.<br/>
<br/>
I think I'll be planting a "RI Refreshments" series in there.<br/>
<br/>
And I'm hoping to plant another Life Lessons from the Jukebox at <br/>
Trustom Pond.  So close to Moonstone Beach, it'll be the "they call <br/>
it the streak, but the police just call it indecent exposure"!<br/>

  &gt;   &gt; Well, looks like tomorrow is the day that the old Jamestown <br/>
  Bridge <br/>
  &gt;   comes down.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   The traffic here in Saunderstown is NUTS!  I was hoping to go <br/>
  down and <br/>
  &gt;   watch from Rome Point, but there are just TOO MANY PEOPLE!<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   Let's just hope the mass of muggles don't find any of our boxes <br/>
  down <br/>
  &gt;   there!  Trish has two, I have one, and you guys have a PILE!<br/>
