Fox, Bald Eagle, the Maplines and anyone else who put all the effort <br/>
into the May Day gathering! It was a lot of fun.<br/>
<br/>
Also we all thoroughly enjoyed meeting/visiting with all our fellow <br/>
letterboxers. You all are wonderful, wonderful people!<br/>
<br/>
We only regret our abrupt departure. I ventured out alone, managed <br/>
to get 3 boxes, then when I checked on my husband and daughter, I <br/>
discovered that my 3 yr old daughter had decided she'd had enough <br/>
and we had to leave without saying goodbye to anyone or staying for <br/>
the raffle and rest of the fun.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, the next gathering we attend will have nice weather so <br/>
our daughter can join in the hike and enjoy herself more.<br/>
<br/>
Happy letterboxing to all!<br/>
