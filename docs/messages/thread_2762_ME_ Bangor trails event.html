Wednesday evening about the prospects of creating an interconnected<br/>
public trail system similar to the existing Portland Trails system. I<br/>
encourage any of you living in the Bangor area to attend this. While<br/>
checking on my Prentiss Woods boxes, I noticed a poster announcing<br/>
this meeting at the trail kiosk. <br/>
<br/>
For those of you in Southern Maine, you're probably familiar with<br/>
Portland Trails and you can thank the initiative of those folks as<br/>
well as Saco Trails for their dedicated land acquisition efforts that<br/>
make your letterboxing adventures possible. I think this is a strong<br/>
community effort to unify the existing trails in this area, and we<br/>
will be attending as local voices in the Bangor area. The trail and<br/>
land infrastructure already exists up here, it's just a matter of<br/>
putting folks in charge. Please make your voice heard!  -phyto<br/>

Bangor Trails Event<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday, March 22nd at 7:00 pm<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Bangor Land Trust [BLT] and Keep Bangor Beautiful [KBB] will<br/>
present "Building a Community Trail System."  The speaker, Alix<br/>
Hopkins, is one of the founders of Portland's well-known city-wide<br/>
trail system, and the author of Groundswell: Stories of Saving Places,<br/>
Finding Community.  The sponsoring organizations feel that Bangor has<br/>
the beginnings of and potential for an outstanding system of trails<br/>
for walking, biking and recreation. They are seeking community input,<br/>
and Ms. Hopkins' presentation will be followed by discussion, and an<br/>
opportunity to contribute ideas.<br/>
