                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-853573772">I figured that subject line really caught your attention. I just needed to <br/>
post about what happened to me and my Presidential Series #1 yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
I went out to do maintenance on my boxes. I removed the logbooks from the <br/>
first 4 and have decided to only put logbooks at the end of each 5 box <br/>
series. I completed the first series and went on to the second when I <br/>
realized I missed a box. When I went back to do that box, which was the end <br/>
of series 1, I found a group of girl scouts at the box. I said hi, helped <br/>
them locate box 3 and figured I would come back another day to update that <br/>
box. Well, it was sort of nagging at me to finish the series and I figured <br/>
the one box would take me about 10 minutes so at 7:00 last night I dragged <br/>
Max back into the woods.<br/>
<br/>
To my utter horror I found the last box laying completely out in the open. <br/>
No attempt was made to hide it. It looks as if the last girl stamped in and <br/>
in a rush not to be left behind just tossed the box on top of the spot the <br/>
box was hidden. The lid was partly off and nothing was in a baggy. So of <br/>
course I had to check the rest of the boxes. EVERY BOX was in similar <br/>
condition. Totally out in the open the lids off and in one box the stamp was <br/>
sandwiched between the ink pad and the ink pad lid with the top off the box.<br/>
Even the box I helped the kids find before I left them I said in front of <br/>
the leaders to make sure it is hidden the way it was before you leave. Sure <br/>
enough it was just set on the wall in plain sight.<br/>
<br/>
If I had not gone back last night my entire first series would have been <br/>
lost either by vandals or by the rain. Thank goodness they didn't look for <br/>
Aarons B-Day box, that is in such a high traffic area it wouldn't have <br/>
lasted until 7pm.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is ADULTS if you take kids letterboxing YOU ARE IN CHARGE! <br/>
You can not expect 7 or 8 year olds to re hide a box the way it should be. <br/>
If there are too many kids for you to control take less. If you don't have <br/>
time to do an entire series just do one box but teach kids how to care for <br/>
the box, hide it like it should be  and have some respect for the hobby.<br/>
Even Max, who is 6, knows what is expected of him in regards to other <br/>
peoples boxes and letterboxing etiquette. Every child needs to be taught <br/>
that.  I put allot of care into my boxes and I certainly try to treat other <br/>
boxes like I would have my own cared for. I hope others do the same. We <br/>
would lose a whole lot less boxes to vandals if we did.<br/>
<br/>
I just want folks to pay more attention to how they leave boxes before they <br/>
move on. And if you can't take care of them please don't do any of my boxes.<br/>
