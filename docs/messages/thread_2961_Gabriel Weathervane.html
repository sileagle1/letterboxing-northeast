They informed me that this is actually a private park that allows the public to visit but is <br/>
not public (did that make sense?). Anyhow, there's an overly protective neighbor who <br/>
watches the park like a hawk and I didn't want boxers to get the third degree.<br/>
<br/>
 Seems Limur's YEAT box used to reside in the exact same spot and Pansey had to rescue <br/>
that box from the park's "guard" as she tried to stamp in. Ironically, Pansey was the first <br/>
finder of my box before I moved it today. That's one brave boxer!<br/>
<br/>
So, if you've printed the clues for the Gabriel Weathervane, prior to May 31rst, throw them <br/>
away! The clues on both LBNA and AQ now reflect the new location.</div>
