                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-870985066">Hi, Queen B here. It's called Hidden Cemetary for a reason!!! If you are coming from the center of town on Rt. 207, with the Red Brick Meeting House (the Congregational Church) on your right and the town hall on your left, go down the hill only part ways. If you come to the bridge, you have gone too far. Right now you will see penguins on your right. Just after the house with the penguins there is a small turn-off driveway on the right. It is just a small portion of blacktop leading to a grassy driveway. That is where you will find the hidden cemetery. Good luck. If you need further help, let me know and I can meet you somewhere and lead you directly there. Hope you enjoy the series.<br/>
Queen B<br/>
