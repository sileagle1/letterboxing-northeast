</span></blockquote>Peepers are a true sign of spring in the vernal pool ecosystem. It's<br/>
the spring peeper (a frog) that is the first to begin its mating call.<br/>
The ubiquitous "peep" is usually heard in the early spring evenings<br/>
around marshy/wetland areas or even in your backyard as these frogs<br/>
are tolerant of the light frost evenings when temperatures dip down.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a great description of spring peepers:<br/>

I'd be interested (bears shmears, snakes...taste like chicken... :p) <br/>
but can't get out on either the 28th or 2nd.  Where are the clues to be <br/>
found?<br/>

&gt; I would like to hike to this cave, if it's good weather on either <br/>
March 28th or April 2nd.  I don't want to do this alone, since I want <br/>
to climb into the cave, and want someone on the outside of the cave.  <br/>
Preferably someone who can keep a level head ;-), since I'm not so sure <br/>
I'm going to want to lower myself down into a cave once I get there ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe the snakes will still be hibernating????? Anyone game?<br/>
