I could hear him.... he's a fairly healthy eater, having a chicken salad sandwich with green bean salad, and a ginger ale..... <br/>
<br/>
How thrilling!  BTW... for those who don't know, he lives right near P on W I think in the Garth Road area...... Too bad I'm leaving town for Glastonbury (which is where Jen Risotti lives, and she is seen in Lotties for breakfast some weekends.......celebrity spotting is SO much fun!)<br/>

I worked in Tolland and would stop by on my way to work. He would be <br/>

way to the box. I was having a horrible allergy attack and he blessed <br/>
