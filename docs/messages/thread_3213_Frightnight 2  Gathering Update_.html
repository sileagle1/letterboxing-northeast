<br/>
Since we have been seeing alot of discussion on boards about mysteries, <br/>
mysteries and mysteries.. My creative tricksters and fellow organizers <br/>
are working overtime to included alot of surprises.....<br/>
<br/>
I received word yesterday from a very cryptic source who will be <br/>
conducting a carving class at our event. I never thought this person <br/>
would attend but I know of this person from afar :) The carvings are <br/>
wonderfully done..<br/>
<br/>
Lots of other surprises are slowly being leaked out in <br/>
announcements,emails and of course the event page.....<br/>
<br/>
I hope many of my fellow NE boxers and board members will attend...<br/>
