recommend seeking out this new mystery box. The search for the box itself <br/>
combined with the thrilling experience that was unexpectedly offered to us <br/>
after the find made this one of our very favorite letterboxing experiences <br/>
yet. The 3Bears deserve major accolades for this unusual (and beautifully <br/>
created) plant.<br/>

P.S. A little bird (or should that be bear?) told me that due to a special <br/>
event during the same weekend as the Finger Lakes gathering on June 11th, <br/>
this box may be more accessible than usual. Might be worth looking into for <br/>
those already thinking about coming to the gathering...</div>
