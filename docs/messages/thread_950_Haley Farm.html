were looking for.  Haley Farm Cemetery log book is full and the back<br/>
of the pages are now being used.  Picnic Spot stamp is still missing,<br/>
but what a great spot for a box.  Re-hid HF State Park box better<br/>
that we found it.  Could be seen from the trail approaching it.  kocR<br/>
yponaC was in fine shape as were both of the Safety Wise Series.<br/>
<br/>
Finished placing the Gilbert &amp; Sullivan series in Simsbury yesterday<br/>
and now we are off for a 2-week vacation but not letterboxing because<br/>
we are traveling with a group.  Will have a lot of catching-up to do<br/>
when we return.<br/>
