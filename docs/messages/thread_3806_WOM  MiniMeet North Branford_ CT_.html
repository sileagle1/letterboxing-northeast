&lt;&lt;   "CALLING ALL LETTERBOXERS!<br/>
NOT A LETTERBOXER? NEVER HEARD OF LETTERBOXING?<br/>
<br/>
WE'RE CALLING YOU, TOO!<br/>
<br/>
Thursday, June 5, 2008<br/>
North Branford Senior Center  1675 Foxon Road, North Branford, CT<br/>
10:30 A.M.<br/>
<br/>
If you are already a "Letterboxer" we want you to come to <br/>
this "GATHERING!" We are calling it a "MiniMeet" and a new box will <br/>
be inaugurated that day. Come as early as 9:00 A.M. and enjoy <br/>
coffee "and" while exchanging and be helpful showing noxers why you <br/>
love this hobby! <br/>
<br/>
If you have never heard of "Letterboxing" but enjoy learning new <br/>
things, we want you to come and find out about this intriguing hobby <br/>
combining artistic ability with delightful "treasure-hunts." You may <br/>
discover beautiful scenic places close by that you didn't know <br/>
existed! You will be led to fascinating gift shops, restaurants, <br/>
libraries, museums and more The program is scheduled for 10:30 but <br/>
things will begin happening at 9:00 if you can arrive that early. <br/>
<br/>
Lunch may be reserved by calling ahead (203) 315-6017 and is only <br/>
$2.00. Feel free to bring a brown bag lunch if you prefer. <br/>
Coffee "and" is included in the lunch fee, or available for 50cents <br/>
without lunch."   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is limited parking at the Sr. Center -- but there is more <br/>
parking across the street at the Congregational Church.<br/>
This event is WOM but the new box will be posted on AQ and LbNA. <br/>
Watch for it!<br/>
