                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-530038184">I know this posting is a little late involving the controversy of <br/>
keeping letterboxing restricted-and I will admit that we never planted <br/>
one of our own boxes,so I don't know how I would feel if our boxes got <br/>
trashed. But reading that letterboxers want to go "underground" with <br/>
their clues &amp; basically restricting who has access to the clues is very <br/>
sad. The hobby has grown because of the media-and like everything else <br/>
that the media reports on, there is a flurry of interest &amp; then it goes <br/>
away. People eventually are going to get tired of hiking in the woods <br/>
for the sole purpose of trashing a rubbermaid container. Letterboxing <br/>
(&amp; geocaching)has introduced so many people to out-of-the way trails &amp; <br/>
areas that no one would have known about. We have discovered so many <br/>
trails that we never knew existed &amp; it is a great great hobby. Now that <br/>
winter is approaching there is a good chance that a lot of boxes won't <br/>
be disturbed in the snow &amp; by next spring this will be forgotten by the <br/>
few who would like to vandalize the boxes. Only a thought-but felt I <br/>
needed to say it.</div>
