someones book that they use to stamp in. We didn't want to leave it on <br/>

planter about a possible lost log book and she told me it was her <br/>
daughters. She retrieved it in fine shape this morning and asked me to <br/>
extend a great big Thank You to the finders. So Thank You Sandy and <br/>
Bob :-)<br/>
