                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-964065428">Hey all!  I went out to do the the "End of the Trail" letterbox in Falls Village yesterday.  It was terrific!  Near the trailhead is an amazing waterfalls!  Since this has been a "moist" October, the waterfall  is really gushing!  The hike along the Mohawk Trail itself was great...so much to see.  The AMC hut served as a good rest area, alhough I found a smoldering campfire nearby. Thank you to the End Gang for a great rainy autumn adventure!  (You are right, it is scenic in autumn.)<br/>
<br/>
PS...if anyone knows, does the Mohawk Trail pass through Dudleytown?  It's been about 5 years since I explored that area...very mysterious spot.<br/>

I thought that all of Dudleytown was private property, surrounded by private <br/>
property at this point.<br/>

But I heard that Indian Wells State Park backs up to it also?</div>

The funny thing is, some old friends of an aunt and uncle of mine once lived next to the area.  They told me that it was basically in their backyard.  I do recall, about 6 years ago finding an old shovel near one of the old foundations there.<br/>
<br/>
I think Indian Wells Park is in Shelton, maybe there is a different one?<br/>
Happy trials,<br/>
