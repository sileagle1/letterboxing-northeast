to protect Hikerlou.  You're a man of action, even though you had to play the <br/>
bad guy.  I really wish that we had heard from HikerLou's parents regarding <br/>
this whole mess.  13 is still young and sometimes in need of guidance and <br/>
protection.  (aren't we all?)  The internet can be a dangerous place.  Htas off to <br/>
Brian for doing the right thing in a tight spot.<br/>
