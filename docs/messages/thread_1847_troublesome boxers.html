Not sure if anyone will ge this... I'm sorry I didn't do it up sooner. I'll <br/>
bring some copies of it tomorrow. :)<br/>
<br/>
From Bartlett Brook, we're going to Pioneers in Lebanon. Turn left onto <br/>
Goshen Hill Road, and right onto route 16 north. The Exeter Cemetery is near this <br/>
intersection (Pioneers in Lebanon).<br/>
<br/>
After Pioneers in Lebanon, go east onto route 207. Keep an eye out on the <br/>
left for the "Hidden Cemetery" which is actually called Center Cemetery. This <br/>
is where we will find the Hidden Cemetery series and Baby D Turns 2.<br/>
<br/>
Following this box, we'll go back on 207 West and turn left into the parking <br/>
lot ofr Lebanon High School. We'll cross the street on foot to go to Blue <br/>
Goose in the Town Pound. (Just trust me on this order.)<br/>
<br/>
Following that, we'll get back into our cars and go out onto 207 west and <br/>
then turn right onto Mack Road, and pull into the soccer field parking lot. This <br/>
is the location for Lebanon Lions.<br/>
<br/>
We'll get back onto Mack Road and keep going in the direction we were headed <br/>
in, and then turn right onto Barker Road. At the intersection wth 207, we'll <br/>
take a left and head east. When we see the sign for the French Soldier's <br/>
grave we'll park and do Baby D Turns 1.<br/>
<br/>
From here, we'll continue on 207 east and turn right when we get to the <br/>
center of town. We'll go right onto West Town Street and enter the Lebanon Green <br/>
Market and get Tymfurkoffi.<br/>
<br/>
From here, Flutterby can direct us to the best parking area for the boxes on <br/>
the Green (Lebanon Loop 1, Red Brick Meeting House, A Night on Lebanon Green), <br/>
since she's a local and knows where to park there if church is in session. :)<br/>
<br/>
Following the boxes on the Green, we'll head down West Town Street and join <br/>
up with Trumbull Road. Turn right onto Goshen Hill Road. Pull into the last <br/>
driveway of the Fire/Safety Complex and park on the right side of the building. <br/>
This is where we'll find Local Heroes.<br/>
<br/>
After this, we'll go back up Trumbull Road toward the center of town and make <br/>
a right onto Exeter Road. We'll pull into Lebanon Elementary on the right <br/>
and do My First Love. <br/>
<br/>
Then we'll get back onto Exeter Road and go to the bottom of the hill and <br/>
park in front of the Trumbull Cemetery on the left. This is the parking spot for <br/>
both Lebanon Loop 2 and Pot O' Gold.<br/>
<br/>
After these boxes we'll head in the same direction on Exeter Road and make a <br/>
left onto Kick Hill Road. At the stop sign, go straight at the intersection <br/>
of Babcock Hill Road. Take the next left onto Chappel Road, and a quick right <br/>
onto Bogg Lane (about 1.3 miles from the cemetery). Less than 1/10th of a mile <br/>
on Bogg Lane, pull over on the left in between a barbed wire fence and a large <br/>
tree. Pull out your Lebanon Loop clues for box #3!<br/>
<br/>
Now Head back off Bogg Lane the way you came and take a right onto Chappel <br/>
Road. Follow it to the end. Take a right onto 289. Follow for 2.4 miles. After <br/>
you pass the small plaza on the left, take the next left onto Village Hill <br/>
Road. Go down a half mile on Village Hill Road. The park is on the right, and <br/>
it���s pretty obscure if you���re not looking for it. If you reach Krause Road on the <br/>
left, you���ve gone too far! Turn around and go back, the park is easier to <br/>
spot coming from this direction. This park is the location of Lebanon Loop #4 <br/>
and Bear Tracks.<br/>
<br/>
Following this, we'll keep headin gnorth on Village Hill Road. Turn left <br/>
onto Cook Hill Road. Scovell Cemetery will be on your right. This is where we'll <br/>
look for the Castle of Scovell.<br/>
<br/>
Now we'll head to our final destination. Continue on Cook Hill Road until <br/>
the intersection with Route 87. Take 87 south (or is it east?), and on the left <br/>
will be Liberty Hill Cemetery. This is the location of Gray of Liberty Hill.<br/>
<br/>
And I believe that will do it! I'm pretty optimistic that we'll be able to <br/>
hit most, if not all, of these. It's a short way from box to box, since <br/>
they're all in the same town, and they're all drive-bys. <br/>
<br/>
Special thanks to Flutterby. :) And to Queen B, since I cut and pasted some <br/>
of her driving directions off her clues. :)<br/>
<br/>
See you tomorrow at 9!<br/>

Just a quick thanks to Chrissy (aka Brandy You're a Fine Girl) for <br/>
organizing this event. Sorry that you could not make it due to <br/>
illness - we missed you. Goalie Girl and I did end up going after <br/>
all for a little while. Had to scoot out early to run errands and <br/>
get home to put my house back together (we painted and had carpets <br/>
cleaned this week so many things out of place). But we managed to <br/>
get 15 boxes by lunchtime and some exchanges plus the event stamp. <br/>
It was so nice to see some familiar faces again and to meet some new <br/>
trail friends as well. A BIG THANK YOU to Flutterby's husband for <br/>
getting my van unstuck in the parking lot. It doesn't do well in <br/>
the snow (and there was ice under the snow). Thanks also to Music <br/>
Woman for keeping us organized in Chrissy's place. This was my <br/>
first time boxing in the winter. IT can be pretty tricky finding <br/>
some of the locations under the snow. <br/>
<br/>
Take care. When is the SPRING boxing drive?????<br/>

We decided at 7:45 this morning to go to the Winter Boxing Drive today! We quickly rushed to get dressed an gather all necessary paraphenalia (which isn't always so quick with Mr. Safety around!) and stopped at Dunkin Donuts for coffee and breakfast!<br/>
<br/>
This was our first gathering, and since starting boxing last June we have only met 3 people while boxing, so it was nice to finally put faces to names! We enjoyed ourselves very much and it was a pleasure to meet all of you!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to Flutterby and her family for welcoming us all into her home. Chrissy did a great job coordinating and Music Woman was so wonderful at keeping things going! Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
We left the group after leaving Flutterby's house (our journal LOADED with exchanges!), as we already had the next few on teh 'to do' list. We headed over to Lebanon Lions Soccer and were pleasently surprised! Thanks Queen B.<br/>
<br/>
As we headed out of town on our way home, we stopped at the Exeter Cemetery for a Hot Cocoa break and snack. A State Police Officer pulled up along side us and asked if we were the "Mischevious Geo Cachers". We politely said, '"No, letterboxers, but why?" Apparently we had stirred suspision from a nearby neighbor while boxing in a tiny little spot not far from Queen B's house!!! The neighbor had described our car and he found us! He checked out the area where we had been snooping, found the box and left his "Hello from the State Police" in the log book! We explained letterboxing and that tohers might be around this afternoon, in case he got more calls! Too Funny!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, we are such a delinquent little group!<br/>
<br/>
