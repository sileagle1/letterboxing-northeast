I was wondering who is going to the Maine gathering that is coming <br/>
up, and how many are bringing travellers. I'd like to get as many <br/>
traveller stamps as possible seeing as this will be my first event. I <br/>
am going to try and bring a traveller as well, and will post it on <br/>
here when I do. I'm so excited!!<br/>
