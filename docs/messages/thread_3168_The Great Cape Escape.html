Trustees of Reservations. In their most recent "Special Places"  <br/>
newsletter, they have an article about Questing. Basically a VERY  <br/>
EDUCATIONAL letterboxing experience. They have a virtual one at:<br/>
<br/>
www.vitalcommunities.org/valleyquest/virtualquest.htm<br/>
<br/>
plus more info about questing, which I have heard of but thought it  <br/>
was an early version of letterboxing in the US. I guess not.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, in the newsletter is a quest in RAVENSWOOD PARK in  <br/>
Gloucester, MA; MENEMSHA HILLS RESERVATION, Chilmark, Martha's  <br/>
Vineyard; THE TRUSTEES OFFICE at 193  High St, Holyoke, MA; and  <br/>
BARTHOLOMEW'S COBBLE, Sheffield, MA. All the clues are available  <br/>
either on the bulletin board at a kisosk (Ravenswood, Menemsha), at  <br/>
the office (Holyoke), or at the visitor's center (Sheffield).  The  <br/>
hikes range from 1.5 hours to 3 hours. At the end I THINK is a hand- <br/>
carved stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Also, they have one planned at APPLETON  FARMS, Hamilton, MA, (my  <br/>
GREEN DOGS letterbox is there as well . . . I hope they don't get rid  <br/>
of it). I don't know when that will be ready.<br/>
<br/>
I'll have to try the 2 hour Gloucester one sometime.<br/>
<br/>
Check out their web site for a bunch of other quests in the VT and NH  <br/>
areas.<br/>
<br/>
thought you all would like to know . . . if you didn't already . . .  <br/>
Anybody did any Questing before?<br/>

Steve Glaser, director of Valley Quests has sent us some test quests to try<br/>

test run clues for other boxers.<br/>

There are 13 boxes and they will be planted along the Monoosnoc Ridge Trail.  I recently gave a letterboxing informational talk to 26 elementary school teachers and the quest will be listed in the Leominster Recreational Department brochure that is given to all the schoolchildren in the city.  The quest runs from Oct. 1st to July 1st ,2007. Anyone who shows proof of completing the quest will receive a patch.<br/>

It was started around 1987 after David Sobel discovered letterboxing while on sabbatical in England and decided to use the idea for educational purposes. Their quests are in the Upper Connecticut River Valley region of Vermont and New Hampshire.<br/>
