I know how hard that feels.  You are wise to not to replace it in its <br/>
current location now that you know that it is a "party place".<br/>
<br/>
If you ever want to form a posse of disgruntled letterboxers who lost <br/>
precious boxes to "partiers", count me in!  I know of more than a few <br/>
choice locations where letterboxes have disappeared without a trace - <br/>
except for the empty beer bottles!<br/>
