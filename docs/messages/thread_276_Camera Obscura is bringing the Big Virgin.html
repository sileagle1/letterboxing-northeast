distributing clues for my new Boston letterbox, The Big Virgin <br/>
Sunday at POE. This being my first gathering, I want to give my <br/>
fellow attendees a treat, so this clue release is exclusive to the <br/>
gathering. I won't be posting the clues to the LBNA site until <br/>
someone from POE gets first finders. This is the first LB I have <br/>
planted in New England, and only the second in all, but I am very <br/>
happy with the stamp and the box in general. On a grimmer note, <br/>
I'm not sure what I will be bringing for food, but it probably will<br/>
be <br/>
not so special because I will be on the road with the lovely <br/>
Amymisha boxing on Saturday, rather than at home cooking. In <br/>
any event, I can't wait to meet you all soon!!</div>
