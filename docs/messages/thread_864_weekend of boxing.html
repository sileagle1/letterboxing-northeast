If you are laughing at the spelling of Hillsborough, that is the way<br/>
it is written on letterboxes placed by rtrw who grew up there.  I<br/>
always thought it was Hillsboro since I grew up in the area but was<br/>
too tired to even get out the map and check when I posted.<br/>
<br/>
We often spend time in NH because that is where I grew up.  We were<br/>
in CT on Sat., in VT on our way to NH on Sun. and Mon.  Home on Tue. <br/>
Great days for boxing!<br/>

original message.  It said "Weedend" of boxing.  I missed it the <br/>
first time.  As for Hillsboro, I see it spelled both ways but think <br/>
borough is the official or original spelling.<br/>
