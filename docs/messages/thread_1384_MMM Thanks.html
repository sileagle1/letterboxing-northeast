screwy and erased it...*sigh*<br/>
<br/>
Anyways - thanks to EVERYONE: the hosts and helpers, the letterbox <br/>
makers, and of course, the attendees.  Without these three elements <br/>
the event couldn't have been what it was yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
With the association of the Monster Mash, I came away with a <br/>
productive 1 plant, 29 finds and 35 exchanges!<br/>
<br/>
I can't wait to make it back out there on another October weekend to <br/>
hopefully find a few more.<br/>
<br/>
We got there around 12pm - and stamped into our last box around <br/>
7:30pm in the pitch dark of the forest!<br/>
<br/>
We had a lot of fun - I hope to see a second MMM, maybe, next year? <br/>
Hahaha...<br/>
