While on a lunch break I checked on the ART IN THE PARK (#1) box....<br/>
The box was in tact, however here's what was inside.<br/>
Scrawled on a yellow post-it note in terrible handwriting (and un-forgivable spelling) was <br/>
the following death threat:<br/>
<br/>
Quote:<br/>
Read me <br/>
"If someone doesn't git rid of this box I'll kill you!"<br/>
End Quote<br/>
<br/>
hmmmmm.....<br/>
by the way, don't go looking for art in the park anytime soon....it's too close to nearby <br/>
raging flood waters (hint hint!!)<br/>

is that phyto: death threat or Maine: death threat?  ;oP<br/>

Wow, that beats my note about someone hoping one of my boxes was a weed <br/>

</span></blockquote>Yup, I was pretty surprised. First of all because the hiding spot was<br/>
just obscure. These kids must have been very bored and/or drunk or<br/>
something (!) They clearly liked the idea, took the stamp and the<br/>
logbook, but left the box in tact and went to the trouble of placing a<br/>
hand-written post it note in the box. <br/>
<br/>
Ah well....<br/>
There's a first for everything. I figure that at least it's<br/>
(hopefully) harmless pranksters that have no clue. If I were a trial<br/>
lawyer, it would probably have been a real death threat by now. Note:<br/>
I decided long ago not to go in the law profession. (My mother thanks me)<br/>

Well, Maine winters are long and sometimes hanging out at the park<br/>
drinking Allen's Coffee Br=andy and messing with other people's<br/>
letterboxes is the pinnacle of fun in February. I know Dave and I<br/>
spent many a weekend doing that here on MDI (just kidding!!!)<br/>
