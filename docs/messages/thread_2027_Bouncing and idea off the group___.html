<br/>
I'd like to bounce an idea off you all.<br/>
<br/>
I have been approached by a local historical society who is planning<br/>
their annual fundraiser home tour.  The proceeds of the tour help<br/>
support the preservation efforts for a Newburgh, NY Revolutionary War<br/>
era home.  This year they are interested in doing something a little<br/>
different to entice "new blood" to visit the historic homes and have<br/>
asked me to conduct a road rally style event.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of the details which are still in a VERY rough form.<br/>
<br/>
Number of stops: 6 definitely, possibly 10<br/>
Event only stamps<br/>
You must attend the brief tour of the home to obtain access/directions<br/>
to the box which will be on the property.<br/>
As it is a fundraiser, there will be a fee of approximately $25 which<br/>
covers the tours for all the homes and the souvenir book.<br/>
Date: Sunday 12 June 2005<br/>
<br/>
I have discussed with the person trying to organize this event my<br/>
thoughts. One of the appeals of letterboxing it that it is a low<br/>
cost/free hobby for the finders (I've tried to convince Lascivious<br/>
Lion/Box Hound that it's free, but he yain't buyin' it).  And that I<br/>
wasn't sure how well that would translate into an "event" for<br/>
letterboxing.  While I love the idea, I think $25 would be prohibitive<br/>
for many.  It does however; cover the whole family so that might be a<br/>
bonus.<br/>
<br/>
If you all have any suggestions or tweaks that you think might make this<br/>
possibly happen, I'd love to hear your input.  Thanks for your time.  <br/>
<br/>
Patiently awaiting your input,<br/>

<br/>
I feel it is OK to use the letterboxing hobby to promote a non-<br/>
profit / chartiable organization.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few boxes that require an expense to obtain, such as a <br/>
park entry fee, so that is not unprecedented.  I'm sure that the <br/>
clues will say that this is a fundraiser and what the cost is.  <br/>
People can decide if they want to support the cause or not.<br/>
<br/>
If they don't want to incurr the cost, there are many other <br/>
letterboxes too.<br/>
<br/>
This is my first impression, for what it is worth.<br/>
