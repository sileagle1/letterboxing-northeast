<br/>
Well, wish I could say that I broke my own record for finding the most boxes in one day, but alas - that is not the case.  We broke the record for finding the most snakes and the longest on the trails at Rocky Neck state park!  First we say a 12 inch garter, next about a 15 inch garter.  On the blue trail, we say a 3 foot black snake.  Then we say a 4 foot  (plus) dark colored snake with faded markings.  This one made a noise to let us know he was there.  It was very similar to a rattle, but we don't think it was a rattler - maybe it just hissed.  All I know is we were quite happy to get back to the truck and get on our bikes!<br/>
<br/>
Stay safe and Enjoy!<br/>
