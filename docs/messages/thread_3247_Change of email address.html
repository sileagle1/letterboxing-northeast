                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-938048838">My apologies if anyone has tried to contact us and hasn't gotten a <br/>
reply.  All of my Yahoo groups mail has bounced and therefore, Yahoo <br/>
stopped sending it to my Team Safari mailbox at msn.  I think it had <br/>
to do with not being able to take "parental controls" off the msn <br/>
account.  I thought it was awfully quite for a few days.<br/>
<br/>
Now we have a new MSN address and it's TeamSafariRI at MSN dot com.  <br/>
It will take a while to reconfigure everything.<br/>
