This may be asking too much, but is there anyone who will be attending the Flamingo Caper on Oct. 1st who can get the 2-packs of spiral bound index cards for $1 and would be willing to bring them to the gathering for me? I have checked all the dollar stores in my area as well as many I have passed in other states and I can't locate them.  I would take up to $20 worth (20 packs of 2).  If this is asking too much, sorry.<br/>
