<br/>
  I had a fun time deciphering the clues. Didn't come close to winning, but had a great time!! <br/>
<br/>
  The letterbox series at the end was comprised of some awesome carvings!!!<br/>
<br/>
  The weather was perfect too!<br/>
<br/>
  I hope this will be an annual event. <br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for all of your hard work Brandy. <br/>
<br/>
  Also, thanks to all of the carvers. You did an awesome job. <br/>
