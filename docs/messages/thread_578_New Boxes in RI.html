(probably got bronchitis while boxing last week in the pouring <br/>
rain).  So, instead of going further afield for hiking or letterboxing <br/>
adventures as originally planned, I've been staying close to <br/>
home and doing some more local planting.  The other day I went <br/>
out with Laurette (who recently reached PFX 500 in New Mexico <br/>
 Congrats!) to put in a new series of 3 "Hungry Rocks" as an <br/>
add-on to "Dad's Birthday Box" in Exeter, RI.  We also did an on-<br/>
the-spot replacement of "One More Little Feather" while we were <br/>
out that way!  Then, the next day, since I was out doing my <br/>
annual "arbutus sniffing walk" at Kimball Audubon Sanctuary,  I <br/>
though I might as well put out the "Trailing Arbutus" box in a new <br/>
location this time just over the border in Burlingame, as had <br/>
been suggested by the Audubon refuge chairman.  Hope those <br/>
of you who didn't have a chance to get that one before can now <br/>
find it in its new temporary home.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm also working on several other series that should be coming <br/>
out soon, as I'm making an effort to try to get to P100 before <br/>
reaching PFX 5000!  That should be happening sometime within <br/>
the next month or so, but probably not in CT  I just did an <br/>
update of my box counts for all the individual states we've visited, <br/>
so far, and found that my F count for CT alone is now over 2000!  <br/>
That still represents well under half the total number of boxes <br/>
that I've found including 30 other states, but  WOWEE CT!!!  <br/>
Even at the rate they're still coming out over in CT, I don't think <br/>
there could even be enough left there for me to find to get me to <br/>
PFX 5000 right now.  I guess that means we'll have to be <br/>
planning a trip to ME, PA or somewhere else sometime soon.  <br/>
Thanks again to all you planters everywhere!   Glad to see this <br/>
hobby of ours growing by leaps and bounds!<br/>
