                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-696250338">Hi everyone!  I'm doing ok.  I was out of work on Monday and only worked a half day on Tuesday.  Wednesday was my first full day back at work, and the kids were scheduled to paint didjeridus and flags for our World Music concert.  So needless to say, this required a lot of climbing and set up for me yesterday.  I was doing fine until I had to mount string on my ceiling to hang the painted stuff with clothes pins.  That was really hard, and by the time I got into the car, I could barely move.  Since I had a lower back injury, near my tailbone, even sitting in the car is painful.  I now have a pillow to sit on, even in my cushy rental car.  Today's my first day of Band, which will require lots of moving of my arms and legs.  We'll see how I feel afterwards!  The appraiser went to see my car yesterday, and will call me back again today.  Brendon (my tow truck driving brother) says the car is totaled due to the buckle in the roof.  I guess this means that the frame has been bent, which I don't think can be fixed.  Thankfully, if this is true, my dad (dad offered... mom didn't refuse) has already offered me my mother's VW, and said that he wanted mom to get a new car anyway.  I'm not sure if he went through Mom on this first.... but that's not my problem!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your prayers and support!  We greatly appreciate it!  I talked to Kelli yesterday.  She's in a lot of pain, but doing ok.  We talked little about the accident and more about letterboxing!  Needless to say, I will not be hiking anytime soon, but I WILL be letterboxing in South Carolina this weekend (though Peter is upset that he hasn't found a letterbox FREE vacation spot for us yet... LOL).<br/>

Just thought I would get on the computer and say hello!  It has been <br/>
between 68-72 degrees for the last couple of days.  Today is sunny <br/>
and 78 degrees!! Woo Hoo!  I found a couple of boxes down here, <br/>
pulled two for another letterboxer who I had contacted before coming <br/>
down, and hope to plant a micro today.  Yesterday, we took a day off <br/>
from boxing and went to Savannah.  The squares that are in the city <br/>

townhouse in historical Savannah!!!!!!  We had lunch at Paula Deen's <br/>
restaurant "Lady and Sons."  It was <br/>
FAAAABBBUUUULLLLLOOOOOUUUUUUSSSS!  Oh do I love southern cooking!!! <br/>
BTW... Paula Deen is a woman who lives in Savannah who has a show on <br/>
the Food Network.  I just HAVE to get her cookbooks now!  Most of the <br/>
food in her restaurant is in her cookbooks.... off to Amazon.com!<br/>
<br/>
Off to shop today before heading home tomorrow.  Don't take this <br/>
