If you're looking for something to do on October 28, you may want to go to <br/>
Cedar Hill Cemetery. :)  It's on the Wethersfield/Hartford border and they're <br/>
having a flashlight tour from 7-9.  It's not the scary "haunted graveyard" type. <br/>
 It's with tour guides who walk you around from grave to grave where you meet <br/>
actors dressed as prominent "citizens" of Cedar Hill.  Guess who will be <br/>
portrying Mrs. Horace Wells? <br/>
<br/>
I was also given permission for a day-only letterbox.  Details on that to <br/>
follow. :)<br/>
