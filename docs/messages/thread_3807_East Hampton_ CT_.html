WE [ SHE ]  really looked hard for that Jack !!!  must admit , we did NOT look for just a box ,  the Jack being our focus .!!  Now a good reason to go back , beside , I have to climb Bald Mt again ,  It was too hot and sunny when we were there , and I could not make that last little push to the box .  With the other new boxes out on that trail , perhaps I can talk Donna into going back with me .  She did get M/W's and brought me a stamp image , but I need to do it myself  and stamp in .. <br/>
