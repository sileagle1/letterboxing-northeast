<br/>
I just noticed that the photos section is over our quota and Yahoo <br/>
Groups is complaining about that. If there are any old photos that are <br/>
no longer necessary of yours, please delete them to make room for <br/>
others!<br/>
<br/>
On another note, you can also list photos on Atlas Quest where there's <br/>
essentially no quota. (Okay, there is a "limit" of somewhere around <br/>
one million photos, but I think it's safe to say that won't be reached <br/>
anytime soon!) So if the Photos section here refuses to allow anymore <br/>
photos to be uploaded, AQ is an option. <br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>
