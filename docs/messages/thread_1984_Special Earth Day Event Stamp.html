activities this Saturday April 23rd.<br/>
<br/>
In honor of this I have carved a special event stamp that was <br/>
designed by one of the scouts.<br/>
It is very easy to receive this stamp.<br/>
All you need to do is:<br/>
come to the Lebanon Green near the library<br/>
on Saturday between 8-2<br/>
go to the information tent and ask for the box<br/>
in order to get it you have to say what you have done to help the <br/>
Earth<br/>
(this could be many things planting, cleaning, picking up trash <br/>
etc...)<br/>
<br/>
There will be many other things going on as well<br/>
D.E.P. interactive displays<br/>
free trees for planting<br/>
a limited amount of free bluebird houses<br/>
butterfly feeders<br/>
a plant sale<br/>
hot dogs/chips/soda for sale<br/>
<br/>
There are also A LOT of boxes in the town of Lebanon. Many of which <br/>
are drive bys. I will also have a limited amount of clue sheets to a <br/>
WOM set of boxes in town.<br/>
<br/>
I hope some of you can make it.<br/>
