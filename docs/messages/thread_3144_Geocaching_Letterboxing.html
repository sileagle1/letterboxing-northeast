 I work in Groton and you should really walk Bluff point!!! It is a <br/>
beautiful walk and I believe 3.5 miles. There are some terrific <br/>
views from there!!!!!!!!!!! Also boxes along the way ;) wink wink...<br/>
Depending on if you box early in the morning or not I could meet <br/>
you. I work 3rd shift so prime time for me is in the AM.<br/>

I just wish both sites explained the diffences to new people.<br/>
I can tell you without having a GPS or reading the clues, that i know<br/>
where most of the geocashing sites are in Franconia Notch and<br/>
kancagamgus Highway in NH. NH is small, and wish i could meet some<br/>
geocashers in the area, seem to be overlapping boxs</div>
