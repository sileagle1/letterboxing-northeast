Mansfield!  We want to tell everyone we met on the trails and in the <br/>

It's fun to put faces to names you know so well from the chat <br/>

All in all, a terrific visit. Thanks, Everyone.<br/>

<br/>
It was nice meeting you too!  Yes, we did cross the stream the same <br/>
way you did.  We did it without mishap, which is a miracle, given my <br/>
balance (or lack of it)!  Those of you who went to the boxes at <br/>
Sunny Acres Park last weekend know that the stream was a little <br/>
full...<br/>
