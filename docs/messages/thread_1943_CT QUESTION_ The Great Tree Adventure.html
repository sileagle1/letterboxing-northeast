<br/>
My wife (ct_Sunflowergirl) and I will be taking by wife's cousin <br/>
(lizzie lover) and her aunt (aunt sue) and uncle (the bronx bomber) <br/>
out letterboxing on Sunday afternoon in Wallingford at the Tyler Mill <br/>
Open Space.  I was wondering if anyone knew of the status of the boxes <br/>
hidden there.  My wife and I have been scrapbooking the stamps for her <br/>
cousin and we would like to try and create the pages before we go.  If <br/>
anyone has any information please reply as soon as possible.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested in meeting some new letterboxers (and getting <br/>
5 exchanges), I will post what time on Sunday we plan on being at <br/>
Tyler Mill, sometime later this weekend.  I would love to make some <br/>
new exchanges or meet up with some old friends.<br/>
<br/>
I hope all is well in your neck of the woods!<br/>
Safe Letterboxing!<br/>

So nice to see a post from you.  Those boxes are mine-- over three years <br/>
old and as far as I know are still there.  I checked this winter and all <br/>
was well .  I would like to meet you and do a spring check with some new <br/>
log books and possibly baggies.  Plus meet you again and your new <br/>
additions.!!   Let me know the time  and I will try to be there , or <br/>
catch you on the trail<br/>

Letterboxer2002, CT_Sunflowergirl, Lizzie Lover, Aunt Sue, and The <br/>
Bronx Bomber are going to head to Tyler Mills Open Space in <br/>
Wallingford, CT for 1:00.  Anyone who would like to meet up with us <br/>
should find us on the trail.  I am very excited for Kate to run up to <br/>
other hikers and ask if they are letterboxers.  She is going to love <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to see you there!<br/>
