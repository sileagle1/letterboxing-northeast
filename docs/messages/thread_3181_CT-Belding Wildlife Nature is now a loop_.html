Wildlife Nature Preserve so that the hike is now a loop.  It is such a <br/>
pretty area that I hope all of you who have already visited will visit <br/>
again to get the other half of the loop!  If you read the clues <br/>
carefully, I am sure you can figure out how to do just the part of the <br/>
hike that I added boxes. <br/>
