Thanks to Sadie and Russ and Donutz who scoured the cave looking for the original, which we were pretty sure was missing in the first place..... and thanks to Sadie and Russ who helped me overcome my fear of snakes and such (no fear of bears here!) to get into the cave to help plant the box!<br/>

Bluebird and Butterfly looked and rooted us on from OUTSIDE the cave ;-)<br/>

What fun!<br/>

but to my utter amazement, Sadie and Russ, Donutz and Music Woman were <br/>
ALL in there at once,  and standing up walking around !!!  I could NOT <br/>
go in because someone had my flashlight !!! :-) They all had smiles on <br/>
their faces when they slithered out ,  the hike was great and satisfied <br/>
me .<br/>
