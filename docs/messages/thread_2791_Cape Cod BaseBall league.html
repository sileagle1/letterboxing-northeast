<br/>
The Chatham A's box will be replaced later this week.....(thursday)<br/>
<br/>
And just to let everyone know this series of 10 boxes will most likely <br/>
be retired as of October 1st 2006 So get this series while you can.<br/>

Thank you for all the finder so far.<br/>

This is my ALL-TIME Favorite series.  It is well done in EVERY <br/>
aspect.  It is worth every second.  I completed it in two days.<br/>
TRULY a WONDERFUL series for anyone, but a CAN'T MISS for sports and <br/>
baseball fans.  GET THIS ONE DONE BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!!!!!!!!<br/>
