<br/>
  Unfortunately, the small wolf print stamp has not been found. My daughter and I combed the area for quite a bit and when I place the next box my husband and I will look again.  <br/>
<br/>
  If anyone should happen to come across the small marble statue with a wolf paw print attached, please let me know so that I can get it back to its owner.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks,<br/>
Flutterby~ <br/>
