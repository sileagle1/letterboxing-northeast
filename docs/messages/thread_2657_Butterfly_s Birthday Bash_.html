Mark, you are a wonderful writer-- I was there, and still I laughed at <br/>
your report  and lived it all over again. The excitement level was over <br/>
the top.  Thanks to all for an unforgettable memory.  My grandson just <br/>
sent me a note from Hawaii saying how happy he was that I have so many <br/>
wonderful friends. - he said it right,  I do.  As I said at the party-  <br/>
just look at each other and know that this leterboxing group  is a <br/>
family of caring friends. Always there for you , they help when you are <br/>
sad, heal when you are hurt and party like no tomorrow when you are <br/>
happy !!<br/>
I count these blessings everyday.<br/>
Happy Trails<br/>
Butterfly<br/>

B'fly is a good friend (and hostess) and I'm so happy she had many <br/>
