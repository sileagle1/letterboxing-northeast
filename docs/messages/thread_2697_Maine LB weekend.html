since I noticed recently some concern expressed by Phyto. I just <br/>
returned from spending a "girls' reunion weekend" with several my <br/>
family members in Bangor. Boy that place has changed alot over the <br/>
years...but I digress. We were looking for some things to do as a <br/>
group during Saturday, and rather than shopping, movies, etc.. I <br/>
suggested going to find a nearby letterbox. Just one. So five of us <br/>
went while two chose to stay back, still needing recovery time from <br/>
the previous evenings' festivities. We printed up the clues,(all of <br/>
the ones from Bangor area) then we went to do the Thomas Standpipe. <br/>
They're hooked. I couldn't make them stop. We skipped lunch and kept <br/>
going. Eventually I convinced them that we had to get back home to <br/>
the others. We did 5 boxes (I believe they were all Phyto's boxes and <br/>
they asked me to tell you kudos) They can't wait to make their own <br/>
stamps and logbooks and  to get out and do more. They're going to get <br/>
husbands involved,their kids.(all grown up geez)..etc... well some of <br/>
them will take to it, some won't. You know how it is. But we're from <br/>
all over the area. Carmel, Hermon, <br/>
Glendale,Belfast,Orrington,Bucksport and Corinth, just to name a few. <br/>
So anyways, I wanted to give you a heads up...  They are already <br/>
thinking of cool places to plant a few for you too!    Well, now that <br/>
the snow is coming, you may need to wait a little...  but anyways. We <br/>
had a great weekend. We're planning another similar event for the <br/>
summer in southern New England.  That's the news.  <br/>
See you on the trail.  K*</div>

<br/>
Yeah, to say that there isn't much happening north of Portland or the<br/>
mid-coast area is an understatement. I'm thrilled to hear that you<br/>
guys not only found some Bangor boxes, but that they had fun too.<br/>
Sometimes I get bummed out that nobody comes up here not to mention<br/>
that either a box is missing or there just aren't that many to bother<br/>
a trip all the way up here. Now that we're not even living close to<br/>
Bangor, I'd laugh if more folks started boxing there - the "if you<br/>
plant it...they will come" philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
We're an hour north of Bangor now, but you can be sure that Phyto and<br/>
Isosceles will be planting boxes this summer...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the update!<br/>
