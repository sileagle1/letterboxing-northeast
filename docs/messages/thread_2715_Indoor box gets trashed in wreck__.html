<br/>
I'm just posting to let everyone know that the "Enchantments <br/>
Letterbox" has been removed for a short time, due to the box getting <br/>
run over by a truck. <br/>
<br/>
Funny thing, it's an INDOOR BOX!!!! I posted a picture in the photos <br/>
section. This morning I was called to come to the store to help move <br/>
things because a truck drove through the side of the building. <br/>
<br/>
This was the one box I thought I would haven't have to worry about!!! <br/>
AND LOOK it gets crushed!! <br/>
<br/>
BUT luckily no one was hurt and no store stock was damaged. The <br/>
building has been closed by the town building inspector, and we still <br/>
don't know when we will be allowed back in. They are worried about <br/>
extreme structural damage. <br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I will be replacing the box soon. Check out the picture. <br/>

on our  way to find that box after the Manchester gathering. Unfortunately, we got lost <br/>
and it started raining so we headed home thinking we'd get back to it.<br/>
    Who ever thought it would get run over?!  I'm glad that no one got hurt but I feel bad for <br/>
your friend's store. At least your box now has an interesting story associated with it!!!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>
