You must give him a bag of "cookies" for energy and for being a good boy on the trails.  You might need a scooper and extra baggies if you take him on more urban adventures.  How about a cute bandana for his neck?  You could sew a LBNA or LBNE patch on it.  What kind of dog?  Do you think Diesel would like my daughter's malamute, Strider?  We'd love to go boxing with you sometime!<br/>

  Enjoy!<br/>

LOL, congrats on the "nephew"! :p<br/>
Seriously, consider a pair of boots to protect tender paws out on <br/>
the trail and in the woods.  Sharp stones are bad enough but I've <br/>
encountered broken glass, barbed-wire, rusted scraps of metal, et <br/>
c.  And yes I have had to bandage my dawg's feet more than once. :(<br/>
