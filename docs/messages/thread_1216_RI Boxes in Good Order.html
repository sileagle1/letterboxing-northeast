<br/>
Team Milagro was out this weekend for a quick set of three boxes - all in good <br/>
shape:<br/>
<br/>
Nockham Hill Turtle<br/>
Though we didn't see any turtles, there were many remnants of turtle egg <br/>
shells about. Very curious! The clues describe the box as located beneath the <br/>
bough of a particular branch, but we found the box actually at the base of the <br/>
tree against the trunk and replaced it where we found it. Enjoyed excellent <br/>
sweet corn from Four Town Farm later that night (the directions mentioned we <br/>
should visit, so we did!)<br/>
<br/>
North South Trail - Buck Hill<br/>
(Along with team Sock Monkey)<br/>
A nicely maintained rocky trail. The box was in the location described, dry and <br/>
well hidden. We found a tiny toad which our three year old named "Toady". <br/>
We then explained to her why exactly we couldn't take Toady home to live <br/>
with us...<br/>
<br/>
White Mill Park Letterbox<br/>
(Along with team Sock Monkey)<br/>
An easy find, nice location and plenty of nature to see along the way. Box was <br/>
dry and replaced securely.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the folks who placed these boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, <br/>
<br/>

thanks for the box report on North-South Trail Buck Hill.  I don't <br/>
get up the that corner of the state often.  I am glad to hear that <br/>
the box is in good condition.<br/>
