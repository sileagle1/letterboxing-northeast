From the Colonial Governor of New York<br/>
Dated 8 May 1698<br/>
<br/>
Dear Sirs,<br/>
<br/>
You had tasked my predecessor, Governor Fletcher, to eliminate the Pirates that plague the shores of New England but I find that those Pirates that have been given the greatest disturbance in the East Indies  and the Red Sea, have either been fitted out from New York or Rhode Island.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard that there will be a meeting of these villainous outlaws in November in Rhode Island.  Our efforts to limit their plundering and hanging those Outlaws that we can apprehend have been bearing Fruit.  My spies have informed me that several of these Pirates are planning to rendezvous to recruit more hands.<br/>
<br/>
I will endeavour to gather more information and keep you informed of my Efforts to eradicate this scourge to our Colonies.<br/>
<br/>
Your humble servant,<br/>
Richard Coote<br/>
Earl of Bellomont<br/>
Colonial Governor of New York<br/>

It is good to knew that you are still alive.  Heard rumors that you had been lynched by the King�s men.  I knew of the Place you speak.  I heard Tales of other Pirates stashing their loot in the area.  Maybe we can search the area to be rewarded with hidden Treasure.  I will meet you there next month on the day when the Moon is in its first quarter, an hour before Noon.  I will bring Sugar from the West Indies and other Delicacies to share with you.  It will be good to see you again, olde Friend.<br/>

I have had my Men search out the Villens that plunder our seas and rob our Merchants.

My dearest brother,<br/>
<br/>
I am concerned for the safety of my husband, Thom.  I fear that he is taking unsafe measures in meeting other former privateers in a few days.  I beseech you, please, go and protect him and make sure the Royal Guards to not capture him.  The new governor would like nothing more than to hang him as an example for others like him.  Contact me if you need to know where and when he will be meeting those scoundrels.<br/>
