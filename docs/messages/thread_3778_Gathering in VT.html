They have been running murder mysteries for years. They became interested in letterboxing and we got together with them. They are very enthusiastic and have found a way to encorporate letterboxing into the mysteries. Sue &amp; I are planning to attend the last one that they offer in August.

  Let us know what you think of the Mystery event. If it was a little less expensive somehow I think alot more people would sign up. <br/>
