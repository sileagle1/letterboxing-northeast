productive day! Perhaps I'll join in next time. Today I visited <br/>
Bailey's Ravine in Franklin, CT. Found all 5 of the wild animals <br/>
hidden there, plus Autumn Tradition 2, and the hitchhiker 40th <br/>
Birthday, the very same day it was hidden on Safari.  Yes, following <br/>
in the footsteps of Sadie, Russ and Bluebird did make my hunt quite <br/>
unchallenging :-) If you plan to visit here soon, please be aware <br/>
that the stream you must cross is very full and the last part of the <br/>
trail has a stream running down the middle of it so be sure to wear <br/>
your wellies.  Drewclan's 2 stamp series Bailey's Ravine is also here <br/>
so be sure to bring those clues.<br/>
