just got back from a nice day of letterboxing, albeit a cold one.<br/>
during the day my son and i released our very first hitchhiker. we<br/>
wanted to put it at the inn but found that it was removed for the<br/>
winter. as a long suffering red sox fan i was heartbroken again in<br/>
october when there just wasn't any relief to be found!!!!!! if grady<br/>
had only seen my hitchhiker he might have known how to spell relief.<br/>
happy hunting<br/>
