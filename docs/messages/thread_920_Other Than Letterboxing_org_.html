There are people who just prefer to keep their clues more secretive. This means <br/>
that you might get a set of clues handed to you at a gathering (by yours truly) or <br/>
you might get them mailed to you sometime. You never know when you might get <br/>
a precious gift of clues. Either way, I'm sure you're not going to run out of boxes to <br/>
keep you busy for a long time!<br/>

pulled off the site.  I know that he pulled the older ones off earlier this <br/>
year because he was going to retire them.  I doubt he's going to retire all of <br/>
them..... Hmmmmmm<br/>
<br/>
I did get down to Ground Zero and United We Stand today.  Couldn't find box 1 <br/>
of United We Stand (that doesn't mean it wasn't there!), but found all of the <br/>
others just fine.<br/>
<br/>
Almost couldn't find Popeye in NL today..... those bearings are a little off <br/>
for the Ledge Light and I think the monument, by about 10-20 degrees.  The <br/>
flag pole at the Fort is correct at 000 degrees.  I had such a hard time that I <br/>
had to call Bluebird at her house during her family cookout!  oops!  did I do <br/>
that???????<br/>
<br/>
As for Box 1 of Harkness Memorial Series.... I STILL couldn't couldn't get to <br/>
that box (ugh!!!!).  The park was closed today because it was full.  They <br/>
wouldn't even let me park for 5 minutes..... and I even have a Season Pass!  <br/>
Grumble Grumble..... ice cream at the new Coldstone Creamery in Waterford made me <br/>
feel better!!!!<br/>

Hiya! We're just having some computer problems ourselves, and since <br/>
our clues are on our own website we're trying to google-proof some of <br/>
them as well. Nothing earth shaking going on here. We do know that <br/>
some other clues have been temporarily unlisted in anticipation of <br/>
the Time Magazine article's release, which may be today. That, and <br/>
having some time over the weekend to work on the computer, is all <br/>
that's going on with us. No dark-side conspiracy, we promise!<br/>

Thanks for the reply.  I'm not familiar with all the details (Time <br/>
Magazine's article and how that affects the LbNA database), but can <br/>
you clear up one thing ... are you saying that the clues to your <br/>
boxes will be reposted on the LbNA database?  If so, might you know <br/>
the story with TeamGreenDragon's boxes?  Similar situation perhaps?  <br/>
We'd hate to lose both team's boxes!  Some of the best out there!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

&gt; that you might get a set of clues handed to you at a gathering (by <br/>
yours truly) or <br/>
&gt; you might get them mailed to you sometime. You never know when you <br/>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>Yes, that is correct. There are those that are lost to the old ways. <br/>
Primarily because the switchover to the "new" site involved removing graphic links <br/>
for clues. You'll find some particularly creative clues on the "old" site.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If so, how  does one distinguish between those that still exist and those that do <br/>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>Well, speaking from my personal experience - the ones in maine - ARE THERE. I <br/>
highly encourage new boxers to really take some time and research the history in <br/>
those old clues and boxes. That is only speaking for the ones in Maine placed by a <br/>
certain sleight of hand man. Those clues are worth every ounce of effort you'll go <br/>
through to find them - hunt them down! I say, the harder the clues are to find - the <br/>
better the boxes, and the greater the chance that the box actually survives in the <br/>
long run.<br/>
