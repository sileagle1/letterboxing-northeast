Tomorrow is the most important thing in life. Comes into us at midnight very clean. It's perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands. It hopes we've learned something from yesterday. <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1711171488">Dan and I went back to Mansfield yesterday, although later than we had planned (as usual).  We had an adventure.  We spent a LONNNG time trying to find the WOM box and gave up, until we found some old LB friends at the Vampire's trailhead at dusk who directed us a little better. So we went back in the dark and got it. :-)  <br/>
<br/>
We went to try the Vampire series and before we hit the trail (at dusk) I realized my set of keys were lost.  We had to abandon the hunt until we went back and found them at another stop, and then snagged the WOM box. Dan REALLY wanted those vampires, so we went back.  After going up the first incline and losing the white trail markers, we went back down to start over.  I talked Dan out of it, given the 2 false starts, and the terrain, and the slippery oak leaves, and my aching knee...  <br/>
<br/>
So we went instead to the Schoolhouse Park series, and got the 6 remaining ones there. (We didn't even try to look for the "Force" box because it was confirmed missing.)  Having wrapped up that walk by flashlight and lantern, we called it a night.  Too bad we missed out on so many boxes.  We took a roundabout way home to see the Haunted House in Putnam.  It was around 10:30 when we drove up but we wanted to see what we could from the outside.  We were not brave enough to knock at that hour! ;-)  It was creepy, kooky, and altogether ookie.  The inside must've been a scream.  Maybe next year we'll experience the terror...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this was, like, the best Halloween evah!  Boxing in the forest under the moon late into the night.  Very cool.  If we didn't have jobs and all that, we would have been out all night, and would have gone after the Vampires in the morning. :::sigh:::<br/>
<br/>
This was a wonderful event and I feel privileged to have seen so many outstanding stamps, logs, and boxes.  (My favorite all-around was Gollum.)  Thank you so, so much Chuck et al!!!!!! <br/>
