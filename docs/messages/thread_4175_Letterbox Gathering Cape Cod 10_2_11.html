We have a wonderful letterboxing gathering opportunity at the beautiful Cultural <br/>
Center of Cape Cod on October 2nd, 2011. It is part of our Treasures of Yarmouth <br/>
Scavenger Hunt, and there will be over a dozen new hand-carved stamps along our <br/>
map route, plus the chance to gather with other letterboxers at the reception in <br/>
the evening. The event is only $12,(children under 12 are free) and includes the <br/>
entire day's adventure plus a reception with live music, food and drinks. Truly <br/>
valubale prizes for successful "hunters"! The day allows plenty of time to go do <br/>
additional letterboxing - and there are a LOT of boxes in Yarmouth. We have <br/>
already posted on Atlas Quest - but would love to learn how to get the word out <br/>
throughout New England with your help! Thank you!</div>
