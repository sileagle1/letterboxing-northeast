broken glass and the possiblity that it maight not be good for dogs. <br/>
If you have already printed the clues to my new series, please be <br/>
advised that I just added a note about broken glass. During the off <br/>
trail travels, there is some glass and I would hate to be responsible <br/>
for some cut paws. Please be careful!<br/>
