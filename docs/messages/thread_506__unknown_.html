  &gt; HI buddyandpigtographer<br/>
  I guess if I put the time in setting them out I'll leave them up for a why.  I'll post their clues after the event.<br/>

  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt; On April 23-25, 3004 Blackstone Valley District will be holding a <br/>
  &gt; Earthday Camporee along the Blackstone River in Cumberland, RI.  <br/>
  &gt; During the day of Saturday April 24th our activities will consist <br/>
  of <br/>
  &gt; a river &amp; bike path clean up till noon. After that we're looking <br/>
  for <br/>
  &gt; some clinics put on by different outdoor organizations. I'm sorry <br/>
  &gt; about the short notice, we didn't have a go ahead by the town of <br/>
  &gt; Cumberland till now.  During the event there will by 12 letterboxes <br/>
  &gt; hidden with the 12 parts of the scout law. If anyone is interested <br/>
  in <br/>
  &gt; Running a clinic on letterboxing please contact me. <br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt; Thank You<br/>

  Will the boxes be available after the event?<br/>

&gt;  being of the hike!!!) We wanted to kill Northstar! so word of advice to anybody boxing with Northstar DON'T SHOW HIM ANY SNAKES if you want to make it back home!!!<br/>
