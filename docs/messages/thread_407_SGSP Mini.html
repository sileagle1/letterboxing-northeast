<br/>
Traveling from RI, we got there...a bit late (when everyone was <br/>
leaving!) and headed off with Alan and his crew.  After the River Run <br/>
LB and the Northern Raven, we lost not only Alan and his class but <br/>
Perl and EagleScout2002 - so we backtracked, had some lunch and <br/>
started up the tower trail (we were a bit wary of the possibility of <br/>
us going to LB on the giant...with no map)...so we found Rubaduc, <br/>
Butterfly, and SwampYankeeSunshine - as well as The Engraver, <br/>
Corrina, Mr. Peanut and Patriotic Girl, all four of whom we met at <br/>
the POE gathering.<br/>
<br/>
We had a great day (and a good hike to boot!)...it was a bit wet <br/>
(shoulda brought our galoshes!!)...but the view was INCREDIBLE from <br/>
atop the tower, the highest point in the park (at least I think it is <br/>
from consulting the map near the parking area)...thanks to Alan for <br/>
attracting quite a few letterboxers - we're kinda disappointed we <br/>
wern't able to get there earlier and maybe score some more exchanges <br/>
and the event stamps by Alan and Northstar - may we meet again!<br/>
<br/>
We might be turning something we found on the tower trail into <br/>
something to do with letterboxing - but what...?  We don't know yet - <br/>
all I know is that one man's trash is another man's treasure.<br/>
