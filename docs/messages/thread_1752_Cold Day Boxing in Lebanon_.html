to Lebanon this afternoon to finish the Hidden Cemetery series! <br/>
Tried to start it last week but the thick layer of icy snow made it <br/>
very difficult! Mr. Safety and M &amp; M spread a blanket out in the <br/>
middle of the cemetery with all the stamping in supplies while I <br/>
went hunting for the boxes and bringing them back! It was quite <br/>
comical! (AND COLD)!<br/>
<br/>
Also found Baby D Turns 2 and Blue Goose at the Town Pound, a hitch <br/>
hiker and a bonus for a total of 10 finds today! (Including the <br/>
Leprechaun in Colchester on our way to Lebanon! Whoo Hoo! Still more <br/>
to get there, perhaps only one more trip needed before Lebanon is <br/>
done!<br/>
