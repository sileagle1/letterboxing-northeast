                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1455587856">Today I decided that since I had about Â½ hour of free time I could 1) Clean<br/>
my house or 2) Run out and get the Peace letterbox in Windham and check on<br/>
my Windham Jail Break box. The latter idea won out. I strapped<br/>
three-year-old Rosie Bunny in the car and headed out. Got to the cemetery<br/>
and found PEACE. I brought it back to the van to stamp in. As I am stamping<br/>
away and trying to write a clever little note I noticed a car pull up behind<br/>
me and then to start to back out of the path I am parked on. The car parked<br/>
a little further down and a man let his dog out to run around the cemetery.<br/>
I began putting everything back into the box and tried to think of how to<br/>
get the box back in place without drawing attention to myself and the hiding<br/>
place. I look up and there is a different man looking in my window. So not<br/>
to look suspicious I let out a blood curdling<br/>
"BLAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!" and tossed the box to the floor. Looking<br/>
confused and very curious he peddled away on his bike but continued to keep<br/>
an eye on my van. I decided Peace would have to take a ride with me until<br/>
the coast was clear. I drove around for 15 minutes and return to find people<br/>
still there. So I drove off again. Long story short Peace visited Windham,<br/>
Sprague, and Scotland before returning to Windham an hour later. The<br/>
three-year-old was less than thrilled. The cemetery was empty when I<br/>
returned but I became a total freak darting to the hiding place and leaping<br/>
back into my car in record time. I never did check on Windham Jail-break.<br/>
Anyway the Peace box is fine except the baggie it is in has a broken zipper<br/>
and it was pretty exposed when I got there but that may be from spring thaw.</div>

I had a similar experience trying to get Peace. Got the box, and <br/>
then a guy in a red pickup truck was keeping an eye on me, so I <br/>
had to bolt and return with it later. I could not dare get the other <br/>
box; came another day when the truck was not in sight! Is it <br/>
some type of cruising area - see lots of those at less-used state <br/>
parks around the state!</div>
