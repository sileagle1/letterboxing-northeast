We decided to meet in Wallingford/North Haven at Wharton Brook SP.  I parked <br/>
really close to the main gate, hoping that they would only close the inner <br/>
gates.  We went to a different SF and found boxes there, only to get back to <br/>
Wharton Brook at about 8:35 p.m. (it was still light out!).  Unfortunately, all of <br/>
the gates were closed and my car was locked inside!  Well, after checking to <br/>
see if both gates are the guard shack were really locked and didn't just <br/>
"look" locked, we walked to the house next door which looked like the ranger's <br/>
house.  As we approached, we noticed that the gate between the house and the state <br/>
park was open, so I quickly got my car and drove out the gate (yes, I know it <br/>
said "not open to the public", but I REALLY needed my car for work tomorrow <br/>
morning!).  Some of you may know that Letterboxer2002 had a call on his phone <br/>
after boxing at night in a CT State Forest, so I was SO sure that I would have <br/>
a call from the DEP or Police on my phone when I got home.  Sure enough, the <br/>
message light was blinking on the phone.  As I listened to the message, it <br/>
wasn't the DEP or the police... it was my cousin just saying HI.  I was SO <br/>
disappointed!!!!  Oh well.... just remember.... they really DO mean sunset!<br/>

Happy Hunting everyone!<br/>
