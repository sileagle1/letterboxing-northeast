ones...are really appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
   A while ago (June-ish) we received an email stating our Chinese <br/>
Animals #1 (the whole thing?!) was GONE/MISSING.  Someone told them <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  But it is not (GONE/MISSING).  We checked.<br/>
<br/>
   A private email to the placer of the box when you find it saves <br/>
them/him/her a trip...and may yield further rewards.  <br/>
<br/>
   conversely, a private email to the placer of the box when you <br/>
can't find it...may yield further help on the box you wish to find.<br/>
<br/>
  We had received some feedback earlier on these boxes and after our <br/>
visit were pleased to see some other visits beyond that report!<br/>
