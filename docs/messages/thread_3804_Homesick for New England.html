drop me a line.  I love touring around with people "from away" and <br/>
sharing some of my local haunts, even if they don't (yet) have letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
I know the Midcoast well too, and there are plenty of boxers in that <br/>
area who would probably love to join any letterboxing summer tourist types.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not old, but I am gimpy, and can appreciate a slow, quiet pace.<br/>

  I didn't realize that you were living full time in Florida!  My husband and I spent the month of March there and saw your stamps in a letterbox at Kissimmee State Park.  I thought you might have been snowbirds.  Wow!  Hope you're doing some planting so we can find more boxes in the Kissimmee area next year.   <br/>
