My dad is a "resident" there and with is balding hair and black handle bar mustache my sisters and I think he'd get a real kick out of us doing that.  Doesn't look doable for us this year, but if you do some research it's a very historic cemetery with lots of "famous" residents.  Have fun and Happy Halloween!<br/>

Intentions. You can find the info here ...<br/>

<br/>
It is a fundraiser to benefit the Tilden House (The Little Red House) which<br/>
I placed a letterbox for (shameless plug) at Pequitside Farm in Canton.<br/>
<br/>
Just in case anyone is interested!<br/>
