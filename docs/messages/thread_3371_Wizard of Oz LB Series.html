You could try for the first box - not to long of a walk in a nice area (although you'll need orange). Dave and I have done the series. Have you contacted the placer?<br/>

  I noticed that the Carolina Management Center in RI has a Wizard of Oz <br/>
  LB series listed but I also saw that the last find was quite some time <br/>
  ago. I wanted to take my daughter to find these since she loves the <br/>
  movie but I don't want to find out that none of them are there any <br/>

Two in Chittenango...home of Frank Baum, and host town of the Wizard of Oz Parade and Celebration every year. Also a stamp in North Syracuse, boyhood home of the author, and in the forest that inspired that creepy forest from the book and movie.<br/>
<br/>
The boxes are Dorothy Gale, Toto, and the Wizard of Oz Memorial Forest. A;; are available now, although Dorothy should not be attempted if it is icy.<br/>

previous box there's not much point in doing it until the first box <br/>
is replaced.  The plan is to permenantly write the clues in each box <br/>
(vice place a limited number of copies for the finders to take).  The <br/>
person who wrote the clues and did most of the planting (not me) has <br/>
offered to replace the first box and maintain the remainder at the <br/>
same time.<br/>
