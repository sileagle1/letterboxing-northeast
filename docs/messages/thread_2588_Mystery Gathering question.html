<br/>
A great gathering ... surprised to see so many people at this one,<br/>
especially compared to the relatively small mystery gathering last year.<br/>
<br/>
Good to see Brian and Lori from Team Green Dragon come up from New Jersey.<br/>
<br/>
I was glad to meet the group of Cape Cod 'boxers, all of whom I know<br/>
by signature stamp but never before had met.<br/>
<br/>
And what a great little village Wickford is!  I'll be back with the SO<br/>
to explore more.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, always thanks to Pointer Party for letting me tag along on<br/>
the hunts (Kreepy Kelli as well).<br/>
<br/>
And -- for those who like to share in milestones, I finally hit F500<br/>
at the event -- with Mark &amp; Sue's Kitchen Angel box.  It's taken a<br/>
year-and-a-half to get here, but I'm hoping that it will not be<br/>
another year-and-a-half to hit the illustrious F1000 mark!  Brandy,<br/>
Warrior Woman, Team Randalstik and anyone else who wants to -- I'm<br/>
counting on you guys to continue to 'box with me so I can get that<br/>
next milestone!!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OK, question ...<br/>
<br/>
I have misplaced the clues to the Path of Angels series, and haven't<br/>
recorded the proper name and carver of each of the three stamps in<br/>
that series. Could someone list them, please?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks!<br/>
<br/>
See you all at the next gathering!!<br/>
