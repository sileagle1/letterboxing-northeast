boxes created by Teach and  Preach's  2 talented letterboxing kids. <br/>
As a cat lover (and reader) of the most exteme kind, how could I not <br/>
be drawn to seek out stamps in a series in honor of a favorite author <br/>
of mine!  I have to admit the lefts and rights and references to <br/>
changes of trails based on color codes had me confused.  I kept <br/>
looking for the boxes too soon! After backtracking and second <br/>
guessing, all 5 boxes were stamped into. <br/>
  Heads up--the first bridge is totally submerged. I walked across in <br/>
waterproof boots with the rapidly flowing stream up to my ankles.<br/>

<br/>
A funny thing - we found box #1 and #4 at the same time!!  Guess when you've been boxing a while, you get to know what looks like a great hiding place!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for this series - we enjoyed it!<br/>
