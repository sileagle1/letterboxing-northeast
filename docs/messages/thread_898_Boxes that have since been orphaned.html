                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-929219334">I know that Mark Pepe may have a site on this subject, but I am going to put <br/>
this out there for everyone.  There was a question about missing boxes on the <br/>
list today that I gave a very lengthy answer to.  I feel very strongly that <br/>
people should at least take some ownership of their boxes.  Now, of course, I <br/>
have some boxes in other states that I can't get to, but when I hear that it <br/>
might be missing, I do write a note on the clues.<br/>
<br/>
I'm wondering if people would be willing to use the "contact placer" button <br/>
on the clues for any boxes that may be abandoned and see if these people are <br/>
still boxing?  If not or if they don't answer within a certain amount of time, <br/>
can these boxes be adopted on the site by others who can check up on these <br/>
boxes?<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering.....  If you feel as though I should crawl back into my house <br/>
and keep reading about Methods in Philosophical Research, just let me know!<br/>

<br/>
if someone is going to plant in a state or place that would be difficult to check on if it's reported missing, maybe you could find a fellow boxer in that state to sort of adopt the box and check on it for you?  that way if it goes missing, you know that someone could check and confirm or provide any maintenence needed.<br/>
<br/>
also, maybe put up a date when it's reported missing just in case someone else has found it since then and can inform the owner.  i've noticed that sometimes there is no date.<br/>
<br/>
just my 2 cents :)<br/>

I feel that "no response" is not a good enough reason to just make <br/>
off with someone else's box.  People have different ideas on why they <br/>
place a box.  If we don't agree with the placer's interpretation of <br/>
caretking, we can just find some other box.  After all, this is New <br/>

my fly in the ointment.<br/>
<br/>
I have adopted four boxes, some with the original placer's blessing, <br/>
some not.  Why?  Because the clues are hyperlinks to another site <br/>
that is no longer active.  Two fine examples are Point Judith and <br/>
Just Bass in Narragansett RI.  MadMary did give me her blessing to <br/>
adopt the boxes, but the webmasters at LbNA preferred that I keep the <br/>
hyperlink clues intact instead of re-entering the clues as text.  The <br/>
only connection to me was via "Contact the Placer" which would <br/>
redirect the email to me.<br/>
<br/>
So I kept the hyperlinks active as instructed.<br/>
<br/>
Now the hyperlinks don't work, I get emails from "seekers" <br/>
asking "what happened to the clues?" and I am now working with Wes to <br/>
figure out how to "fix" it so that I can edit the clues and remove <br/>
the hyperlink and re-enter the clues as text.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened with Bonsai and Piece of Cake.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, I have the text on my hard drive of all my placed and <br/>
adopted boxes, just in case this sort of thing should happen.<br/>
<br/>
Caretaking is one thing (and I'm meticulous about that).  Just plain <br/>
old access to the clues in the first place is another.  If I come <br/>
across a letterbox that I can easily maintain that fits both <br/>
categories, I am quick to contact the placer (if I can) to get <br/>
permission to adopt the box, and if I can't get ahold of the placer, <br/>
and the clues go "lost in cyberspace", I usually have a hard copy of <br/>
the clues handy and will adopt it.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I am quick to "give it back" if the original placer does <br/>
eventually show up (ie Grey Reservation in Sudbury, previously <br/>
adopted and since given back to its birth parent).<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes I have a fondness for particular letterboxes/placers <br/>
and will "babysit" a box or two (several of the Magic Tree House <br/>
Series, Four Faces of Wickford, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
Just trying to be helpful!<br/>

It has happened, it is happening, and it will happen that people <br/>
will plant boxes and post clues, then loose the interest or ability <br/>
to continue to maintain them.  Then the web site will gather invalid <br/>
clues that direct us to empty locations.  This is frustrating for <br/>
those of us who are hoping for a reasonable chance to succeed in <br/>
following the clues and find a plastic treasure box.<br/>
<br/>
A measure of how much we value something is the degree to which we <br/>
keep it clean.  Just ask the dust bunnies under my bed.  I feel <br/>
there needs to be some proceedure that will deal with unmaintained <br/>
clues.<br/>
<br/>
Having them adopted by an active boxer would be best if the box is <br/>
found in the location.  If a person who found the box before, or a <br/>
certain number of experienced boxers, attempt to find it and can't, <br/>
and the owner of the clues is unresponsive to reports of it being <br/>
missing, the clues must suffer the ultimate fate.<br/>
<br/>
I don't like the imposistion of (ugh) rules, but that is the way to <br/>
value the remaining clues that are valid and kept up to date by <br/>
active boxers.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2080427975">We touched on this topic on the main board a few times.  Basically, <br/>
it all comes down to personal responsibility.  If you plant a box but <br/>
then cannot care for it, attempt to find a caretaker or adopter.  <br/>
Depending on what your involvement with the box will be, update your <br/>
clues to keep them current.  If you aren't willing to do this, then <br/>
ask the adopter to do so -- and provide them the details.  If someone <br/>
reports your box as missing, confirm or deny it.  Double check in the <br/>
field to see if it is, in fact, missing.  If you can't get out to <br/>
check, have a caretaker check or, at a minimum, list the box <br/>
as "potetnially missing" in your clues.  If the box is gone, pull the <br/>
clues or indicate as such.  If you decide to leave the hobby, pull <br/>
your boxes and clues, or find adopters for them.<br/>
<br/>
It's all up to YOU the placer.  We can institute rules, but they <br/>
can't be enforced.  The best we can do is to provide guidelines and <br/>
encourage placers to follow them.  Let's hope that's enough.<br/>
