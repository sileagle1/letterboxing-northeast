I'd love to get a clue book, but the email address on their site is<br/>
bouncing back. I've tried contacting some people at the AMC chapter<br/>
there but haven't gotten anywhere with that. Is there a phone number?<br/>

We also had a heck of a time tracking down the correct people and <br/>
the booklet. It seems to be out on the fringe of regular AMC <br/>
activities. I finally picked one up in a trinket shop in downtown <br/>
Quincy called Abigail's Crossing (they have a website).<br/>
<br/>
Supposedly, the booklets are also available at:<br/>
Bookport, 21 Main Street, Hingham <br/>
Hingham Public Library, 66 Leavitt St., Hingham <br/>
South Shore Natural Science Center, Jacobs Lane, Norwell <br/>
<br/>
Be aware that not all the quests are left out for the entire year. <br/>
Most are taken in for the winter. I think a new booklet is published <br/>
each year so if you persist in finding the right person by <br/>
telephone, you may be able to find out when the 2004 version is out.<br/>
<br/>
We had a lot of fun doing these quests and exploring the south shore <br/>
and the patch is nice besides.<br/>
<br/>
See you soon!<br/>
