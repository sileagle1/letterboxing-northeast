I am not a very active poster on the big list, but maybe I'll post<br/>
more here. <br/>
<br/>
I am all for a gathering in MA!!! Then I can bring my letterboxing<br/>
companion (Camera Obscura) who lives in Boston (and joyfully helped me<br/>
solve the clues to Paul Revere box-now I just have to get there).<br/>
<br/>
I'm also all for one in Maine, if you want Phyto! I'll help... I had<br/>
fun helping with the summer one. <br/>
<br/>
Hope you're all well. Happy holidays to everyone...<br/>

</span></blockquote>Welcome aboard , Amymisha ! I'm hoping you will decide to post more <br/>
often on this new list . That's really the reason for it's <br/>
conception . Local people posting about local letterboxing . I want <br/>
to remind people to spread the word about this , so feel free to <br/>
invite whomever you please to sign up . Does anyone have a way to get <br/>
in touch with B'fly , Musicwomen , Moonstone , etc , etc . If so give <br/>
them a holler, I'm feeling a little sneaky , with this going on <br/>
behind there backs . I don't really feel like making an anouncement <br/>
on the big list , but don't want some of the best of our local boxers <br/>
being in the dark ,so to speak .<br/>
<br/>
Thanks !<br/>
<br/>
Brian<br/>

</span></blockquote>Hi Amy &amp; welcome KStar - great to find you guys on this more local<br/>
list. I hope that this will bring our New England community together.<br/>
<br/>
As for the gathering, seems like there might just be enough people<br/>
and/or interest to hold our very own Maine Winter gathering (!) but<br/>
for now, I'm content to mull it over some hot cider.<br/>
