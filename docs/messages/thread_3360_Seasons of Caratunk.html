                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-583021757">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to give you the heads up.Audubon Rhode Island who owns and<br/>
manages Caratunk (even though it is in MA), doesn't permit letterboxing or<br/>
geocaching.  I am one of the refuge managers for them (I manage the<br/>
Smithfield and North Smithfield refuges), and I have been trying to persuade<br/>
them (being a letterboxer myself and one of several 'boxers on our staff) to<br/>
allow letterboxing, but I haven't quite changed their minds yet. They see<br/>
letterboxes as a bit of trespassing and a bit of litter. They haven't quite<br/>
gotten the point that it is a great opportunity to get people to visit our<br/>
refuges and a great family activity. I have managed to get them to agree to<br/>
the idea of the refuge managers or our education department placing Quests<br/>
or Audubon-sponsored boxes. We have not yet sold them on the idea of<br/>
allowing others to place boxes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mike, the refuge manager at Caratunk, is a great guy, but he will adhere to<br/>
the policy and remove the box and contact the placer if he finds out about<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So..my recommendation and request to everyone out there seeking this<br/>
box..please don't attract attention to yourself and if you see that a trail<br/>
is being formed to the box, please let JAMO know so they can move or remove<br/>
the box. With your help, we might just convince them yet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!! Keep on boxin'!<br/>

I got permission to plant by promising to place the box so that people didn't have to leave the trail to find it, thus making it less likely for damage to delicate habitats. Perhaps that's an option at Caratunk.<br/>
