Directions series.  (I live in Manchester, but we could meet at the <br/>
WestFarms area or something.)  I would like to do one or two hikes a <br/>
day, using two cars so we wouldn't have to double back.  If we carpool, <br/>
gas would be SOOO much cheaper!  I can fit four in my car (once my car <br/>
is running again), and if someone else is willing to drive, we can get <br/>
about eight people to go.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to start up an e-mail list of those who would like to go, <br/>
and would be able to drive.  Please e-mail me off list if you're <br/>
interested!  I would like to finish the series by Thanksgiving if <br/>
possible!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
