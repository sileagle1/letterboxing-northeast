ours has started carrying L&amp;Ls. Most of the small ones come in the  <br/>
sets with the really big ones, but there are some that are smaller  <br/>
than sandwich-size available separately.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't want the large sized L&amp;Ls that come in the sets, feel  <br/>
free to put a holiday bow on them and mail them out here. I'll put  <br/>
them to good use. :-D<br/>

large Lock &amp; Lock.  I bought a set, hoping that I can use the large <br/>
size for storage in my basement or something....<br/>
<br/>
The nice thing was, that it was only $6.99, and the large one by <br/>
itself was $4.99, so I'm getting those tiny ones for a dollar a <br/>
piece!  When I get more $, I'll go back and stock up on some <br/>
others.  I do have the sandwich size L&amp;L at home from Walmart, which <br/>
work for average size boxes.  Too bad Walmart doesn't have the <br/>
sets....  They're usually even cheaper!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your suggestions!  I haven't gotten a chance to head to <br/>
Linens and THings yet (the mall traffic is CRAZY here in Manchester, <br/>
I try to stay clear until after Christmas), but perhaps if I get a <br/>
day off from school tomorrow, I'll head out (snow doesn't bother <br/>
me!).  Though, the kids tomorrow DO NOT need a day off from <br/>
school... they need tomorrow for their last practice before their <br/>
concert!<br/>
