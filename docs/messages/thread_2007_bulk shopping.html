<br/>
I was just looking at the Staedtler Mastercarve carving blocks at the following website: <a href="http://www.misterart.com/store/view.cfm?group_id=5908602&amp;store=001&amp;AID=10273655&amp;PID=1606362." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.misterart.com/store/view.cfm?group_id=5908602&amp;store=001&amp;AID=10273655&amp;PID=1606362.</a><br/>
<br/>
Specifically the 4x4x1/2 inch blocks selling for $1.82 each. I'd love to get it at this price, but the shipping ruins the deal unless you buy bulk. I went through the buying process to see how many I could get for the same shipping price and I can get about 12 before the price goes up. BUT I don't WANT 12! <br/>
<br/>
So, anyone else in central CT want to bulk buy with me, I'd be happy to meet in a central location and distribute them. $4.98 in shipping distributed over 12 blocks only raises the price by .42, which is far better than I pay locally.  I only want one or two at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
If so, email me directly... not a big deal, just thought I'd give it a try!<br/>
