 These boxes were found and in good shape:<br/>
Sea Stamp- box 1<br/>
Fort Point<br/>
Lobster Letterbox<br/>
Spellcaster<br/>
Snail Power<br/>
Saturn in Maine<br/>
<br/>
I was unable to locate Whaleback Shell Midden.  It may be there as it<br/>
was placed in Feb and now very overgrown.<br/>
<br/>
Also, made a day trip with Holster-roo and found these boxes:<br/>
<br/>
The Art Guru and OM Letterbox.  We found a mystery one too that we<br/>
have been meaning to find for a long time but won't tell as not to<br/>
give away the location<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
