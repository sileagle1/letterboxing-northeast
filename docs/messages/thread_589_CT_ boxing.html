Conservation area. After placing the "Harwinton Hummingbird" <br/>
and realizing that there are 5 boxes in her series, it was nice to <br/>
have some others to find!  There were some wonderful mosses <br/>
and wildflowers out on the trail.  Two of the boxes were not re-hid <br/>
very well, but in the usual Maine style, I made sure to take care of <br/>
that with a few mini-boulders and natural covering! :-)<br/>
<br/>
After finishing the series we (brother and I) went and checked on <br/>
the Hummingbird and it was great to see the box still intact and <br/>
with many visitors to boot! I'm glad that you folks don't have a <br/>
problem finding the clues after my recent move to pulling them <br/>
off the LBNA page.<br/>
<br/>
I placed an urban box this weekend and I have another to <br/>
accompany it, but 'yall will have to wait on the clues till they're <br/>
more thought out. Urban boxing is quite tricky...<br/>
<br/>
More to come -<br/>
