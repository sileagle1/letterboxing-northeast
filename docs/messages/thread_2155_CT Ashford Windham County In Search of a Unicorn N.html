The store bought stamp has been replaced with a hand made stamp. It's the same box, same log book, same location,  just a different stamp......Chuck and Molly<br/>

<br/>
I planted a box that required you to untie a long string and lower the box to stamp in..then raise the box back up and tie it off again. However, I did not state this in the instructions. I wanted boxers to be surprised when they discovered it and I thought it was self explanatory how to get the box down. I used very hideable string ( wax coated hemp) and tested it several times myself with no problems. The string was well hidden and the box was undetectable as well.<br/>
<br/>
Well, never take anything for granted. Judging by the notes from those who stamped in as well as reports I got from people who emailed me recently.. I needed to check the box. I now  know I needed to leave specific instructions on how to remove and replace the box.<br/>
<br/>
Some people tried to throw the box back up over the branch, some tried to tie longer pieces of rope which were NOT hideable but at least they could get it back up there. All of these things were done with the best of intentions and my best guess is that the long original string somehow got broken and boxers did their best to preserve the hiding spot. Alas, it was not enough as the box was discovered and stolen. At least they left the stamp and the logbook!!<br/>
<br/>
I now will switch to tougher, hideable string ( such as fishing line) and I will replace the box nearby with instructions. Thank you so much for those of you who tried to fix the broken string  and rehide the box! I appreciate everything you tried to do. For a short time, this box will be retired but will be readded and rehidden shortly. Thanks again!<br/>

Chuck Straub...he's got a box like that and has some<br/>
pretty heavy duty stuff holding it up.  <br/>
