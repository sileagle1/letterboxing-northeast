placing a letterbox not to far from there -- on Georges Island,<br/>
actually.  Unfortunately, it won't be placed until I head out there on<br/>
August 26.  Too bad, really.  The box is all ready to go!<br/>

Hope you got someone to take them.<br/>

And to make this one more letterboxing appropriate, has anyone found <br/>
the letterbox in Charlestown by the NPS site?<br/>
