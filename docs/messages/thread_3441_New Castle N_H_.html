 If you're up in the Porstmouth NH area drive over to New Castle and <br/>
look for the "Live Free Or Die" Letterbox, it was a fun walk and a <br/>
real nice area.  I took my husband to NH for his birthday and we did a <br/>
few Letterboxes; couldn't find "Hear The Sea" but the fort and walk <br/>
were worth it.  Lee</div>
