                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1339164005">I just finished two full days of letterboxing in Rhode Island with <br/>
Music Woman.  I was surprised at how many boxes had little activity <br/>
over the past year.  I went to one new box in North Kingstown that I <br/>
believe has been out there for a month and no one had been there <br/>
yet.  I went and did Wanda's winter Holiday series (very, very nice <br/>
walk in Arcadia; cute stamps too).  This series is seasonal and has <br/>
been out since early December and is only out until early January.  <br/>
No one had been there yet either.  This series has 8 letterboxes in a <br/>
fairly short distance.  Can't understand why no one had been out <br/>
there yet.<br/>
<br/>
You could say that these recent boxes haven't been visited because of <br/>
the bad weather and the busy Holidays. I can understand that. But we <br/>
also went to some older boxes that only 3 or 4 people had been to all <br/>
year.  This surprised me.  These were not mystery boxes or hard to <br/>
find boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if other people had noticed low visitations to their <br/>
boxes in Rhode Island.  I also wonder if anyone had any ideas why.  <br/>
Just curious.  <br/>

I've placed 9 letterboxes in the northern end of Rhode Island this <br/>
year and the visitations to them have been pretty high. In most cases <br/>
there has been 20 to 30 visitors to them. In fact I received an e-<br/>
mail from a family today that visited my Diamond Hill Box and they <br/>
sent me pictures of the box &amp; stamping in. Which I thought was great.<br/>
<br/>
As for the low numbers in other areas, there is something called the <br/>
Rhode Island Mentality (LOL) were if it's a 15min. drive your looking <br/>
at a day trip and if your heading to the beach pack your bags.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great New Year<br/>

   It's not just RI. I've noticed the same in Connecticut. B'Fly and <br/>
I noticed only 3 or 4 finders before us on the "12 Days of Xmas" <br/>
series which is also seasonal. As I mentioned in an earlier post, <br/>
Jay's wonderful "White Rock Quarry" did not have a visitor between my <br/>
visit in September until I took B Fly there in December.   <br/>
<br/>
I don't know what to say about the RI boxes other than the fact that <br/>
I will (weather pending), try to make the trip to Arcadia on <br/>
Thursday!  Thats another place I could spend all day hiking and <br/>
boxing in, so we've been putting it off until Heidi and I have a <br/>
common day off. Of course, that never happens anymore!  <br/>

    I have also noticed many boxes here in Connecticut that have not had many visitors.  I have come to the conclusion that there are now so many boxes in this area, that people just can't get to them all.  I know I have an enormous pile of clues printed out to boxes I would love to visit.  There is only so much time however, so people can only whittle away at the huge number of boxes slowly.  Way back when, there weren't quite so many boxes to choose from, many people were just waiting for new boxes to find, so when the clues came up they flocked to the box right away. I'm not really sure what to do about that.  I guess that's why I tried hiding my series for a limited time, that way by the time people forgot about them, they would be removed anyway.  I think a little promotion from recent finders certainly helps.  That way boxers know they should find the box in good condition, and recent finders can try to entice them with a few details of how wonderful the hike was or something.<br/>

<br/>
I hadn't thought of it that way, but I too have a huge pile of <br/>
printed out clues that I really want to do but never seem to have <br/>
enough time to get to.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Many people were just waiting for new boxes to find, so when the <br/>

<br/>
Yes... the newer boxes do seem to get a lot of activity.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I guess that's why I tried hiding my series for a limited time, <br/>

anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
That's a good point too.  If letterboxes are only out for a limited <br/>
time they probably are going to stay in fairly good shape.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy coming up with new ideas for letterbox series.  Maybe as I <br/>
put out a new series I can retire an older one and give everyone <br/>
a "last call before retirement."  <br/>
<br/>
Another thing I've noticed is that the quality of carvings has <br/>
improved dramatically over the past two years.  I think people like <br/>
going to the new series especially when they know there will be some <br/>
neat new carvings.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your thoughts, Melissa.<br/>

Yes... the newer boxes do seem to get a lot of activity.<br/>
It is for that reason that CSCM and I have been purposely looking for the <br/>
older boxes recently. We figure that many of them will most likely be retired or <br/>
go missing before the newer ones, so we are seeking them before it's too late.<br/>
