<br/>
There seems to be some confusion here is the information you need to <br/>
know.  My "Hiking In Connecticut" adult education class will be out <br/>
letterboxing &amp; geocaching these dates.  I was hoping for many <br/>
letterboxers (and geocachers) to join us for a fun filled hike.  It <br/>
would mean alot to the class to meet other hikers who are as <br/>
enthusiastic as I am.  On a more personal note ... I miss you all <br/>
and would love to get together.  For the original post see #670.<br/>
<br/>

Hope to see you all there!  Safe Letterboxing- Letterboxer2002 (Alan)</div>
