upstate NY. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Miss Buggy and I were unsuccessful in finding the Five Rivers box, but <br/>
we did snag the Town Park box. Town Park was in great shape, though the <br/>
ink pad was dry. The ground sure wasn't dry! We sank into mud up to our <br/>
ankles all over the place. lol<br/>
<br/>
Just happy to have a lovely boxing day,<br/>
