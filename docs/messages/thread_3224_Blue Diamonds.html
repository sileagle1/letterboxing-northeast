they have intentionally limited the overall number of Blue Diamonds.<br/>
That way as more people rank, the "good" boxes will lose their Blue<br/>
Diamonds leaving only "great" boxes... then only "excellent" boxes,<br/>
etc.  They also mentioned that with the limited number of ratings to<br/>
start with there would be sudden jumps until there was more of a<br/>
baseline to average against.  Finally, they said that the actual<br/>
formula was rather complex and something they were not going to share<br/>
for fear of someone trying to "cheat" the system.<br/>
