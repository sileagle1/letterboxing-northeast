  Imagine my surprise, and delight, to find all three in place and in great shape. Big thanks to the last finder of each box for doing such a good job re-hiding them-one I even thought was missing!!!<br/>

  We did, however, pull the series as the trail is incredibly overgrown. They will find a new home as this was such a wonderful thing that my teenage daughter did for me. <br/>
