box maintenance hospital page, I'd like some kind kind boxer in (Southern) Maine <br/>
to rescue the following box(es)... <br/>
<br/>
Saco Heath #1 and 2 are still intact, the clue has changed slightly for the one I <br/>
placed - thank you to Giddy! and Isoscele's box is also fine, however - back in the <br/>
days of non-log-book-making I used really terrible non-bound logbooks. These <br/>
are prone to having the glued sheets tear out, and as I was informed that is just the <br/>
case with these logs. <br/>
<br/>
I need a boxer willing and able to replace the logbooks - or to at least pull the box <br/>
temporarily while I procure a new log so that I can replace the old. If anyone is <br/>
willing to accomplish this task please contact <a href="mailto:phyto_me@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">phyto_me@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Thanks <br/>
