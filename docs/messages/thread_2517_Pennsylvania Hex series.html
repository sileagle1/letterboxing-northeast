<br/>
   I just happened to be looking for the Hex series yesterday afternoon! I knew they were <br/>
leaving in November and didn't want to miss them. What a wonderful walk in the woods <br/>
and such great boxes. It just so happened that we bumped into Choi as he was doing the <br/>
series as well. He had very kindly done some box maintenance in the form of rebagging <br/>
some of the pieces. All in all I thought they were in decent shape (thanks to Choi's <br/>
thoughtfullness). Thanks for bring these boxes out from Pennsylvania!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion</div>
