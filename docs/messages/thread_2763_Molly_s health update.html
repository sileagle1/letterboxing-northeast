                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-471581863">Thank you everyone for all the emails concerning Molly's health problems. She did have her toe amputated and it was found to have cancer. She is home recovering and hopefully she will be ok. I have provided a link to a page on my website which we will keep updated for anyone wanting to check on Molly's progress. Again thank you all for the emails, cards, visits and gifts for Molly. I really appreciate everything. Here is the link to follow Molly's health progress. ...Chuck<br/>
