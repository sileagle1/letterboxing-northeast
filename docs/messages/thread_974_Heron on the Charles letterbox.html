this letterbox, I recalled that the bridge listed in the last part of <br/>
the clues is under construction and not able to be crossed.  This <br/>
does not impede one's ability to fetch the box, but an alternate <br/>
crossing will have to be sought out in order to return from the box's <br/>
hiding spot.  Allot a little additional time if you're heading for <br/>
this box.<br/>
<br/>
(Note: We hunted this box on June 30.  My guess is that the bridge is <br/>
still out of service today).<br/>
