<br/>
We'll be attending the Historic Hudson Valley event on Labor Day weekend and will actually be out in NY for 10+ days of hiking &amp; boxing.  We're flying into Albany, so are thinking of spending 5 nights in the Adirondacks and then 5 nights near the Catskills.<br/>
<br/>
We're researching clues &amp; boxes in the area and have a nice list going.  However we'd love to get any specific recommendations that any of you might have.  We particularly like longer hikes.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone also has recommendations for a good town to stay in and any favorite restaurants, we'd appreciate the info!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
