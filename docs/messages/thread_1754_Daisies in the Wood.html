Painterly and 46R have found what we believe to be an abandoned <br/>
letterbox. We would gladly adopt it and care for it as it is quite <br/>
close to our home.  Daisies in the Wood was  planted on July 2, <br/>
2001. We visited it not long after that as our 9th letterbox!  It <br/>
was planted by Churchill and Pinecone.  While hiking on Saturday, <br/>
46R found it where it should have been, but the last recorded <br/>
visitor was July 30, 2002. The clues are not on the Letterboxing <br/>
site. Please let us know it Churchill and Pinecone want to still <br/>
maintain the letterbox. A new development road has been cut, and the <br/>
letterbox needs to be moved, and the clues need to be updated and <br/>
placed on the letterboxing site. Thanks for any help! I have posted <br/>
on the letterboxing basement group and will post on the letterboxing <br/>
usa group to see if anyone knows Churchill and Pinecone.<br/>
Painterly and 46R<br/>
