where it is, you should seek out this limited time only letterboxing <br/>
gem by sadie&amp;russ. Words can not quite describe the uniqueness of <br/>
this box. I for one enjoyed it very much and will miss it when it is <br/>
gone. My advice is to get out to guilford, ct. as soon as you can to <br/>
enjoy this wonderful box. I one day hope to create such a box/stamp <br/>
as good as this one. But I digress....   --NORTHSTAR</div>
