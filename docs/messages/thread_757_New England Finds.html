This pasted week I've visited three great areas for letterboxing.  <br/>
The first was during my lunch break in Bristol, RI and I stopped off <br/>
to find the Mount Hope Farm Series. All three boxes are in good <br/>
shape. Then this weekend I traveled to Maine for a 50-mile canoe trip <br/>
on the Saco River with my scouts and during the trip we stopped at <br/>
the Brownfield Bog Cattails &amp; Smooth Sailing Letterboxes in <br/>
Brownfield, Maine. Although not visited to often they are both in <br/>
great spots with incredible views.  <br/>

My letterboxing treks this past couple of weekends have been great. <br/>
I hit a 100 % find.<br/>
On 8/28/04 we found: <br/>
1. Chamberlain-Reynolds Memorial Forest Letterbox near Center  <br/>
Harbor, NH and planted by Dancin' Feet.  Our search for this box <br/>
took place in the evening and just as we found it, a Loon started <br/>
its mournful call. We had a resident from NH with us and she <br/>
couldn't believe she never had been to this beautiful area before. <br/>
The power of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
2. Tannery Hill Bridge LB in the town of Gilford and planted by Son <br/>
of a Sailor. We arrived at the covered bridge in the dark and were <br/>
surprised by a bridge lit with lanterns for old town day. We <br/>
retrieved the letterbox and opened it under the light of the bridge.<br/>
<br/>
On 9/05/04 I found the Des Types A La Porte letterbox series in <br/>
Taunton, Mass. and was planted by Teamgreendragon.  After a great <br/>
trek around the park I found all 3 boxes in good shape.<br/>
<br/>
On 9/06/04 while biking the East Bay Bike Path, from E. Providence, <br/>
RI to Bristol, RI and back,  I for the Jogger and the Wheelchair <br/>
Letterboxes in good shape.<br/>
