  About a year ago I launched "Wings of Peace" hitchhiker.  The last I heard it had traveled to Prayer Rock (I am assuming it is no longer there as someone has just posted that they visited Prayer Rock and they didn't mention a hitchhiker).  If you have any idea where it is, I would love to hear about it.  It was my first and only hitchhiker and I only heard that one report about it last year.  Thanks for any info!<br/>
