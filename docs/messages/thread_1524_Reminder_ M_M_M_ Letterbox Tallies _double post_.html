Only 14, and no bonus or hitchhikers along the way, but not bad for only two days out. We were extremely impressed with all the great carvings! Thanks everyone, wish we had time for more!<br/>
<br/>
We went today for my daughter's 6th birthday (her choice). I carved my first stamps...updating mine and making it a bit smaller and making a signature stamp for my daughter...watch for her... m &amp; m. next we have to get dad's carved...!<br/>
