<br/>
As some of you know, I'm a park ranger for the DEP this summer.  I talked to <br/>
my supervisor, who is a full-time ranger.  I asked him if the DEP had changed <br/>
its policy as far as letterboxing, and he said no.  He said that letterboxes <br/>
are welcome in the state parks and forests.  He also told me that individual <br/>
parks can set their own rules, and that he's not in charge of Bluff Point and <br/>
Harkness, so he can't speak for them specifically.<br/>
<br/>
Today, Music Woman talked to a ranger at Bluff Point who told her that <br/>
they're still OK with boxes too.<br/>
<br/>
I'm guessing we're dealing with a muggle here.  I can't believe that someone <br/>
would put THAT much time and energy into pulling people's boxes.  The ones at <br/>
Avery Point are missing as well, and those are not DEP boxes.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has boxes in Groton, Waterford and/or the surrounding area and <br/>
wants me to pull them for them for safekeeping until this blows over, please email <br/>
me.  I'm a teacher on summer vacation and can do that for you this week if <br/>
you'd like.<br/>
<br/>
Just trying to do my part.  This is a sad development.<br/>
