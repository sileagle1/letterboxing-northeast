<br/>
This box is gone, the stamp was taken, but the box was still in tact<br/>
and postcards good enough (though soaked) to make it back to me with<br/>
one last image of that fateful stamp. Gosh, I'll miss that box.<br/>

I had a bad feeling about replacing this box with such a well<br/>
re-constructed logbook and posting it for the taking. The more boxes<br/>
like this that get trashed, the less clues available to the masses.<br/>

BUMMER!!!<br/>
