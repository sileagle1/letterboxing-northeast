<br/>
Can anyone tell me some good hikes with views and of course some letterboxes as well in MA?  My brother from Alaska is home and we're going hiking on Monday.  We would like something in the Southern part of the state, closer to the CT border.  Any input would be appreciated.<br/>

"Time to Go," which is a mystery box, can be easily<br/>
solved. It has a wonderful hike, and definitely the<br/>
best view I have ever seen while letterboxing. Check<br/>
it out if you like!<br/>

aware that Ryan heard from "the authorities" not long after he planted it <br/>
that the box was illegal and would be removed. He's never received a find <br/>
report and doesn't think it likely that the box is still there. We spent <br/>
some time looking for it anyway  when we hiked Mt Greylock in June, but <br/>
came up empty-handed . The hike up the mountain is a gorgeous one, well <br/>
worth taking even if you don't end up finding the box.<br/>

The best view I found so far was not much of a hike. It is in New Salem, MA and is called Quabbin View. This is little more than a drive-by. It overlooks the Quabbin Resevoir and you get a great view of Monadnock to the north. To get an alternate perspective of the Quabbin try Ye Ole Fishing Hole. It brings you very near water lavel. While in that area there are a number of other boxes in and around the Shutesbury/Pelham/Amherst area and some of those can stretch your legs a bit.<br/>

Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell me some good hikes with views and of course some letterboxes as <br/>
well in MA?  My brother from Alaska is home and we're going hiking on Monday.  <br/>
We would like something in the Southern part of the state, closer to the CT <br/>
border.  Any input would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and Enjoy!<br/>
