successful.  We had lots of interested families take advantage of the <br/>
stamps that were available to use for the day, which had been provided <br/>
by D.E.P.  Lots of folks stopped by to learn a bit about letterboxing, <br/>
and we cheerfully gave them answers to their questions.  This was the <br/>
9th weekend event as part of D.E P's Great park Pursuit/No Child Left <br/>
Inside. There were many other activities available to the families to <br/>
do and try, and all free of charge. The Pointer Party were there in <br/>
Mideval Armor giving a sword fighting demo.  The Kids loved that, <br/>
too!  Thanks to Sojourner for the loan of her Letterboxing 101 <br/>
display.  It was perfect.  There was even an event stamp provided by <br/>
D.E. P.  Great Day!!<br/>

Kinda makes me wish that there were more evnts like this. For those that didnt go...I recommend that you place it in the calender for next year<br/>
