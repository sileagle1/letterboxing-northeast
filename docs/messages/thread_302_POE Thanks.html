With each gathering it's great to meet new 'boxers and get to know "old friends" a little better. The apres-gathering dinner at Tweed's was appreciated as well. Til the next time!<br/>

great event! Thanks also to Farmer Harvey for the wonderful <br/>
location, K-Star for the Dinner arrangements, and Brian of TGD for <br/>
the amazing event stamps - just when you think his carvings can't <br/>
get any better....they do!!<br/>
<br/>
We enjoyed meeting at least 27 new (to us) letterboxers, and <br/>
collecting numerous and fun Personal Travelers.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to a long weekend in Maine in a few weeks!</div>
