                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-579520613">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I was just looking at Sunday River Inn in Maine.  There is a note that <br/>
letterboxing starts on December, 18 "a chocolate reward each week".  A <br/>
reward?  I thought finding the box was reward enough, but I digress.<br/>
<br/>
We will be going up there for a long weekend in January.  Does anyone <br/>
know about this or possibly the clues?  I tried the website, but we <br/>
couldn't find any clues listed under Sunday River or Newry, ME.  Could <br/>
anyone help?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

I knew that the ski resort had some organized letterboxing, but I know nothing of the <br/>
clues. You're best bet is to call them direclty when you arrive or are heading out.<br/>
<br/>
There are some nearby boxes including the Lakes Region series, so there are many <br/>
boxes to find - best of luck at Sunday River and let us know how that turns out. If <br/>
there's chocolate involved, that sounds like a sweet deal!<br/>

long weekend along with my parents who have a timeshare at the Bethel <br/>
Inn.  I'm hoping to find some boxes in that area.  I'm wondering if the <br/>
box per week that the staffer is planting is on a cross country ski <br/>
track or if it's accessible via walking.  Never been cc-skiing before, <br/>
so that would be an interesting thing to do, especially trying to stamp <br/>
in while on two thin pieces of wood.  Hopefully it's not on a hill.<br/>
<br/>
Hope all is well and possibly see you on the trails.<br/>
