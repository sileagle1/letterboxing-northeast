The owner told me that this eagle has been coming back for the last 3 years for a few months in the winter.  I always have my backpack filled with maintenance supplies with me when I go hiking, which includes my camera.  I didn't bring it this time for some reason.  Probably because it was a new box that would have been in fine shape.  Murphy's Law...<br/>
