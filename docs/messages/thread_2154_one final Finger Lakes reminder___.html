Saturday June 11th, 11 am - 3 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
You want waterfalls? You want lakes? You want gorges that go on for miles? <br/>
You've got 'em in the Finger Lakes, plus plenty of breathtaking views and <br/>
all of the fun of the second sorta-annual Finger Lakes gathering.<br/>
<br/>
Bring your tastiest contribution to the potluck plus your clues for the <br/>
many boxes in and around Ithaca, and join us at 11 a.m. at this historic <br/>
location, formerly the "Hollywood of the East," at the southern tip of <br/>
Cayuga Lake. You may want to brush up on your cinematic history if you hope <br/>
to find the right park, the same one where the Wharton Brothers made their <br/>
headquarters early last century.<br/>
<br/>
Turn left when you enter the park, and be sure to observe the 10 mph speed <br/>
limit. We'll be at the smaller of the two pavilions - just look for either <br/>
of the two sets of revolving horses (one large and musical, the other small <br/>
and human-powered). There's even a playground very close at hand - <br/>
including fun of the most unexpected sorts - for attendees both young and <br/>
young at heart. So sorry, but four-legged friends are NOT allowed at this <br/>
gathering place.<br/>
<br/>
This lovely park has only one box listed in residence, but rumor has it <br/>
that a certain missing arboreal giant will be replaced in time for the <br/>
gathering. Expect that other newcomers may show as well. Plenty of other <br/>
boxes may be found in nearby locations, including Farm City Day, Farmer's <br/>
Market, Downstream Deliverance (soon to be retired - get it now!), Monster <br/>
Tamer, Taughannock Falls, Taughannock Falls Overlook, all of the boxes at <br/>
Six Mile Creek, Guardian Angel, Sackett's Bridge, Red, White and True, <br/>
Snoop Doggy, June Monsoon and a host of others (including one very special <br/>
Tompkins County mystery box that you must not miss, and another NY mystery <br/>
box that may be closer than you think).<br/>
<br/>
Come mingle with letterboxers from near and far as we enjoy each other's <br/>
company from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Don't forget to bring something to share for <br/>
the potluck, and extra clues for any boxes you'll be planting. (We expect <br/>
at least 65 attendees, so please bring plenty of copies.) You'll probably <br/>
want lots of bug spray, too, and maybe an umbrella if rain is forecast.<br/>
<br/>
We ask that HHs not be exchanged or left out on tables for others to stamp <br/>
into at the gathering. The spectacular I Love NY HH Hostel is only a 25 <br/>
minute drive away, and HHs are always welcome there. You're also welcome, <br/>
of course, to leave HHs in local boxes or to exchange them with other <br/>
letterboxers on the trail.<br/>

will be scarce due to Cornell's Reunion weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing many of you on Saturday!<br/>
