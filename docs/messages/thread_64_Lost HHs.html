August in SE Mass.  One was Harriet's hitchhiker and the other was <br/>
the J and A HH.  We heard about Harriet's HH - someone had found it <br/>
at the Cape Capper, but we have never had word about the J and A HH.  <br/>
So sad...if anyone has seen them, please let us know.  We would love <br/>
to hear of their travels!<br/>

there and I was going to post that we haven't heard from any of them <br/>
in awhile . But the Bird Stamper just posted to the HH list that she <br/>
picked up our L'il Vespa Scoot in CT today . There is one in <br/>
particular that I'm interested in knowing about , Moe Szslack ( yes , <br/>
the bartender on the Simpson's ) . If anybody has come across <br/>
him ,I'd love to hear from you . I know that we are guilty of <br/>
sometimes placing hitchers into some of the harder to find boxes , as <br/>
a special prize for the next finders of the box . Maybe if others are <br/>
doing this also , that is why it's seems that they disappear for long <br/>
periods of time . I know of some that I don't think have moved since <br/>
this time last year . Should we go and move them ? <br/>

down, and then once they have moved the HH to another box, they have <br/>
no way of getting in touch with me.  <br/>

Anyway, if any of you have seen any of my hitchhikers, I'd be glad to <br/>
know! They are at:<br/>
