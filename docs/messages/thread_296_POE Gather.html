                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1630256154">Wow!  What a great gather!  Thank you SO much Warrior Woman for putting <br/>
together such a great event!  Thanks also to Brian for the GREAT event <br/>
stamps!  THey were both wonderful!  You are such a great carver!<br/>
<br/>
It was so nice to see so many familiar faces, many of whom I haven't seen in <br/>
quite a while: Phyto, Isoceles, Teach and Preach, Jay Drew, Yachtsman, Mary <br/>
Manatee, Mary in RI, Safari Man etc... and many of whom I see on more of a <br/>
regular basis: some of the "Usual Suspects" (you know who you are ;-), and <br/>
lastly MANY who I had never met before!  I'm sure we all made lots of new <br/>
friends today!<br/>
<br/>
What was even more astonishing was the fact that there were a WHOLE BUNCH of <br/>
personal travelers!  Holy Cow!  THey have really become popular!  I even <br/>
found a couple of children walking around with PT's with questions I had to <br/>
answer before being able to stamp the stamp into my book!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to everyone who made the day possible!  I can't wait to try out <br/>
my new peach preserves from Farmer Harvey's farm!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing!<br/>

morning after a wonderful day of boxing with you folks at the Peace on<br/>
Earth Gathering. We enjoyed meeting Merenwen and Olwe and the<br/>
Weathergleams ...and finally putting faces with names! We also joined<br/>
the Spooky Group, Team Green Dragon and Solar and Binx for some<br/>
post-event pre-dinner boxing. Thanks Sadie and Russ!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Warrior Woman and Farmer Harvey for the location and<br/>
organization. Thanks Team Green Dragon for the AMAZING carving!!!<br/>
Thank you KStar for making reservations at Tweeds and Marke Pepe for<br/>
your infectious enthusiasm for this hobby! <br/>
<br/>
As if this wasn't quite enough for us to feast on after a long<br/>
winter's cold, the Maine March Gathering will be taking place on<br/>
Sunday, March 21st at the Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve at<br/>
Laudholm Farm. I hope many of you can make it to this upcoming event.<br/>
<br/>
Please check Silent Doug and Mark Pepe's pages for information. You<br/>
may also check out the Wells Reserve at: <a href="http://www.wellsreserve.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.wellsreserve.org</a><br/>
Please remember that there can't be any four legged friends at this<br/>
event. <br/>

Sorry, there will be no pets allowed at Wells, it's a national<br/>
research reserve and that should be posted to let others know as well.<br/>
I'm so sorry. I believe that Mark has posted some information since<br/>

</span></blockquote>Thanks - I'd dogsit if we still lived closer in our old house, but<br/>
alas- Bangor is too far away for that. It's just the reserve rules,<br/>
I'm surprised that Nautilus hasn't spoken up about that - it is just<br/>
one of those things - ya know, dogs and wildlife sometimes don't mesh.<br/>

If you guys plan on coming up on Saturday to do some boxing, I would<br/>
suggest Casco Bay Painter's new portland boxes the Canine Letterboxes<br/>

Forgive my silence on the subject of accommodations for the upcoming <br/>
gathering that Phyto and I are hosting, but I've been away for work <br/>
(hence having to miss the POE gathering). I have a few thoughts/comments <br/>
on accommodations.<br/>
First, the deal Mark has found sounds great. I've never been there <br/>
myself, but it sounds nice. It is however, not one, but two exits away <br/>
from Wells which is exit 2. It's still probably only about 25 minutes <br/>
away though.<br/>
Second, as some of you have discovered, many of the Wells, Kennebunk and <br/>
Ogunquit hotels are closed until April or May. There are a few I know of <br/>
that are open. Beach Farm Inn is a nice place that includes breakfast. I <br/>
think you can get a room for around $70. Juniper Hill Inn in Ogunquit is <br/>
also nice and I believe the rooms start at $60. Village By the Sea is <br/>
very posh. They have one or two bedroom suites for 4 people that range <br/>
from $75 to $115. I think in the two bedroom ones you can sleep 6 people <br/>
b/c of a pullout but there might be an additional charge. There is also <br/>
Quinney's Bed and Breakfast which is right down the road and is $65 with <br/>
a full breakfast. I don't know if they allow pets, but it's a mini farm <br/>
with a feed and seed store, so I'm assuming they do.<br/>
Just over the border of Wells in Sanford is the Super 8 motel. The AAA <br/>
rate for 2 people is $58 (single is $51). They allow pets, but there is <br/>
an additional charge.<br/>
I think that most, if not all, of these places are listed on the Wells <br/>
Chamber of Commerce website at www.wellschamber.org but if you have any <br/>
trouble finding any of them, I'd be happy to send you the phone number, <br/>
just contact me off list.<br/>
Also, as Phyto mentioned, unfortunately, pets are not allowed on Wells <br/>
Reserve property (that includes being left in the car). I would offer up <br/>
my house, but it's a half an hour away and I'm afraid my six cats might <br/>
be petrified by a dog! I'll check with a friend who lives right down the <br/>
road and see if he would mind if we maybe leashed up a dog for a bit at <br/>
his place.<br/>
