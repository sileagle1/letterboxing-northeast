First post here - I am pretty new to letterboxing, am loving it and figure this is a good <br/>
place to ask questions. I'm wondering if anyone has found "Rhodie" and "Atkinson Afro" in <br/>
Newburyport, MA. Because I know I was right there each time! So maybe I didn't <br/>
persevere enough? There are some lovely and creative boxes in that area - Gabrial <br/>
Weathervane, Touch and Go and Scales of Justice are especially distinctive. <br/>

( Tues I believe)<br/>
<br/>
Rhodie we did find....<br/>
Atkinson Afro clearly was MIA<br/>
As was Scales of Justice . nothing but a bottle with a TP logbook...<br/>
There was another in a park nearby that was also missing......<br/>
<br/>
I was curious if anyone had found YEAT lately.....<br/>
