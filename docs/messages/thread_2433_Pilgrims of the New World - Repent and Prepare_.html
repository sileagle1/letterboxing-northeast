wandering ways and return to the flock to be born anew.<br/>
<br/>
I shall gather my weary followers just five days before our fellow pilgrims <br/>
and Indian brethren offer thanks for a successful harvest.  We shall not <br/>
meet in Plimouth as our forefathers did but will travel North to the village <br/>
of the Kings in the land settled by Roger Williams to avoid religious <br/>
persecution.  We shall seek shelter there in the community structure named <br/>
for the frigid waters erupting from the ground by the waters named for our <br/>
Indian brothers.<br/>
<br/>
Arise, arise, I say and prepare yourselves for the upcoming event.  Open <br/>
your heart and your larder.  Come with rubber carvings and edible offerings <br/>
to share with fellow seekers of the mystic path.  No one who undertakes this <br/>
journey will be turned away with an unfilled journal or an empty belly.  For <br/>
it is only if we cast aside our individual wants that we can join in the <br/>
eternal pursuit of the penultimate visage.<br/>
<br/>
Part of your earthly reward shall be a host of angels hidden to greet my <br/>
wayward flock.  Let those among you who can capture their divine image be <br/>
known to me.  Those who embrace redemption shall journey forward with a <br/>
journal full of heavenly imprints.<br/>
<br/>
For those who seek divine intervention in determining the path to redemption <br/>
may seek guidance from me.<br/>
