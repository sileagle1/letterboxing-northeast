                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-139330275">Hi everyone -<br/>
<br/>
We found a box while at the Thompson Dam planting for Where the Wild Things Are.  We were on the upper west side on the Ravenelle Pond Loop.  Problem is, I cannot find any clues associated with this box.  It is an older loop - the book with it says THIS SIDE Book #2 and has dates back to 2004 &amp; 2005 (and one find in 2008).  It's a green logbook and has green ink and the stamp is of a man.<br/>
<br/>
We took the box with us because it was laying out in the middle of no where with no obvious hiding spot nearby.  There is no planter listed anywhere on the box or logbook.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone recognize this or remember where it belongs so we can put it back in it's right spot?</div>

Of course, looking at it quickly, there are 9 boxes in all and we may have planted on top of some (since we didn't have the clues and didn't see any up there - we really were not looking).  WIll have to put it back now and see if we can find the other 8 (if they are still there!)!  <br/>

It was an old Teach and Preach box!  I love finding old no longer listed items!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi everyone -<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We found a box while at the Thompson Dam planting for Where the Wild Things Are. We were on the upper west side on the Ravenelle Pond Loop. Problem is, I cannot find any clues associated with this box. It is an older loop - the book with it says THIS SIDE Book #2 and has dates back to 2004 &amp; 2005 (and one find in 2008). It's a green logbook and has green ink and the stamp is of a man.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We took the box with us because it was laying out in the middle of no where with no obvious hiding spot nearby. There is no planter listed anywhere on the box or logbook.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does anyone recognize this or remember where it belongs so we can put it back in it's right spot?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
