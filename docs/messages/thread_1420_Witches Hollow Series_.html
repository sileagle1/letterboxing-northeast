finished the Witches Hollow series at Chatfield Hollow! We started on <br/>
Friday afternoon. There are 4 hikes ranging in length from 1/2 mile <br/>
to 2 miles. There are a total of 5 boxes in the series, though we <br/>
never found the Staircase LB. In 4 of the boxes are 4 clues to a 6th <br/>
box (thankfully there wasn't a clue in the one we couldn't find!), <br/>
where a treasure awaits, which we were thrilled to find! We were <br/>
exhausted, as this is serious hiking but it felt great! I recommend <br/>
this series, it was great, although I wouldn't have done it alone <br/>
with my daughter. Having another adult to help manuever the course <br/>
was extremely helpful! Beautiful scenery on every stretch! Check it <br/>
out!<br/>
