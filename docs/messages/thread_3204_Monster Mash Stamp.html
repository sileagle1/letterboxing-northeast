<br/>
It was a black stamp of a scary face, planted on the same trail as Rub a Dub Dub in Mansfield Depot.  The other two MMM boxes on the same trail were Heat Miser and Oogie Boogie.<br/>

Does anyone know the name of this box?<br/>

trail.  It is 3 7/8" high and 2 3/4" wide, and also there were bat <br/>
stickers in the box.  It was Pumpkin Head's Head by Sew Sew Bizzy.<br/>
