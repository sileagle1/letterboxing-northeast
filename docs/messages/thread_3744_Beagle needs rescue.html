Hello Boxers of the northeast,I have a beautiful female beagle<br/>
currently staying with me,I rescued her from the streets where she was<br/>
carelessly abandoned and am searching for a home for her.She is VERY<br/>
sweet,has not barked at all,is friendly to everyone she's met as well<br/>
as other dogs.If you would like to give her a home email me soon.I<br/>
have contacted quite a few rescue groups in the area looking for a<br/>
foster home or perhaps a forever home,I dont have the heart to put her<br/>
in a shelter,she's had it rough enough already.If I didnt have 3 dogs<br/>
already I would keep her myself,she is such a sweetheart!!<br/>

<br/>
That is so good of you to keep her until you can find her a home.  I <br/>
contacted a friend of mine who breeds beagles to see if she knows <br/>
anyone who can take her.  <br/>
<br/>
posting on petfinder is a good idea too.<br/>
<br/>
good luck.  I will let you know if my friend has any advice.<br/>
