<br/>
   For the past 6 or so weeks a group of us aka Mansfield <br/>
Maintenance Crew having been checking up on Leader of the Packs <br/>
boxes . At last count she had over 75 boxes just in Mansfield . My <br/>
original intend was to just check the Mansfield boxes for LOTP as <br/>
she is having foot problems ............<br/>
<br/>
    Well I am happy to report that with the help of the Maintenance <br/>
Crew which includes one famous dog, we have almost completed our <br/>
mission. To date we have checked 114 of LOTP boxes in Connecticut .<br/>
We have changed baggies, removed full logbooks, replaced new <br/>
logbooks, added outer baggies , rewrapped in paper towels and <br/>
recarved broken or missing stamps. <br/>
<br/>
   We have discovered that 3 of LOTP's boxes were accidently deleted <br/>
from the LNBA site . Mark is working to get these 3 back on <br/>
line .Thank you .<br/>
<br/>
   WE have restored the 17 BOX ( yes 17 boxes ) Kettle Hole Series <br/>
and the new clues for the missing boxes should be updated soon . <br/>
Thank you JUDY in New Zealand ( she is the webmaster for LOTP"s web <br/>
page)<br/>
<br/>
   WE are currently working on restoring the WONDERFUL  Gazebo <br/>
series . Music Woman has recarved the missing pieces and Flutterby <br/>
has volunteered to rehide them in less obvious places . Watch for <br/>
that announcement .<br/>
<br/>
   The group is a hard working group and as you can see we have <br/>
branched out of Mansfield and our goal is to report on all her boxes <br/>
in Connecticut. WE would also like to replace some of the older <br/>
boxes that went missing a few years back .<br/>
<br/>
   More to come <br/>
<br/>
A HUGE THANK YOU  to the Mansfield Maintenance Crew for restoring <br/>
Mansfield's Letterboxing Title and helping the "godmother " of <br/>
letterboxing .<br/>
