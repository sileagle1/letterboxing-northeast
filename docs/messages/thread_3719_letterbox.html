discover our little pastime accidentally like this.<br/>
<br/>
What I suggest is first that you get yourself a personal rubber stamp and  <br/>
stamp in to the logbook and leave a little note. If the logbook contains the  <br/>
email address of the person who planted it, you can safely send them a note  <br/>
telling them you've found it.<br/>
<br/>
Then, if you can, try and re-hide the letterbox exactly as you found  it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for caring for this little treasure! Jay in CT<br/>

I found a letterbox in our community garden as  I was weeding last summer. I <br/>
did not know what it was so I put it away and  then forgot where I put it. A <br/>
few weeks later some ladies approached me and  asked if I had come across the <br/>
box. I said yes but did not remember where it  was.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I just found it again, this time I have it in my apartment.  <br/>
<br/>
What should I do with it?<br/>
<br/>
It was found in the Neighbors Garden  Community Garden in LOGAN SQUARE last <br/>
summer of 2007.<br/>
