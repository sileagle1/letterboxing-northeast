carved stamp.  Even with the 1/32" bit I use.  If it could, then the US Mint<br/>
would not produce note and coin plates by hand.  They still carve by hand.<br/>
<br/>
I was looking into a system that uses a photographic process similar to silk<br/>
screen production.<br/>
There was about a $2,000 start up cost for the ultraviolet "oven" and the<br/>
related materials.  If there was a market it could pay for itself fairly<br/>
quickly.  The down side to that process was the need to gang up about 10-12<br/>
stamps to efficiently use the stock size of the stamp material.  That could<br/>
cause delays in orders being shipped.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if there are any YouTube videos about this topic?<br/>

I've carved sig stamps for 4 friends, which I would never consider actually charging them for.  However, if I were to put a price on them . . . the more detailed stamps I've made take about 8 to 10 hours to design, carve and fine tune.  Materials cost what? $2 for 1/2 a sheet of the Pink Stuff?  That's not the issue here.  If I were to put a price on a 10 hour stamp, I'd probably charge someone in the range of $50.  I think you're fooling yourself if you think you can get more.  It's not exactly a highly sought after trade and considering you can buy a precarved stamp in a store for what, $5, I think that kind of mark-up is resonable for a custom design.<br/>

here is his reply:<br/>
=========================================<br/>
I'm not a member of the Northeast board, but Wisconsin Hiker <br/>
forwarded your Email to me.<br/>
<br/>
I've talked with her before about possibly selling some of my stamps, <br/>
or doing stamps for hire basis. This will give you some idea of my <br/>
work, <a href="http://hartx6carving.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://hartx6carving.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
I figure I don't want to get in over my head and have order after <br/>
order to fill (as that would take the joy out of carving and make it <br/>
a chore), but it would be nice to make a little money to put back <br/>
into my "Letterboxing kitty".<br/>
<br/>
I figure for my stamps I would have a base price of $5 then $1 dollar <br/>
for every hour I worked on the stamp... plus shipping.<br/>
<br/>
All of the "portraits" I have pictured on my site are 2.5" x 1.5" and <br/>
take me between 5 - 10 hours to carve. So with a base price of $5 + <br/>
$1 per hour one of the portraits would run someone between $15 - $20 <br/>
per stamp.<br/>
<br/>
This may sound a bit high, but look at what they charge for a rubber <br/>
stamp at Michaels. I feel this is a reasonable price.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and make sure they know that this being a hand carved stamp may <br/>
not be *perfect* every stamp I've carved there is something I wish I <br/>
did differently, some small infraction . . . well, what they pay for <br/>
is what you give them, so long as it is acceptable to you.<br/>
