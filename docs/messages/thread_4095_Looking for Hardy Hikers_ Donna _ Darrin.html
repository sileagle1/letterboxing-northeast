rebuilt a section of wall and will be deleting the clues for that box. I<br/>
would really like to find it and relocate it away from the wall, so if<br/>
anyone has found the box "acorn" from that series and can help me out,<br/>
please send me an email. The clues were the left stone wall, north side,<br/>
near an oak tree, if that rings a bell (unfortunately it is all oaks along<br/>
the wall for a few hundred feet).<br/>
