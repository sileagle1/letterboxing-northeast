I found one box in Vermont while on my way: Graveyard (sniff sniff.... <br/>

I attempted a box in Mont Tremblant, which was unfortunately missing.  <br/>
I also attempted two boxes in Quebec CIty, one of which was long gone, <br/>

Sniff..... two words..... ROAD TRIP!).  I did find Quebec's Stairs <br/>

I can't wait to go back!  Perhaps I'll get back in September for a <br/>
