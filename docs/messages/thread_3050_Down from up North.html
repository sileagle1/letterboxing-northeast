While we didn't do everything we wanted to we did get to the things that needed doing.<br/>
:(  Poutine is no longer in its tree. So now Dave and I will be free to plant our own Poutine Letterbox. :)  TBA<br/>
:(  We checked on Stairs with a View and it might also be MIA. Will the next travellers to Quebec City also check on this box as well (even if you already got the box previously). I believe the planter lives down in the Mid-atlantic region so she can't check on it very often.<br/>
:) On a much happier note, Tour St. Francois on Ile d'Orleans is in fine repair. Only about 3 pilgrims have been able to visit this box since we planted it. But, the box was intact and dry! <br/>
:)  We also visited The Ants Go Marching... in Cabot, VT on the way to Middlebury, VT. We only had a day to drive home from Canada, so we went with drivebys that were on the way to Middlebry and then RI. This box was in fine shape as well. Nice spot - We like Cabot. Their Cooperative Dairy saved alot of Vermont Farms and they went on to becom Agrimark and help save alot of New England Dairy farms. Drink Local Milk!<br/>
Finally we were able to get to Middlebury, VT and put a new logbook in the Otter Creek LB. Please remember how important it is to hide boxes well. I would rather spend time looking for a box that IS there instead of a box that WAS there. Someone had walked off with  the logbook and the blue brush pen. Funny thing - they left the stamp and the gold ink pad! The last finders - The Winslows from Vermont - did the best they could after finding the box out in the open and the pieces scattered. It was their first box - how diappointing!  Thanks guys. If you'd like to go back the box is now compleat. Thnks to veryone who visited the box, but unfortunately the logbook is gone - probably thrown into the Otter Creek by some partying teenagers. We do realize that this spot is a party spot, but the first spot we found out is under water most of the time! In fact, today (High Summer) the stump we used to use as a benchmark was surrounded by a raging river! Let's hope this box lasts a bit longer.<br/>
