<br/>
Its me. Talking Turtle again. sorry to BOMBARD the lists with e-mails,<br/>
but I have e-mails coming in left and right about the Clue Exchange<br/>
Game.   So I thought it best to address everyone's questions at once<br/>
<br/>
Please bear with me, as I have never hosted the Clue Exchange game .<br/>
well to be quite honest. I've never actually played the board game Clue<br/>
either.. Hey. I was an only kid. board games just aren't as fun by<br/>
yourself, although I have played all 4 colors of Sorry! By myself. what<br/>
a case of self loathing that creates LOL  <br/>
<br/>
#1  While I will have the pieces carved for the original Clue Exchange<br/>
game played at the gathering last May, those are reserved for those who<br/>
arrive and decide they want to play that day, and therefore don't have a<br/>
piece.<br/>
<br/>
#2  The theme of the pieces if you decide to carve one or more, will<br/>
be.. what else? Fear Factor and Letterboxing.  To give you an example,<br/>
So far we have:<br/>
<br/>
Suspect                        Weapon                        Location<br/>
Carver <br/>
Apolonia Trailenheffer     Cow entrail rope             Out-house<br/>
Talking Turtle<br/>
Rocky M. Ountainside    Poisonous snail darts     Abandoned Well<br/>
Blax<br/>
Sheleda B. Foolishly      Killer bee hive                Up a tree<br/>
Gizmo<br/>
<br/>
#3  It would be best (most convenient) for the Clue Master to have all<br/>
the stamps prior to the gathering, as there is some preparation<br/>
involved. I'll have a LOT to do that Saturday morning.  <br/>
<br/>
#4 If anyone would like to take over the duties of Clue Master please do<br/>
not hesitate to let me know.  Scarab and I will coach you.<br/>
<br/>
#5 For those who have never played clue, the basic concept is that from<br/>
a blind pool, a suspect, weapon and location are chosen.  The remaining<br/>
stamps are then shuffled again and passed out to those playing.  The<br/>
object is to exchange stamps with everyone playing until you can figure<br/>
out which ones are missing from the original pool.  Once you think you<br/>
know the correct missing pieces, you DISCREETLY whisper it to the Clue<br/>
Master.  The winners will not be announced until 1st, 2nd and 3rd places<br/>
have been confirmed.  Prizes will be awarded then.<br/>
<br/>
That covers all the questions that have come up so far this afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you all there!<br/>
<br/>
