I have started getting the e-mail I thought I would be getting when I saw the <br/>
four days of snow ahead.  I would not want any one to be crazy and drive up <br/>
here for a gathering in such bad conditions, so with much thought I am <br/>
changeing the date of the gathering to April 3rd.  I am sorry to anyone who <br/>
has made reservations already but i am doing this for everyones safety.  April <br/>
3rd I am hoping will bring good weather and an extra hour of day light.  <br/>
Please e-mail me with any questions and I hope all of you will still be able to <br/>
make it up then.<br/>

</span></blockquote>From where I sit in Maine, It looks like in April we might still be<br/>
measuring our snow in feet! will it ever melt? sure and then comes the<br/>
floods and the mud.... ahhh springtime in Maine. Don't get me wrong, I<br/>
am not 'whingeing'; there is many reasons to live in and love Maine,<br/>
but the month of March generally isn't one of them!<br/>
<br/>
Lets hope April 3 works for you (and us)!<br/>
