<br/>
We just dropped our first letterbox  in a nice scenic area on the East Side of <br/>
Providence.  Nice, easy stroll and a great place to get ice cream, too.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the link on the letterboxing.org web-site:<br/>

<br/>
The box is called Max's Minute.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

They can be mosquitoful at dusk, but the Cannons takes her by WWII observation areas of the bay (from the island, it's a nice vantage) and the Sanctuary observation platforms puts one up close to the egrets.  On the road past Canonicut Cannons is Beavertail Lighthouse.  It's a great place to soak in a real New Englandy rockshore, but I'd disrecommend the Beavertail Light or Loss of a Friend letterboxes for your Mum - an incredible view awaits *after* a strenuous walk of some distance, and the poison ivy is in full force.<br/>
    Wickford, Washington County, is very pleasant.  The Faces of Wickford gives a lovely stroll in a sheltered harbor town (though the last of the four is missing).  It's not too touristy, even though it's the Witches of Eastwick village.<br/>

driving to RI tomorrow, but would still appreciate any other boxing <br/>

the state anyway, so any location is fine. :-)<br/>
