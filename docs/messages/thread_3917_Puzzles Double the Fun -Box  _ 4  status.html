of this series (planted by Carolyn back in 9/01). It was somewhat <br/>
exposed and the logbook is damp, but still readable.  I brought the <br/>
box home to give it some T.L.C. and will replant it soon. Years ago <br/>
when hunting for these boxes, I was never able to get beyond box #1, <br/>
so now am encouraged to try for the  rest. <br/>
