</span></blockquote>Lamoine is indeed off of Route 1 if you're coming back from the Bar<br/>
Harbor/Ellsworth area. There was a box there placed by Gaiagirls a<br/>
while  back I believe. Someone poasted about it being at a campsite<br/>
that was not accessible by driving through. I'm not sure what happened<br/>
to that box, but we'll let you know if we check on it at some point.<br/>
<br/>
Lamoine State Park is a short drive off the main route, but well worth<br/>
the scenery...as are some more of the coastal routes from 1 such as<br/>
Gouldsboro, Franklin and the Schoodic area. Less hectic than the drive<br/>
to Acadia.<br/>
