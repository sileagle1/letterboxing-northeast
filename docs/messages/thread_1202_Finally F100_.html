                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-647388984">I finally made it to MA and did some boxing on Saturday. Here's a report on <br/>
the 20 I found:<br/>
<br/>
I started off with Night Song in Needham, and then collected the Noanet <br/>
series (all 3) in Dover. Next, I took a tour of Rocky Woods/Fork Factory <br/>
Brook and found all 4 of Cavy Lovers' boxes there. (Cavy Lovers -- I <br/>
stamped the last page of the Star Flower log; folks can start stamping on <br/>
the backs of earlier pages, but you might want to replace it.)<br/>
<br/>
Then I found 6 in Bird Park in Walpole: Loose Goose, Spring Leaf, Crows at <br/>
Bird Park, Weeping Willow, Cheeseburger Challenge and Happy Birthday, Baby! <br/>
(The driving directions for many of these are off -- the turn at the T is <br/>
not onto Old Post Road, but Pleasant St. -- at least, that's the street <br/>
sign that you see. The street apparently changes names at this intersection.)<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I wrapped up the day with the 5 at Moose Hill Audubon Sanctuary: <br/>
Fertile Frond, Trillium and the Moose Hill series (all 3). Two of the Moose <br/>
Hill series boxes were left exposed and not properly restored (logs in <br/>
baggies, etc.) by a group of day campers who had visited the boxes in the <br/>
prior week or so. I put them all back properly.<br/>
<br/>
Very cool -- as dusk approached at the end of my hiking in Moose Hill, I <br/>
heard a coyote call and then several others responded from a distance. Then <br/>
I spotted one on the road about 75 yards in front of me.<br/>
<br/>
I also picked up The Raven hitchhiker at the Cavorting Cavy box and moved <br/>
it along on Sunday, and dropped off another hitchhiker along the way.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all you Mass boxers!<br/>
<br/>
Doug<br/>

following:<br/>
<br/>
I started with the DEP American Legion State Forest and DEP People's State <br/>
Forest in Barkhamstead, and found them without a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Then I met up with Jennifer and we took off together. In and around <br/>
Litchfield, we found the DEP Topsmead State Forest, The Twins Series (both, <br/>
lots of water in the first one but the log was dry), Corrina Lynn and Tammy <br/>
Ann.<br/>
<br/>
Then we found Tom's Snobbery Series (all 4) and the DEP Mattatuck State <br/>
Forest in Watertown, and ended the day with the DEP Paugussett State Forest <br/>
and Upper Paugussett boxes in Newtown. We picked up the Lone Wolf <br/>
Hitchhiker in the Upper Paugussett box, too.  The DEP box in Paugussett was <br/>
the 5th DEP box for us both.<br/>
<br/>
We dropped off a hitchhiker along the way and found some bonus boxes, too, <br/>
making for a productive few hours of letterboxing!<br/>

Actually...Silent Doug, this boxing trip sounds like something I could just dream about! I think my highest on any given day was four and that included a lot of complaining from my boys. (I've nicknamed them the Wa Wa Brotherhood! I really should make a stamp for that!)<br/>
<br/>
I'm so excited someone found one of my boxes! <br/>
