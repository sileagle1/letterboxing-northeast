<br/>
If you are going on the drive on Sunday, here are some updates for you:<br/>
<br/>
1.  I have made a list of directions from box to box that everyone who is <br/>
willing to drive should print out to have with them.  That way, in case we get <br/>
lost, nobody is totally lost.  Know what I mean?  I'm going to post it to this <br/>
list later tonight, but first, I'm going out to check the directions and make <br/>
sure they work.  Kind of important.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
2.  There are 31 boxes on this loop!  To save time, we're going to have one <br/>
communal stamp-in stamp.  Also, Brian (Team Green Dragon) is making an event <br/>
stamp.  :)<br/>
<br/>
That's all for now...  <br/>
<br/>
Mark, can you please send me the list of who has RSVPd to you?<br/>

you say we would have to drive?  Only kidding!  I'm very excited <br/>
about this. Love the communal stamp idea. <br/>

If anyone is interested, Warcat '76 have personal travelers.  Clues <br/>
are listed under New Jersey mystery or just put in NJ and then Warcat.<br/>

people had come from not only Connecticut, but also Massachusetts, Rhode <br/>
Island, New Hampshire, New York and New Jersey to participate.  Amazing!<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank everyone who made the drive a success.  :)  You guys made my <br/>
day.  I truly hope you all enjoyed it as much as I did!  Even though I already <br/>
had most of the stamps, it was so fun to take you all around and show you <br/>
some of the special places (and boxes) that Hartford County has to offer.  :)  <br/>
And the scenery was gorgeous!  (I'm thinking specifically here of Aqueduct.  If <br/>
you have a chance, look at Mark's website tonight.  That picture of the ice on <br/>
the waterfall is one that we saw today!  So pretty...  So "New England in <br/>
winter.")<br/>
<br/>
We're thinking of doing another one next month, so please email me privately <br/>
if you have any feedback to keep in mind.  :)  This was the first event of its <br/>
kind ever, and from what I understand, a good time was had by all!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1323102589">Well, at about 9:30 last night at a gas station on the CT/RI border, I<br/>
had abouto 3/4 of a bottle of Starbuck's Mocha Frappachino, which kept<br/>
me up until 12am, and while I tried writing about my adventure<br/>
yesterday, something strange happened to my computer, and I couldn't<br/>
finish it up (the keyboard was whacky)...anyways...hopefully the<br/>
computer will be nice to me this morning.<br/>
<br/>
First of, despite the cold, this was A BLAST!!! I recommend we do a<br/>
repeat performance in February, and if you were not able to go to this<br/>
one, I recommend you go next time!!!<br/>
<br/>
My day started at 6am, and got ready and Pigtographer and I were off<br/>
to Meriden at about 7am!  We arrived there around 8:40 and met up with<br/>
a few people, got the event stamps, exchanges, personal travelers, and<br/>
the like.  I also got the new LbNE patch!  When the Pepes arrived,<br/>
they had an announcement...two recently transplanted friends were<br/>
coming from Pennsylvania...and it was none other than Silent Doug and<br/>
Jennifer themselves!<br/>
<br/>
So after a frenzy of chatting and stamping, we piled into about 8 vans<br/>
and were off!<br/>
<br/>
I found:<br/>
<br/>
~I-84 Rest Stop, Southington, CT (there were a few travellers looking<br/>
at 50 people converge upon a a single wooded area! Hahaha...)<br/>
~Shooting Star, Farmington, CT (There is a sign across the street from<br/>
this letterboxing that says "The Exchange"...maybe a good group photo<br/>
op for the future?)<br/>
~Aqueduct, Farmington, CT (the frozen river/lake was amazing!)<br/>
~Jonathan's Dream, West Hartford, CT (Group photos, hot chocolate and<br/>
cookies!  I think this made up for the box being frozen under ice!)<br/>
~Would You Like to Swing on a Star?, West Hartford, CT (Silent Doug's<br/>
singing days came out here as he crooned with Bing Crosby! hahaha...)<br/>
~Pinchot Sycamore, Simsbury, CT (I highly, highly recommend this box -<br/>
the stamp is great, but the largest tree in all of Connecticut is<br/>
right across the street!  The tree is absolutely amazing...I must've<br/>
taken 10 pictures of it.)<br/>
~Jeffrey O. Phelps, Simsbury, CT (thank you to rtrw for giving out<br/>
some hand carved stamps to plant elsewhere!! Also, a woman came out<br/>
who was in charge of the museum and was talking to a few people about<br/>
how she got into letterboxing!  I liked the old houses and the 19th<br/>
century carriages and open sleighs.)<br/>
~Farmington Valley Greenway North, Simsbury, CT (see comments above)<br/>
~Traveler's Tower, Hartford, CT (the view from here was incredible,<br/>
seeing the skyline of the city! We found the BAM! HH in this box.  Not<br/>
sure who wound up taking it with them.)<br/>
~Mark Twain, Hartford, CT (this place was great and so was the stamp.<br/>
 Maybe if those leatherbound journals were a bit cheaper I would of<br/>
snagged one. And Pigtographer bought some patchouli...hahaha...)<br/>
~Soldier's &amp; Sailor's Memorial Arch, Hartford, CT (this place<br/>
was...magnificent!  So magnificent I stopped mid-walk in the middle of<br/>
the street to gawk at it!  Good thing somebody yelled that there was a<br/>
car coming right at me...the adventures you have when you letterbox!)<br/>
~Coins of the Lane, Silver Lane, and Soaring Eagle, East Hartford, CT<br/>
(this was our last pit stop of the day and was it fun! A few of the<br/>
neighbors on the cul-de-sac were looking out their windows wondering<br/>
what in the world was going on...not only did this happen but Phynstar<br/>
hit F1000, I believe!)<br/>
<br/>
After our long day, we headed off to Music Woman's house for some<br/>
coffee, tea, hot chocolate and some snacks...where we also swapped<br/>
some more stories!  Also saw a parasite moving about in a HH too!<br/>
<br/>
After we left her house, we were off to Central Pizza, which according<br/>
to somebody was "down the street"...hm...maybe being a Rhode Islander,<br/>
my conception of "down the street" is ACTUALLY down the street?  Only<br/>
kidding around.  The company and stamping and food was very good, and<br/>
I know that I can vouch for everyone in saying that this was a great<br/>
success and should definitely be repeated in the future.<br/>
<br/>
And now for a long list of thanks...<br/>
<br/>
Wolfy (for having the patches available to buy), Phyto (while she<br/>
might not have been there, the patch design is incredible), The<br/>
McLeans and Pudding Beth (for sharing their stories and letting us<br/>
ride around Connecticut with them), Silent Doug and Jennifer (for also<br/>
sharing a great deal of stories and laughs on the ride there, and for<br/>
the letterboxing.info stickers!), Music Woman (for opening your house<br/>
to 25-30 people! You are very kind (and very brave) to allow everyone<br/>
to have a rest between boxing and dinner), to Pine Tree (for<br/>
coordinating the caravan of minivans), and also to everybody else who<br/>
we met, greeted and swapped stories with.<br/>
<br/>
Am I forgetting somebody??<br/>
<br/>
No, I don't think so, oh, wait:<br/>
<br/>
To three very talented people, the coordinators of this entire thing,<br/>
Chrissy, and Mark and Sue Pepe!! You guys did a wonderful job with<br/>
this event, planning, coordinating, and everything in between.  It<br/>
went extremely well.  Thank you very much!!<br/>
<br/>
If I forgot you, don't be miffed...it's still early (for me) and I'm<br/>
sorry if I missed you.<br/>
<br/>
And also, we missed you Butterfly! Hope you're feeling better, and<br/>
happy birthday!<br/>

organizing this event.  Sorry that you could not make it due to <br/>
illness - we missed you.  Goalie Girl and I did end up going after <br/>
all for a little while.  Had to scoot out early to run errands and <br/>
get home to put my house back together (we painted and had carpets <br/>
cleaned this week so many things out of place).  But we managed to <br/>
get 15 boxes by lunchtime and some exchanges plus the event stamp.  <br/>
It was so nice to see some familiar faces again and to meet some new <br/>
trail friends as well.  A BIG THANK YOU to Flutterby's husband for <br/>
getting my van unstuck in the parking lot.  It doesn't do well in <br/>
the snow (and there was ice under the snow).  Thanks also to Music <br/>
Woman for keeping us organized in Chrissy's place.  This was my <br/>
first time boxing in the winter.  IT can be pretty tricky finding <br/>
some of the locations under the snow.  <br/>
<br/>
Take care.  When is the SPRING boxing drive?????<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-59356654">We decided at 7:45 this morning to go to the Winter Boxing Drive today! We quickly rushed to get dressed an gather all necessary paraphenalia (which isn't always so quick with Mr. Safety around!) and stopped at Dunkin Donuts for coffee and breakfast!<br/>
<br/>
This was our first gathering, and since starting boxing last June we have only met 3 people while boxing, so it was nice to finally put faces to names! We enjoyed ourselves very much and it was a pleasure to meet all of you!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to Flutterby and her family for welcoming us all into her home. Chrissy did a great job coordinating and Music Woman was so wonderful at keeping things going! Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
We left the group after leaving Flutterby's house (our journal LOADED with exchanges!), as we already had the next few on teh 'to do' list. We headed over to Lebanon Lions Soccer and  were pleasently surprised! Thanks Queen B.<br/>
<br/>
As we headed out of town on our way home, we stopped at the Exeter Cemetery for a Hot Cocoa break and snack. A State Police Officer pulled up along side us and asked if we were the "Mischevious Geo Cachers". We politely said, '"No, letterboxers, but why?" Apparently we had stirred suspision from a nearby neighbor while boxing in a tiny little spot not far from Queen B's house!!! The neighbor had described our car and he found us! He checked out the area where we had been snooping, found the box and left his "Hello from the State Police" in the log book! We explained letterboxing and that tohers might be around this afternoon, in case he got more calls! Too Funny!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, we are such a delinquent little group!<br/>

Did anyone get a head count today ??  We were on a tight time frame so I <br/>
missed visiting with folks.  So sorry to have missed getting exchanges.  <br/>
Bluebird , Hiker Lou and I stopped at Flutterby's house and we were too <br/>
early :-( so I missed getting to meet and greet and yes--eat !!  Next <br/>
time around I will catch JBean  for an exchange and any others I have <br/>
missed.  It was a beautiful day and I hope you all had fun in Lebanon.<br/>

&gt; today! We quickly rushed to get dressed an gather all necessary <br/>
&gt; paraphenalia (which isn't always so quick with Mr. Safety around!) and <br/>
&gt; stopped at Dunkin Donuts for coffee and breakfast!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This was our first gathering, and since starting boxing last June we <br/>
&gt; have only met 3 people while boxing, so it was nice to finally put <br/>
&gt; faces to names! We enjoyed ourselves very much and it was a pleasure <br/>
&gt; to meet all of you!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you to Flutterby and her family for welcoming us all into her <br/>
&gt; home. Chrissy did a great job coordinating and Music Woman was so <br/>
&gt; wonderful at keeping things going! Thanks!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We left the group after leaving Flutterby's house (our journal LOADED <br/>
&gt; with exchanges!), as we already had the next few on teh 'to do' list. <br/>
&gt; We headed over to Lebanon Lions Soccer and  were pleasently surprised! <br/>
&gt; Thanks Queen B.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As we headed out of town on our way home, we stopped at the Exeter <br/>
&gt; Cemetery for a Hot Cocoa break and snack. A State Police Officer <br/>
&gt; pulled up along side us and asked if we were the "Mischevious Geo <br/>
&gt; Cachers". We politely said, '"No, letterboxers, but why?" Apparently <br/>
&gt; we had stirred suspision from a nearby neighbor while boxing in a tiny <br/>
&gt; little spot not far from Queen B's house!!! The neighbor had described <br/>
&gt; our car and he found us! He checked out the area where we had been <br/>
&gt; snooping, found the box and left his "Hello from the State Police" in <br/>
&gt; the log book! We explained letterboxing and that tohers might be <br/>
&gt; around this afternoon, in case he got more calls! Too Funny!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh, we are such a delinquent little group!<br/>

Due to both me and Stacy having to get to rehearsal was wanted to get as much boxing in as possible.  So after the Sunny Day series we headed out on our own and did the boxes in our own little order.  We didnt get all of then, only 27, but still a lot for one day.  However when we did the Bear Tracks/Lebanon Loop #4, Stacy forgot something in the car and went back to get it.  Right next to the road was a huge ditch covered by snow that she tripped in and thankfully was able to break her fall with her hands and (already bad) knees which are all bruised up.  Then with a truck tearing down the road she needed to get up and try and move out of the way.  In the process of seeing the truck coming she obviously got scared and tried to instrintively whip herself out of the way.  So now not she has aching back/hands/knees...but i guess it could have been worse.<br/>

<br/>
What a great day... after much enthusiasm at 5:00 Saturday and FAR less 6:30 AM Sunday when the Baby Bandits had to get up, we made the 1 hour 45 minute trek to Wallingford to meet up with Kreepy Kelli and family then on to Lebanon.<br/>
<br/>
We had a blast!  (Thanks Flutterby... the kids are still talking about Baby D, "No we're getting another dog").  I think we got all the boxes except the first set at Bartlett (sp?) Brook...  and even had a Baby Bandit save the day at Scoville Castle....<br/>
<br/>
Talking Turtle:  "Stop kicking that rock!  You'll make the whole wall collapse and then we'll have to stand out her in the cold while YOU rebuild it!"<br/>
<br/>
Daring Dragonfly:  "Mommy, The box is under there..."<br/>
<br/>
Talking Turtle:  "No it's not, QueenB just looked, its her box, don't you think she would know?!?"<br/>
<br/>
Daring Dragonfly:  "But Mommy, its there, I know it!"<br/>
<br/>
Talking Turtle: "'They just spent 20 minutes looking for the box... It's gone alright!  Didn't I say sto....."  <br/>
<br/>
Daring Dargonfly:  "Hey!  Mommy look a letterbox!"<br/>
<br/>
Talking Turtle: "DANG!  Musta inherited the gift from her father"<br/>
<br/>
And the children shall lead... Why don't I ever have that kind of luck?  <br/>
<br/>
I did get something besides stamps out of yesterday!  A broken finger!  I crushed the tip of my right pinky when I smashed it between two rocks at one of the cemteries... Exeter I think...  By the time we got home around 8:30 last night, the first two joints had turned a lovely shade of purple...close to Eggplant I'd say... fat as a sausage link... the nail base and half the bed are an interesting combination of red, black and yellow with just a hint of pink.  Its currently resting comfortably in on a splint which is going to have to come off, I have laundry to do since I avoided all housework yesterday in lieu of a day of winter boxing ... Do you have any idea how hard it is to type without the use of your pinky?<br/>
<br/>
More snow on the way... booo... hiss...  Have fun!<br/>

The incident with the Trooper was funny.  I guess some neighbor <br/>
thought we were up to no good.  I sent a note to one of my friends <br/>
at State Police to tell them about it.  I guess we are not a threat <br/>
to the stability of our society.<br/>

How about a spring boxing drive?  We could enjoy sloshing through <br/>
the New England mud season.<br/>
