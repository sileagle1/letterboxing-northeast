<br/>
When I was introduced to letterboxing  via the Girl Scouts this Fall.  I met some women who <br/>
had already doing letterboxing down in the Cape.  On the first page of their logbook there <br/>
was a stamp that said something about beginning her journey in letterboxing. Does anyone <br/>
know what this might have been?  I'm about to start my cousin letterboxing in NYC, and I'd <br/>
love to do that for her. <br/>
<br/>
If not - anyone have a good dedication for a new logbook?<br/>
<br/>
regards,<br/>

that you created or a combination of both. Special doesn't have to be <br/>
profound...it is simply expression from your heart. This is sure to <br/>
inspire your cousin to get out there and find letterboxes in NYC and <br/>
beyond. Always remember, as in life, all the bits and pieces that <br/>
make up letterboxing are journeys.<br/>
