if I had to leave early.  Picked up 4 boxes before the gathering and<br/>
was able to find the 9 boxes put out just for the gathering at<br/>
Bowdoin Park plus one permanent box there.  Everything was<br/>
wonderfully planned, the food was great and everyone I spoke with<br/>
seemed to be having a great time. We'll be back sometime to hunt for<br/>
more of those permanent boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Loved the stamps in the temporary boxes.  Thanks Phynstar for the Cat<br/>
Skills series and for whoever carved the Pooh series.  (Forgot to<br/>
note who did those.) Thanks to Talking Turtle and all the helpers for<br/>
a wonderful day.<br/>
<br/>
All in good shape:<br/>
