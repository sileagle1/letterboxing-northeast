It was fun to see all my letterboxing friends and meet new ones.  Hurd Park is a great place for hiking and this is the best time of year to get out there and enjoy the fresh air!  I didn't get all the boxes, but the ones I got were so much fun to find and I will definitely go back to get the rest before the year is done.  There was more than enough food, a nice toasty fire to remove the chill and smiling faces all around.  Thanks to all for a wonderful day!<br/>
<br/>
  Enjoy!<br/>
