Everyone has a favorite... Do you sneak in to the kitchen at 3AM and slather a bowl of vanilla ice cream with hot fudge and crushed Thin Mints?   Do you down a whole sleeve of Trefoils with a cup of tea?   Do you double dose on Double Dutch?<br/>
<br/>
Well let the world know... Cast your vote for your favorite Girl Scout Cookie today!<br/>

So, thank you to Talking Turtle and clan for an enjoyable snowy day of <br/>
LBing at the Great Cookie Caper Gathering. Bowdoin Park was lovely and <br/>
the kids (and several grown-up type kids &lt;grin&gt;) sure enjoyed that <br/>
fabulous sledding hill. It was nice to add a few F's a bunch of X's <br/>
while putting faces to names I had only seen online before. This was my <br/>
very first gathering, so everyone there was a new face to me!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my daughter and I had a great time, so thinks to everyone who <br/>
helped out and to everyone who showed up. I look forward to more <br/>
gatherings!<br/>
