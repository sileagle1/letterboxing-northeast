BTW, the image map for western mass is still off: although the dark <br/>

County. No big deal: it works correctly, just looks funny when you <br/>
click it.<br/>

<br/>
As we talked about last night a bit, I find it a bit confusing that when <br/>
you click on MA/CT/RI from the big map on the site, you end up at this page:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxStateRegion.php?state=mrc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxStateRegion.php?state=mrc</a><br/>
<br/>
Then, when you click on the state, you go to the state page. However, the <br/>
primary image on the page remains the same, it's just that the selected <br/>
state is highlighted in the darker shade of light green. But since it's <br/>
such a subtle change, I always hesitate and wonder why the new page didn't <br/>
load.<br/>
<br/>
I would be happy to split up the three states into separate maps if <br/>
everyone thinks that makes sense. Then once you click on MA/CT/RI from the <br/>
map, and then click on your chosen state, only that state will appear on <br/>
the map.<br/>
<br/>
For CT, my thought is to break it down into the eight counties, and skip <br/>
the 4 regions altogether. 1590 letterboxes spread over 9 pages (8 counties <br/>
+ mysteries) instead of 5 pages might make them a bit easier to navigate, <br/>
especially as the number of boxes in the state continues to grow.<br/>
<br/>
Any objections or better suggestions?<br/>

We sort of go to destination areas.  The Cape and the Islands are a logical grouping for where one would be operating out of for a base camp, radiating out from some campsite, hotel or other.  Besides, we're all used to the boundaries of county lines.<br/>

  I totally agree with Doug. Once you click the 3 state map for the state of choice, only that state should show. Then, I think the 8 county break down would prove most efficient for all. Good suggestion, Doug, for a transplant! :-) We're glad you finally came to your senses.<br/>

  And thanks, Choi, for your continued efforts to streamline and improve our beloved website, while keeping some of the original "old world" flavor. You've done a fine job.<br/>
