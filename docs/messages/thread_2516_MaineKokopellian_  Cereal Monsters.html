who found "Cereal Monsters" ... how many finds are you counting for<br/>
these?  They were all in one box, with one log book, so I'd say one,<br/>
but are now listed as seperate boxes on LbNA.<br/>
<br/>
There was a similar question back at the Mansfield Monster Mash with a<br/>
box called "The Great Pumpkin" ... only one logbook, but three boxes.<br/>
 In that case,  though, each box was in a different location, so the<br/>
determination was three finds.<br/>
<br/>
Just curious ...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

who raised the question, and others who are wondering.. Cereal <br/>
Monsters was created as a series for the Frightnight Gathering.  Due <br/>
to planting space ( at the picnic area) and time constraits, they <br/>
were not planted in separate boxes. The intent in their new location <br/>
is to have one logbook and separate box locations along a central <br/>
route. In much the same way some urban series have 1 logbook and <br/>
several microboxes,(One prime example is nearby in Portland), this <br/>
is the intention of the creator (myself) of this series.<br/>
<br/>
With the number of boxes hidden in the area around the gathering I <br/>
chose to put the stamps into one letterbox...<br/>
One can choose to log it accordingly. The series will be planted in <br/>
Maine and in separate boxes BUT 1 logbook.....<br/>
<br/>
I thank my esteemed colleague, CPAscott for posting this question to <br/>
the board. Anyone with other questions about the Frightnight boxes <br/>
please email me directly....<br/>
Your Humble Mainekokopellian<br/>
