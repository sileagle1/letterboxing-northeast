before leaving on vacation that the trail had been blocked off. The<br/>
orange netting that had blocked off the trail was open.  There is<br/>
construction going on but there was no equipment at the area near the<br/>
red trail where the box is.  There was an orange net blocking the<br/>
latter part of the trail, but I walked around it without any problem.<br/>
 I could hear construction equipment but it was in a different area<br/>
of the park.  You might want to wear long pants for this hike since<br/>
the trail is narrow and the vegitation is quite lush.  Watch for<br/>
healthy poison ivy when you step over a log.  <br/>
