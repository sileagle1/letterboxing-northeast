So all the stones in the stone walls are frozen together and you can't get at a letterbox without a crowbar (I tried, up in Vermont, to get at my own box!).  So take the hobby indoors!  There's already some there, thanks to the collusion of allies.<br/>
<br/>
We have new allies now!  In Jamestown, RI (small but mighty!) the nice library staff has allowed the New England Sigilography Series to kick off!  NESS #1 was just planted, and there are a few others about to follow.<br/>
<br/>
Stay tuned...<br/>
