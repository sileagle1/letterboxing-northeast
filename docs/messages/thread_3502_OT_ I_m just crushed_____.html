I'm very sorry to hear the bad news about Diesel.  My condolences to <br/>
you and the rest of your family on his loss. <br/>

I Loved You Best<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
So this is where we part, My Friend,<br/>
and you'll run on, around the bend,<br/>
gone from sight, but not from mind,<br/>
new pleasures there you'll surely find.<br/>
<br/>
I will go on, I'll find the strength,<br/>
life measures quality, not its length.<br/>
One long embrace before you leave,<br/>
share one last look, before I grieve.<br/>
<br/>
There are others, that much is true,<br/>
but they be they, and they aren't you.<br/>
And I, fair, impartial, or so I thought,<br/>
will remember well all you've taught.<br/>
<br/>
Your place I'll hold, you will be missed,<br/>
the fur I stroked, the nose I kissed.<br/>
And as you journey to your final rest,<br/>
take with you this...I loved you best.<br/>
<br/>
So sorry,<br/>

I am so sorry for your loss. I am also in CT and have seen your stamp <br/>
several times since we began letterboxing earlier this month. Our dogs <br/>
are a huge part of our family too. It is such a painful loss. I'm so <br/>
