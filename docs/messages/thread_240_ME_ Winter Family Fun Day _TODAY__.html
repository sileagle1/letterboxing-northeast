<br/>
It's short notice but today at the Wells Reserve at Laudholm Farm <br/>
from 12pm-4pm there will be a Family Fun Day event. If any of you <br/>
letterboxing fools-doh! -I mean, folks are in the area please come <br/>
down and find some of our event boxes. There will be crafts and <br/>
snowshoes to try out, hiking on the trails, and of course- a <br/>
letterboxing table set up by Nautilus &amp; Phyto!<br/>
<br/>
There will be 4 boxes on the property and clues are provided when you <br/>
register for the day. Please bring your friends and family but no <br/>
dogs unfortunately! The cost for the afternoon is $5 and it promises <br/>
to be a winter event after all.<br/>
<br/>
If you need more information please check out: <br/>

See you there!<br/>
Phyto <br/>
Note: boxes from this event might be planted afterwards :-)</div>
