<br/>
recently the owner of my favorite series "Witches Hollow" let his <br/>
website go offline and does not respond to emails. I would like to <br/>
adopt the boxes (which I know are in place) but I do not have the <br/>
clues. I just know where the boxes are. If anyone happens to keep clues <br/>
can you PLEASE scan a copy and email me or photocopy and snail mail me <br/>
them? If I dont get a responce I will just redo the clues but I would <br/>
much rather have the original clues. Thanks for the help.<br/>
