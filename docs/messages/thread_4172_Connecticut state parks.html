<br/>
Just wanted to give a heads up that my car was broken into at the Salmon River State Park in East Hampton/Colchester, CT yesterday.  When the troopers arrived they said there have been a rash of "break and takes" in the area and at a few other parks.  Be sure not to park in an isolated area and always bring your valuables (wallet) with you on your hike.    <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy~<br/>
