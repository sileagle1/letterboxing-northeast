help out "Leader of the Pack". She is having( and has had for some <br/>
time) foot problems that have not allowed her to check on her MANY <br/>
MANY boxes in the Mansfield area. I contacted her and we decided to <br/>
have a day devoted to repairing her boxes . This date is/was <br/>
November 5th or 6th. L of P is a VERY busy lady and we did not set a <br/>
date .<br/>
........................however some people have read my story on <br/>
mark's website about the MM day. Over 10 people wrote or called me <br/>
to say that they would like to help out in any way.<br/>
<br/>
Here's what has happened so far:<br/>
27 boxes have been checked  ( new outer bags, new inner bags, new <br/>
journals when needed , and new paper towels<br/>
<br/>
3 boxes have been discovered that were accidently deleted from the <br/>
main list ( look for these clues to reappear on tne main site in <br/>
October)<br/>
<br/>
2 boxes that were reported missing were found !!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
4 stamps have been recarved ( thank you Chuck and Music Woman)<br/>
<br/>
3 stamps are in the process of being recarved.<br/>
<br/>
2 sets of clues are rewritten with differnet clues ( look for <br/>
updates in Oct)<br/>
<br/>
WE still have over 30 boxes left to check. If anyone is planning on <br/>
coming over to Mansfield Connecticut in the next month and would <br/>
like to help out ............Please drop me a line .<br/>

Connecticut three times over the last month ... and have found a few<br/>
LotP boxes.  Sorry, I didn't know help was needed.<br/>
<br/>
Nice to see the response.  If it helps, since August 27 the following<br/>
LotP boxes were found in good shape:<br/>
<br/>
KJ's Best (Mansfield)<br/>
Mansfield Train Trestle (Mansfield)<br/>
Mansfield Depot Series - The Feed Store (Mansfield)<br/>
Mansfield Historical Society (Mansfield)<br/>
Bed Rug (Mansfield)<br/>
Inherit the Earth (Mansfield)<br/>
Got Milk? (Mansfield)<br/>
Donkey (Ashford)<br/>
<br/>
Special Snowflake (Ashford) was also found, but the logbook was very wet.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, I also have recorded "Reunion" by LotP in Harwich, MA, found<br/>
June 21 in fine shape.<br/>

"The Plane Spotter" (Mansfield) was attempted, but appears to be<br/>
missing.  That's also a LotP box.<br/>
