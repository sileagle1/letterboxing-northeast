posts were all polite and it sounds like he listened to the cautions <br/>
he received. From his response, it sounds to me like his parents do <br/>
the right things in terms of internet supervision.  Unlike a chat <br/>
room, posts generally remain on the list, so for his parents can <br/>
review them AND the responses he receives. If he was banned without <br/>
opportunity to give his side and comment, personally, I think that <br/>
was an error.<br/>
<br/>
As for misguided idea for meeting up with other boxers, I think Jay's <br/>
cautions about meeting up with strangers in the woods was good advice <br/>
and should be considered by adults as well. <br/>

Since when is it my job to "guide" anybody else's children? My 11 <br/>
year old son Ryan is also a member of the list but he doesn't post <br/>
because I've asked him not to. Who is running that household?<br/>
<br/>
 I was as worried that the whole thing could have been some kind of <br/>
undercover police sting operation and that they had just randomly <br/>
picked our group and let on they were 13 and would be waiting for <br/>
whomever showed up. I didn't want that connected to me in any way. We <br/>
even attempted to get Bluebird on the phone to confirm that she knew <br/>
him, and hers wasn't some name they picked from the members list to <br/>
make the whole thing more convincing.<br/>

where and when he would be alone in the woods.  Obviously this is a <br/>
topic that does go beyond letterboxing and is one in which there are <br/>
many different opinions.  My opinion is that the right thing was <br/>
done.  I would rather have Hikerlou banned for a few days than see <br/>
something bad in the news about another child hurt.  I understand <br/>
that his FEELINGS were hurt, but I this was done with no malice.  Now <br/>
that we know that Hikerlou is no longer going to go out in woods <br/>
alone to meet poeple, I think he should be allowed to join back in.  <br/>
I also hope that his parents DO post.  They should know what happened <br/>
and support the choices that were made regarding their son and his <br/>
activities on-line.<br/>

I for one completely support your decision to put a stop to Hikerlou's posts <br/>
until this matter could be sorted out in an appropriate manner. As a fellow <br/>
letterboxer I understand all of our desire to encourage a young letterboxer <br/>
and make him feel welcomed by visiting his box. HOWEVER, as a parent I would <br/>
be furious to think a group of adults allowed and encouraged my child to put <br/>
himself in an incredibly vulnerable and potentially dangerous position <br/>
witout intervening. If you think I am over emphasizing this watch the news <br/>
tonight and count how many children are kidnapped and murdered every day in <br/>
this country. Yes, it even happens to nice letterboxing families too.<br/>
<br/>
How many times after a tragedy do you hear people say if only I knew, if <br/>
only I paid more attention, if only if only.....the problem is you never <br/>
really know if you made the right choice or not. However, I think was a good <br/>
time to react first and ask questions later.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure Hikerlou will realize it was certainly done with his best interest <br/>
at heart and his parents should be grateful that Brian was only trying to <br/>
look out for their son.<br/>
<br/>
It was a tough decision and you will feel the flames lapping at your <br/>
backside but FROM A MOM, I'd rather have my sons feelings hurt than to have <br/>
something tragic happen.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there Brian, it's a tough job but someones got to do it and I for <br/>
one know you did right thing.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;when our children do things incorrectly we guide them in the right<br/>
&gt; &gt;direction. we never even tried in this case. how is the child going<br/>
&gt;to &gt;get educated if we the "adults" don't help them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Since when is it my job to "guide" anybody else's children? My 11<br/>
&gt;year old son Ryan is also a member of the list but he doesn't post<br/>
&gt;because I've asked him not to. Who is running that household?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I was as worried that the whole thing could have been some kind of<br/>
&gt;undercover police sting operation and that they had just randomly<br/>
&gt;picked our group and let on they were 13 and would be waiting for<br/>
&gt;whomever showed up. I didn't want that connected to me in any way. We<br/>
&gt;even attempted to get Bluebird on the phone to confirm that she knew<br/>
&gt;him, and hers wasn't some name they picked from the members list to<br/>
&gt;make the whole thing more convincing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;i knew he was going to come back under another name and he did. this<br/>
&gt; &gt;child has chosen a hobby that is kind and loving. why can't we be<br/>
&gt; &gt;that way to him?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also expected he would come back under a new name and I am glad to<br/>
&gt;see he did so openly. We emailed him and I also tried to get in touch<br/>
&gt;with him thru IM but he did not respond. I felt I had to do something<br/>
&gt;then and not later and did what I did because it was my only choice.<br/>
&gt;I knew no lasting harm would come of me stopping his messages till I<br/>
&gt;could sort things out.And looking back now after having time to think<br/>
&gt;things thru I admit I acted a little rashly. But at the time I didn't<br/>
&gt;have the luxury of being able to look back on things.I'd much rather<br/>
&gt;have come in today and received a nasty note from him than come in to<br/>
&gt;read of an abduction.I thought I was being "kind and loving" as best<br/>
&gt;I could considering the circumstances.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Hikerlou's posts were all polite and it sounds like he listened to<br/>
&gt; &gt;the cautions he received. From his response, it sounds to me like<br/>
&gt;his &gt;parents do the right things in terms of internet supervision.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I half expected to get an email from his parents or for them to post<br/>
&gt;themselves to let us all know things were on the "Up and Up". If they<br/>
&gt;were monitoring his posts then why didn't they step in when they read<br/>
&gt;our warnings about children on the internet? If I read Jay's post<br/>
&gt;written to my child about how he should set up his talklist to<br/>
&gt;protect himself, I would have absolutely got in touch with him.If not<br/>
&gt;for more advise, then at least to thank him for the guidance he would<br/>
&gt;have given my child. As for listening to the cautions he received, a<br/>
&gt;little late don't you think, he had already posted were he would be,<br/>
&gt;the cautions should have come from his parents before he was ever<br/>
&gt;allowed on the computer. Kim, are you telling me you would have no<br/>
&gt;problem having your 13 year old posting were they would be, alone and<br/>
&gt;in the woods?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;If he was banned without<br/>
&gt; &gt;opportunity to give his side and comment, personally, I think that<br/>
&gt; &gt;was an error.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Like I said I didn't have the "luxury of time" and made a snap<br/>
&gt;decision. Since no lasting harm would be done, I don't think this was<br/>
&gt;an error on my part. Doing nothing could have been an error that<br/>
&gt;would haunt me the rest of my life. To me this was something that<br/>
&gt;went way beyond letterboxing or this talklist.<br/>

You have echoed my feelings exactly! It's better to err on the side of caution when it comes to children and the crazies out there!<br/>
<br/>
We are debating the hurt feelings of a teenager - but better they were hurt than something unthinkable happening to HikerLou while innocently waiting out there waiting for a letterboxin exchange!<br/>
<br/>
Anyone with children knows that parents/adults are not always their best friends but have their best interests at heart.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

off quite a bit since I pushed the panic button and recommended that <br/>
hikerlou delete his yahoogroup and pushed Brian to ban him. <br/>
