<br/>
Sue &amp; I, Deanne &amp; Dave and Cheryl from Team Mad Dawg went searching <br/>
for this box in early May, before our first Dartmoor trip meeting. <br/>
When we couldn't find it, we verified that we were looking in the <br/>
correct location with Butterfly, who has been to that box many times <br/>
and practically lives at Rocky Neck. After checking, she did verify <br/>
that this letterbox is missing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

How great is that ?? Found in a different place ??  Sound familar to <br/>
anyone?? That sure is great news  The Red Dragon is  one of my favorite <br/>
stamps.  Lobsta and I found our frist H.H. there on Christmas eve many <br/>
 moons ago.  'Karen' is the placer I have written to her on several <br/>
occasions but no longer have her e mail address due to my famous crash ! <br/>
