my name is Katie and I just joined the group, but have been <br/>
letterboxing in New England for about a year. I just joined the main <br/>
group and got referred to this one because of a post I had made about <br/>
the Gateway to the Cape Cod CAnal Letterbox. I went looking for this <br/>
the other day with my daughter, and could not find it. I did search <br/>
under many cedar bushes, but part of the dunes is now a restricted <br/>
area because of the Piping plovers and other birds nesting there. My <br/>
question is, is the box still there, and in the restricted area, is <br/>
it lost, or am I just missing it altogether and it is right there? <br/>
Any help would be appreciated. Anyway, glad to join the group and get <br/>
some help. Nice to know of other boxers.<br/>
