<br/>
This weekend I found the following boxes:<br/>
<br/>
Checked on LLBLB<br/>
Checked on Maine Blues<br/>
Checked on Tropical Maine<br/>
Checked on Fort Frederick<br/>
Checked on Angel Gabriel<br/>
Found Snail Power<br/>
Found Whaleback Shell Midden (Not visited for 2 months)<br/>
Found the Porter Reserve series<br/>
Found the Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens series (this is a wonderful <br/>
place. I highly recommend it to everyone)<br/>
Found Two Faced Fox<br/>
Found The Art Guru<br/>
Found Home Sweet Home<br/>
Found Riverton Trolley Park<br/>
Found Maine Wolf Mystery<br/>
<br/>
I think that is all I found. If I missed any, I will post tomorrow. <br/>
All these boxes were in great shape. Some were not hidden as well as <br/>
they could have been, so I re-hid as best I could.<br/>

try for that one after all or did you have trouble with it? So far <br/>
only Wanda has found it (that we know of) so we're not sure how the <br/>
clues are to follow and would appreciate feedback. Hope all the <br/>
herbs you managed to pick up at Home Sweet Home are doing well :)<br/>
