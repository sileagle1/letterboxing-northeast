Okay, here's the situation. I'm going to be in RI this weekend for my<br/>
brother's wedding. I've got clues ready to go for the boxes in eastern<br/>
RI, but from AtlasQuest I've only got clues for just one series within<br/>
short distance of the Quidnessett Country Club in North Kingstown (the<br/>
series at Goddard SP).<br/>
<br/>
There's got to be more on LbNa than AQ for this immediate area, but...<br/>
<br/>
Any knowledge of others at Goddard?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

All Roads Lead to Rome Point. Although our clues are on Letterboxing.org, they are also listed on AQ and available by clicking on the cache icon on the right hand side.<br/>
I will be out of town next week, but good luck.<br/>
