might be able to help me out. I'm looking for someone to do a short <br/>
orienteering class and/or demonstration in the afternoon of <br/>
Saturday, September 25 as part of our National Estuaries Day <br/>
Celebration in Wells, Maine. The theme this year is "Where in the <br/>
World Are You?" because of the recent installation of two geodetic <br/>
markers onsite. I had someone tentatively booked from a Maine <br/>
orienteering club, but they have a national meet that weekend and <br/>
now they're not going to be able to do it because the club is short <br/>
a person there. I could probably do a small stipend (not to mention <br/>
putting you up in the oh so deluxe accomodations of the spare <br/>
bedroom of our house if you're not allergic to cats) but mainly you <br/>
would receive my undying gratitude in payment for your educational <br/>
services!<br/>

<br/>
Can't teach the class for ya - but you might try Lynne Richard over there and some <br/>
other folks - maybe Bridie from LEA in Bridgton - she might be helpful. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
