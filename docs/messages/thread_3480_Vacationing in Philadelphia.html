                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1490345956">So I finally have gotten around to planting most of the boxes I carved over a year ago.  The final series that I planted this week was carved last February, and I just couldn't get around to planting it.  I do still have one more box carved and ready to go, I just need to get around to planting it.<br/>
<br/>
All of these plants are in Manchester CT:<br/>
<br/>
I plotted out my "wrestling through the ages" series about 2 weeks ago and while out I checked on my Satellite Radio Wars series of boxes.  Both boxes were there and looking fine and I decided to leave them and retire them once these boxes were planted in the same park.  When I went to go plant I swung by where the XM box was and it went missing since then.  If anyone knows about it let me know, but my guess is it just went missing :(.  Here are the links to the Wrestling boxes, which are only available for a limited time:<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Last week I went out and planted the "Guarding the Hitchhiker Hostel" series:<br/>

<br/>
A couple of weeks ago I planted my Ship It series:<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
There is 15 boxes between those three series, so as the great Pepe once said "Get out there and box"<br/>
