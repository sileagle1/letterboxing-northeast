the barn (must have been left on the top floor), and we also have a <br/>
personal logbook and stamp, but each item belongs to a different <br/>
person.  The book is a child's, and very new, and the stamp is an <br/>
adult's, with a red ink pad.  These items were found during cleanup.<br/>
<br/>
Ink and hand-carved stamp: $3.95  <br/>
Sketchbook, hardly used, many blank pages:  $5.00<br/>
Blue cooler with bail-type handle, excellent condition: $10.00<br/>
Golden shoebox with historical documents: Priceless.<br/>

There are some things money can't buy.  <br/>

Write to me and we'll figure out how to get your stuff back to you. <br/>
Except Jay.  You need to contact Joan of Arc.<br/>
