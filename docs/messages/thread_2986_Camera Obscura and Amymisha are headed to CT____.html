been boxing there a handful of times? We are coming down on Saturday <br/>
and staying until Sunday. Anyone want to meet up for lunch or <br/>
something? I think we'll be in the Hartford/South of Hartford area. <br/>
Any recommendations? Feel free to email me off list, as I don't get on <br/>
the boards as much as I'd like! <a href="mailto:amymisha@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">amymisha@...</a><br/>
