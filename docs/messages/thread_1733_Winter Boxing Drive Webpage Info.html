<br/>
I've set up a webpage with the clues and the order of the boxes we<br/>
will be hunting next Sunday, January 16th. Bookmark it if you are<br/>
interested in coming as it will also contain cancellation info if the<br/>
weather turns bad. <br/>
<br/>
Watch Chrissy's posts regarding updates and cancellation and we'll<br/>
keep the same info on our website.<br/>
<br/>
Our Gatherings page with some info: <br/>

<br/>
Bring your own snack/sandwich, etc to eat during the day. We'll all<br/>
stop at a local pizza place for supper after the drive. Those of you<br/>
that have vans, we would appreciate you bringing them. We'll take up a<br/>
collection for gas to help defray some of the costs. Also, if you'd<br/>
like, bring a snack or hot drink to share. Sue &amp; I will have a few<br/>
thermoses of hot chocolate.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there,<br/>
<br/>
