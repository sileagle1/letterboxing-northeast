Saturday, June 11th from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.? We've already heard from more <br/>
than sixty attendees-to-be representing at least six states and one foreign <br/>
country (O, Canada!) and have plenty of room for more.<br/>
<br/>
New boxes have been sprouting up all over the place along with the <br/>
wildflowers and weeds around here, so there's more reason than ever to <br/>
visit even if you've been to Ithaca before. Word on the street (and in the <br/>
towers) is that one particular Tompkins County mystery box will be slightly <br/>
more available than usual on the day of the gathering, and it's one you <br/>
don't want to miss.<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested, many new details have been posted here:<br/>

<br/>
As always, we'd be happy to answer any questions about the gathering and <br/>
the Ithaca area, so feel free to ask.<br/>
<br/>
Hoping to see many of you next weekend,<br/>
