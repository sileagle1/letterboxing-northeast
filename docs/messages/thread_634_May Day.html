<br/>
I want to thank everyone who attended!  We couldn't have done it without all of you.  It was great to see some people we had met in Feb. and many new ones too!  Meeting such great people makes all the work well worth it!<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank The maplines and Teach &amp; Preach for thier help and the great boxes they planted.  Those two series will be out until Memorial Day only!  The April Showers Series is a permanent series.  Anyone who did not attend the gathering will be able to get those clues in the next couple of days!<br/>
<br/>
We did come home with an oval glass casserole dish and a serving spoon!  We may have a taker for the spoon!  If you lost your dish let us know, if we don't hear from anyone claiming it I guess it will turn into a Hitch Hiker to be left at the next gathering!<br/>
<br/>
Have a good night!<br/>

once again throwing a great gathering. We enjoyed the stamps, the<br/>

Thanks again, Anna &amp; Paul, for a great day.<br/>

I liked the scavenger hunt and the hikes to find the boxes.  It was a <br/>
wonderful idea to add to the fun.  I even spoke with one of the <br/>
parents who was leaving the picnic shelter before us, and they sounded <br/>
interested in our hobby.  Maybe a new addict?<br/>

So a great big thank you to the organizers of the May Day gathering <br/>
