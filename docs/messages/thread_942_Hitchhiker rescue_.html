mail today. Too bad the stamp itself was sabotaged, however - this might require a <br/>
recarve just for fun. I appreciate your great deed. It shall come with some reward!<br/>

gone - vanished - forever missing!! doh! it was a very small stamp, maybe somebody <br/>

too far from Quincy Market and Fanieul Hall.  It was opened in the <br/>
17th century and is supposedly the place where Boston patriots met to <br/>
plan the Boston Tea Party.  Apparently it's known in historical <br/>
circles as the "headquarters of the American Revolution".  Today it's <br/>
an Irish pub.<br/>
