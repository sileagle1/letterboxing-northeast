<br/>
I want to apologize for accidentally sending a message intended for a<br/>
different Yahoo group to this list. I realized my mistake immediately and<br/>
deleted the message from Yahoo, but when I got my digest today the message<br/>
was included.  Sorry!<br/>
<br/>
I had a great time finding the boxes along the Bray Loop at Mount Tom in<br/>
Holyoke today.  Hats off to the "L" Troop for another wonderful set of boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Also found the Dinosaur Footprints box and two of the five at Mountain Park<br/>
in Holyoke.  (The others are clearly missing.)  This place (an abandoned<br/>
amusement park) has an unsavory atmosphere, what with the broken glass,<br/>
rusted fences and other debris, and empty beer and liquor bottles all over<br/>
the place, so I am not surprised the boxes were missing.  If you hide a box<br/>
in a place where people obviously have no respect for nature, they are<br/>
probably not going to have any respect for your letterbox, either!<br/>
<br/>
On the carving frontI made a first attempt at my Gort/Day the Earth Stood<br/>
Still stamp for the Monster Mash but am not too happy with it.  Robots are<br/>
not so easy to carve!  Will try again, sigh.<br/>
<br/>
Again, sorry about the mis-sent post!<br/>
