Are both sites down?<br/>

Hopefully it's only temporary.  Just think of the mess we'd all be in <br/>
if it weren't???? I can't even begin to comprehend such a disaster! I'm <br/>
so happy I've spent so much time this winter printing out clues to use <br/>
on "better weather days" this spring, summer and fall.  Can you imagine <br/>
what would happen if we all had to remember all of our boxes and clues, <br/>
dates and all...and rewrite them? Might as well dig a hole and crawl <br/>
in...I don't think I could do it!  <br/>

you check the box for automatic login. If you do that on a <br/>
public computer, you need to make sure that you use the <br/>
Sign Out link when you're done so that it removes your <br/>
login information from that computer. I have a call into <br/>
our web hosting service to correct the problem.<br/>
