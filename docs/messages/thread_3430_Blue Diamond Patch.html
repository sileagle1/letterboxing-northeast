I am happy to debut a new patch..the Blue Diamond Worthy Letterboxer"<br/>
patch. There is no criteria or hoops to jump through to get this<br/>
patch. Even if you HAVE a BD, there is no guarantee you will have it<br/>
tomorrow, and so I made this patch to say LetterboxER...instead of<br/>
Letterbox. You may not have a BD at this time, but if you are a BD in<br/>
your heart and manner...by treating others with kindness and respect<br/>
and doing your best to be a positive contributor to the Letterboxing<br/>
hobby..you qualify in my book. I hope the patch will inspire you to<br/>
explore those cool places, write those awesome clues, and carve<br/>
beautiful stamps!<br/>
<br/>
Patches are $3 a piece and can be paid with Check, Money Order, Cash<br/>
or Paypal. Please enclose a self-addressed stamped envelope (1 stamp<br/>
for every two patches). The gray areas in the scan are actually done<br/>
in silver metallic thread...so cool! A couple of folks around the<br/>
country got a sneak peek at these..and I also debuted them at the<br/>
Mills at Salmon Falls event in NH. I really appreciated all the nice<br/>
compliments. Ryan and Amanda...yours are in the mail as we speak!<br/>
<br/>
Write to me on AQ or at <a href="mailto:Lockwench@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lockwench@...</a> and I will send you my<br/>
address. Tshirts may be in the works if I get enough interest.<br/>

That is the best way for me to describe it.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps having a Blue Diamond patch out there is reason for some people to<br/>
try to attain that status!<br/>
