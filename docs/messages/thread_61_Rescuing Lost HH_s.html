looking at Wanda and Pete's HH Tracking page and I say to <br/>
myself "self, there's a lot of hitchers out there that have not been <br/>
updated in a while".   Makes you wonder if they are "stranded", if <br/>
someone hasn't posted their travels in a while, or if they got lost <br/>
somewhere. <br/>
<br/>
Any solutions? Probably not. I think we'll be making a real effort to <br/>
visit some of the older and perhaps some of the....dare i <br/>
say.... "less popular" boxes in the area. I can't say "less popular" <br/>
meaning its a "bad" box, but what I mean is that there are many <br/>
series' and boxes out there that are just not as well travelled for <br/>
some reason.  Example:   I dropped off a HH at Jay's new one "White <br/>
Rock Quarry" in September. Being a fine carving and a new box, not to <br/>
mention I gave a huge hint, I expected someone to hop on it. Much to <br/>
my suprise, it was still there when I took B'Fly by that locale about <br/>
10 days ago.   <br/>
<br/>
Enough rambling, but I'd encourage everyone to take a few minutes to <br/>
revist boxes in your area once in a while so HH don't get stranded. <br/>
Also, post the travels once in a while. We've put 2 out and really <br/>
had no reports recently, and that becomes discouraging!  If you <br/>
placed a hitcher somewhere and its dropped off the face of the earth, <br/>
perhaps stop back, check, and move it along??<br/>
<br/>
Anxiously awaiting the comments...<br/>

<br/>
My very first box ever is a hitchiker called "Man's Best Friend" that <br/>
I released in April of 2002.  I carved the stamp with love and <br/>
released it in a special place.  It disappeared in the summer of 2002 <br/>
after being found by only two groups of people.  The last known <br/>
people to see the HH were Latte Man &amp; Curious Crane.  They dropped it <br/>
off at Trish Kurdziel's Midnight on the Moon LB in Narragansett, RI.  <br/>
Trish pulled a damaged log book from the box a while ago.  I asked <br/>
her if she could figure out who got my HH.  The log book was unclear <br/>
so it remains a mystery where my first letterbox went.  In a year and <br/>
a half it has never turned up :(  I don't expect I will ever hear <br/>
from it again.  This has made me very reluctant to releasing <br/>
hitchhikers.  I have posted several times asking if anyone has seen <br/>
this HH with no response.<br/>
