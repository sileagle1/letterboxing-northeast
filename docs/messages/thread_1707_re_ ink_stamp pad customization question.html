We still carry our stamps around and on a nice day we dont mind staying out a little longer to stamp in.  On the cold days it is a big time saver.  We even do some verticle and some horizontal depending on how the log book is.  A great place to get the stickers is the post office, you get priority mail ones for free there and just cut that part off.  You better hury if you want those though, they are changing it so that it says priority mail accross the whole thing, our post office just changed over this week, others weeks ago.  All depends on how quickly they use up the old ones.<br/>
