 <br/>
I learned from a fellow letterboxer today that my first box in this series has gone missing.  I went and checked it out and couldn't find it either.  I fully intend on recarving Healing Hands.  It will be planted in a different place close by and I will change the clues after I've replanted it.  A few of the other stamps may have revised clues as well.  I should be able to get this all done by next Wednesday - 7/16.  I'll post when I've completed it!  On a happy note, my letterboxing buddy, Kingston, found a letterbox that I wasn't aware of while hiking.  Woohoo!  Always a nice surprise.  He got a really BIG COOKIE for that one!<br/>
 <br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
