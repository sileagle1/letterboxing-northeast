yesterday!  After a long day on the trails in Eastford, I'm happy to<br/>
report we found all but one!  Combing the Eastford boxes with a the<br/>
Fairy Tales series in Chaplin, a couple in Mansfield, and one in<br/>
Ashford (Ashford Oak), I added 36 boxes to my F count yesterday -- a<br/>
single day record!<br/>
<br/>
We hit the trails at 8:30 in the morning, and didn't stop until we<br/>
needed the head lamp to get us out of the woods at 8:00 at night --<br/>
and then still stopped to pick up some drive by boxes before calling<br/>
it an official night around 11:00pm.  Wow!<br/>
<br/>
I won't have a chance to update my website until Thursday, but for<br/>
those of you with boxes in the area who'd like to see that they were<br/>
all in good shape, you can check out the list of finds on then!<br/>
