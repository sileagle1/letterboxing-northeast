Spring has sprung, and with it comes box maintenance.<br/>
<br/>
I designated this week as my MA letterbox maintenance week.<br/>
<br/>
It hasn't been a good week.<br/>
<br/>
So far, 8 of my active MA letterboxes are almost entirely destroyed.  <br/>
Could the common element be a particularly savage winter?  I so wish <br/>
that were the case.  The common element in the 8 destroyed letterboxes <br/>
was the last finders.  In all 8 cases, the last finders did not:<br/>
<br/>
1. Repack the logbook into its ziplock<br/>
2. Repack the stamp and inkpad into its ziplock<br/>
3. Put the lid back on the letterbox container<br/>
4. Rehide the letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Yes, folks, that's right.  I am now the proud parent of 8 active <br/>
letterboxes whose logbooks are soaked through from snow/rainfall, <br/>
obliterating all the signature stamps from all the previous happy <br/>
finders - but there's a bright side!  At least the now empty log pages <br/>
are brightly tinted the color of the inkpads since the last finders put<br/>
<br/>
the inkpads back into the letterbox without putting the *cover* back on<br/>
<br/>
the inkpads!<br/>
<br/>
At least the savvy last finders used pigment ink for their signature <br/>
stamps - these images are there clear as day.  And I should be grateful<br/>
<br/>
I suppose that when these last finders were done stamping in, they <br/>
helpfully left the unsealed letterboxes quite conveniently out in the <br/>
open, on *top* of the rock/log/cairn under which the boxes were <br/>
supposed to be hidden.  Of course, these nice clear images from the <br/>
last finder had only the notation of the date.  No trail name.  <br/>
Nothing.  I can't even contact these last finders to offer to give them<br/>
<br/>
well-intentioned (and I do mean that sincerely) instructions on not <br/>
only finding a box, but REHIDING a box.<br/>
<br/>
Grrrr.....<br/>
<br/>
I have repaired all of them with new logs and ink pads and ziplocks and<br/>
<br/>
have rehidden them properly.  So now all Warrior Woman boxes in MA <br/>
(with the exception noted below) are back in action, ready to go.<br/>
<br/>
And now it gets worse.<br/>
<br/>
Went out to the Ashland Reservoir today to do a spring checkup on my <br/>
Valentine Series.  All three are gone.  Well, sorta gone.  I did find <br/>
some forensic evidence of their previous existence.  In the general <br/>
vicinity of one box, I found the letterbox's rubbermaid container which<br/>
<br/>
had been conveniently turned into a portapotty by some enterpreneurial <br/>
partygoer.  Farther along the trail, I discovered that the logbooks had<br/>
<br/>
been used for kindling for a keg party fire.  All that was left was the<br/>
<br/>
wire binding and some charred bits of logbook still clinging to them.  <br/>
The last and final box, Thrill Me, I had replaced once already due to <br/>
vandalism.  Fortunately, I had replaced it as a film canister microbox <br/>
which miraculously escaped notice.<br/>
<br/>
After heaving a heavy sigh, I pocketed the "Thrill Me" microbox and <br/>
decided to turn it into a hitchhiker.  When I got home and unrolled the<br/>
<br/>
scroll log, I nearly screamed.  Guess who was the last finder of this <br/>
series?  Yep - that happy crew with the pigment ink who had left all my<br/>
<br/>
other boxes open and exposed.<br/>
<br/>
Rant over.<br/>
<br/>
I am officially retiring the Valentine Series in Ashland.  And I'd <br/>
advise anyone looking to plant around there to be very VERY careful <br/>
about where to hide the box.  Oh, but wait!  I guess it really doesn't <br/>
matter how well you hide the box if the last finder of your new box is <br/>
part of my happy little untraceable pigment ink crew.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry.  The rant is REALLY over now.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as I can find the heart to make another scroll log, I'll <br/>
release "Thrill Me" as a hitchhiker - after all, aren't you *thrilled* <br/>
when you find a hitchhiker in a box?!!<br/>
