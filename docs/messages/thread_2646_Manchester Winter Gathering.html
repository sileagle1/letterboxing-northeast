be a great time for an indoor gathering.  Unlike typical gatherings (where <br/>
everyone is rushing around trying to get the event boxes), there won't be a <br/>
specific series of boxes set out.  Instead, we'd like to be able to spend <br/>
more time on exchanges, have a carving demo and raffle, and enjoy the <br/>
potluck and company of the other boxers we often meet on the trails.<br/>
<br/>
In the spirit of this, we've reserved the conference room of the Super 8 <br/>
Motel in Manchester, CT for a meet-and-greet gathering.  Check their website <br/>
for directions.  Please bring a potluck dish (refreshments will be <br/>
provided), and carving materials if you'd like to attend the demo.  Of <br/>
course, don't forget your personal stamps and/or travelers!  Also, in order <br/>
to cover the cost of the room, we are asking for a small monetary donation <br/>
from the attendees.<br/>
<br/>
Please join us for an afternoon of food, fun, and friends- we'll be raffling <br/>
off some great prizes, and, though there isn't a set of event boxes, if you <br/>
are clever enough there will be a few secret boxes hidden at the event.  <br/>
There are also many existing boxes in the Manchester area.  RSVP is required <br/>
so we can give the hotel a head count, so please let us know if you'll be <br/>
attending via the atlasquest.com website or emailing <a href="mailto:tmalbernaz@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">tmalbernaz@...</a>.<br/>
<br/>
We look forward to seeing you there!  -Nature and Caipora<br/>
