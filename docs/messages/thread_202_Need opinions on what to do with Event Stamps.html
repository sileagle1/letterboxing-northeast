I'm not sure if I would do that again, but it seemed like the right<br/>
thing at the moment. In retrospect, I would have liked to have hung<br/>
onto that for myself.<br/>
<br/>
In your case, this sounds like a rather involved stamp. As a<br/>
suggestion, I would plant it as a special box perhaps. I like the idea<br/>
of turning an event carved stamp into a box afterwards for those that<br/>
didn't get to attent the gathering. In that case, others might enjoy<br/>
the special stamp afterwards.</div>

Somehow ?? Every Letterboxer in CT needs to have it in their log book. <br/>
 Somehow it would be great on a shirt, too.  How these things can be <br/>
done are up to the people with the know how.  Don't miss out on this <br/>
stamp. It has so much meaning that it need not be issued only for that <br/>
event. and the carving is one of the best around.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1602485932">I always assumed that event stamps, after their brief glow in the <br/>
sun, retired to a better place--wherever that might be.  The event <br/>
stamp was one way to encourage people to go to the event.  It was a <br/>
way to show that, "Yes, I made it to the Such-And-Such event."  Event <br/>
stamps were special for that reason.  They HAD to be hand-carved.  <br/>
(Unlike hiding a store-bought stamp--which I don't particularly like, <br/>
but I'll at least put up with--but ooooh....  if someone dares to <br/>
bring a store bought event stamp, they'll never hear the end of it <br/>
from me and I'd refuse to count it as an event stamp.)  So they had <br/>
to be hand-carved.  They had to be unique.  And they had to be <br/>
retired after the end of the event.<br/>
<br/>
And just because an event stamp is 'out of play' doesn't mean someone <br/>
not at the event won't be able to enjoy it.  They'll still be able to <br/>
see the stamped image in other people's logbooks.  That's what <br/>
logbooks are for, right?!  Why can't we admire a stamp without having <br/>
to claim it in our logbook?<br/>
<br/>
There's an event stamp I carved for an event in the Pacific <br/>
Northwest.  It's long since been retired; never used since the day of <br/>
the event.  But LOTS of people still see the stamp, because I turned <br/>
it into a clue for a box I hid at the event.  The stamp is a 'teasure <br/>
map' of the park where the event was hid, and X marks the spot where <br/>
the letterbox was hid.  I swore the event stamp would never be used <br/>
after the day of the event, but I scanned the image in, put it on my <br/>
website, and anyone that wants to hunt down the letterbox can print <br/>
out an image of the stamp (i.e. clue) to take with them.  If they <br/>
want to paste the imagine into their logbook, that's fine with me.  <br/>
But as long as it's not a stamped image, only the few that made the <br/>
effort to go to the event can have an original impression.<br/>
<br/>
If one were to hide an event stamp after the event, at least hiding <br/>
it in the park where the event occurred might mollify me somewhat, <br/>
but it still seems out of the letterboxing spirit.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, just my two cents.  For those that think retiring a stamp is <br/>
a shame because then nobody else can "enjoy" it, I'd just like to <br/>
remind them that that's simply not true.  Logbooks will keep the <br/>
stamp in circulation for years and decades to come.<br/>
