We, of course, got on the subject of letterboxing, which they had never heard of before! They were so excited, they got on the computer right then and looked up clues and found a box within walking distance from their house! She pulled out her box of rubber stamps and everyone chose one (can you believe WE didn't have out stamps with us?????). Then we packed up the kiddos and took off for a late afternoon walk to find Countryside Park by Bell Lady! Thanks its a great carving! Our friends are HOOKED! Already planning trail names and carvings! They were SO excited!<br/>
<br/>
The box cover has a crack in it, probably from the large rock on top of it and the ink pad could use replacing soon and there was no pen, so we couldn't sign/date out page. But our friend plans to go back soon, since she is nearby. Otherwise it was  a great find! Thanks Bell Lady!<br/>
