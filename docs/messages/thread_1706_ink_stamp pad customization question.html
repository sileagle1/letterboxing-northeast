away, it has jelly beans on it, with my name, jbean. Now, jelly <br/>
beans are all different colors and so I use markers to color in each <br/>
small bean then give it a huff before stamping in. It makes a great <br/>
image, but is quite time consuming, especially when, like today, I <br/>
did a series of 5 boxes. And even more so now that I am trying todod <br/>
all this in the snow with a heavy coat, thick gloves and a 6 year <br/>
old to track also!<br/>
<br/>
So, I tried to consider a multi-colored stamp, but it just doesn't <br/>
look the same. My husband and I just spent an half hour in AC Moore <br/>
trying to figure out how to customize a blank pad to incorporate the <br/>
colors where I need them. I'm pretty sure I can pull it off with a <br/>
little effort, but since my computer crash, I lost all my Favorites <br/>
and have had to rebuild the list. I know there was a company on line <br/>
that had all sorts of ink supplies and stuff, any suggestions?<br/>
