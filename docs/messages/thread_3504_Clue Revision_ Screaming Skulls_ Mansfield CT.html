                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1296355409">The clues to my series  "In Search of Screaming Skulls" in Tolland County, Mansfield CT have been revised. Box #1 The Screaming Skull of Burton Agnes Hall has been moved. The box was in a hole in a tree. I sadly found out that the tree actually fills up with water and holds it there for quite some time. The updated clues are now online. ....Chuck<br/>
