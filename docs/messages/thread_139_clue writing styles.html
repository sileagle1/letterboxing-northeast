writing. I don't often add a time or distance element to my clues, hoping to make <br/>
them a bit more cryptic. However, if I consider some or all of a hike not suitable for <br/>
some because of difficulty or possible danger, I ALWAYS say so in my clue.<br/>
<br/>
The element of the unknown is one of the things I like most about this hobby. I don't <br/>
want to see the stamp before I open the box. If the clue writer makes me look <br/>
carefully at the surroundings as I pass by, I love it but I don't want to be told about <br/>
them in advance. If I have to Google parts of a clue, I'm in Hog Heaven. If I have no <br/>
idea how long a hike is, c'est la vie. If I have no idea how long a hunt might take I <br/>
would probably not try for it on a day that had time constraints. I actually wish there <br/>
were more Dartmoor style clues to be found on this side of the pond. These tend to <br/>
be nothing more than a set of map coordinates and compass headings to landmarks. <br/>
How you get there is up to you. <br/>
<br/>
I have taken a number of kids on letterboxing hikes and I would usually choose a hike <br/>
with known perameters if I were going with them. In that case, a clue indicating <br/>
length and difficulty would be useful but I'm not in the least bit averse to doing the <br/>
research myself to learn about a trail. For me, that's part of the fun.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, there are so many different types of people involved in this hobby that <br/>
there are a myriad of clue writing styles out there. The possibility of creating a <br/>
uniform style is nil. The Mapsurfers of our world will continue to create clues that <br/>
take months to decipher. The Green Turtle will take us up impossibly steep gradients.  <br/>
Kindergartners will take us to the swing set in the local park. There's something for <br/>
everybody. Hooray!</div>

Out where I live, there is such a thing called hunting season.  <br/>
Whenever I place a box in an area where I know that hunting is <br/>
permitted from Nov 1 to Feb 1, I *always* start my clues with "the <br/>
fashion statement for today is blaze orange".  In fact, I wear blaze <br/>
orange year round because there always one out there ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I have learned from experience, however, to find a box before taking <br/>
my children on an unknown trek.  This is kind of fun - I get to box <br/>
it myself, then I have the joy of watching them figure out the clues <br/>
and finding the box (or giving random nudges when they are off <br/>
course).<br/>
<br/>
If I go with an adult letterboxing partner, then all bets are off!  <br/>
Wheeeeeee!<br/>

Flat, level ground.  Unless you count curbs.  Sheeze, give someone a <br/>
strenuous hike and they never forget.  Give them an easy one and <br/>
they always forget.  *rolling eyes*  =)<br/>
