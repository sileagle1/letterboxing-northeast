box, the stamp being broken in two.  It's now repaired and mounted on <br/>
wood for security and back in it's home where it belongs.  Thanks also <br/>
to The End who dried out several boxes that were left either loosely <br/>
covered or not "zipped" up lately.  The End is a good example of a <br/>
great letterboxer. Thanks again!</div>
