survivor, Lisa of The Family From Mass.<br/>
<br/>
I am hosting a fundraiser for the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer on April <br/>
5th.  To get more people to come, we have made this into a letterboxing <br/>
event.  There will be event stamps there, and any other boxer who <br/>
wishes to bring a box or PT is welcome.  <br/>
<br/>
We hope many will come, and bring friends.  The event is listed on the <br/>
Atlas Quest calendar page, as well as on the LBNA site.<br/>
<a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=694" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=694</a><br/>
<br/>
For $25 you a buffet dinner, dancing to TruSound DJ Services, and much <br/>
more... and don't forget those finds you can only get at this event.<br/>
<br/>
Please, come one, come all, and have fun, meet people, and raise funds <br/>
and awareness!<br/>
