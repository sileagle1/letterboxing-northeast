It was obvious that a lot of work and planning went into this event and for those who braved the dire weather prediction it was a fabulous time. We all learned something about Greek mythology as we traversed the hiking trails at the park and found the beautiful stamps. It was great to have the day devoted to the quest and the evening meal as the time for questers to exchange and visit. The bonfire was the perfect ending to the day, or so we thought, until we were invited to find the 12 labors of Hercules in a night boxing challenge. <br/>
Thanks to our intrepid boxing buddies for the day, Phynstarr, Nautilus and Culex and Automan. We had a blast hanging out with you guys.<br/>
SapphireBerry, we wish we had a laurel wreath to crown you with for your success, thanks again!!<br/>
