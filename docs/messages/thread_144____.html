Sue and I were sure glad we went! This was our first gather and we got to meet alot of the New England letterboxers - some who became real close friends, like TeamGreenDragon and Wanda &amp; Pete. And we really upped our "F" count!<br/>

<br/>
I may be hearty(aka 'Kim of the Antarctic'), but I gotta draw the line <br/>
somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
I always describe our New England weather to non-New Englanders in this way:<br/>
<br/>
90 + degrees (with its usual 90% humidity) = Freakin' hot (substitute your <br/>
favorite F word here)<br/>
80 - 90 degrees = very warm<br/>
70 - 80 degrees = nice and warm<br/>
60 - 70 degrees = Niiiiiiiiice!<br/>
50 - 60 degrees = Perfect T-shirt/sweatshirt and jeans weather - pretty much <br/>
ideal for a good hike<br/>
40 - 50 degrees = cool<br/>
30 - 40 degrees = brisk<br/>
20 - 30 degrees = chilly<br/>
10 - 20 degrees = cold<br/>
under 10 degrees = Freakin' cold (again...your favorite F word here) or as we <br/>
New Englanders like to say:" Bittah cold"<br/>
<br/>
That about captures it... :-)<br/>

<br/>
The high for Sharon, MA, on January 18, 2003, the date of the Moose<br/>
Hill gathering, was 21 degrees, with an approximate wind chill of 13<br/>
degrees.  The high predicted for Sharon tomorrow is 11 degrees, with a<br/>
wind chill of -2.  That's just if you go out during the warmest part<br/>
of the day.  If you begin 'boxing at 9am you'll be facing a temp of 3<br/>
degrees with a windchill of -11.<br/>
<br/>
Call me wimpy, but as much as I feel a great need to go letterboxing,<br/>
I have no desire to be a letterboxicle.  I'll be indoors, soaking up<br/>
all the warmth I can get.  I suggest the rest of you do the same. <br/>
You'll need all of your fingers for the stamping frenzy on February<br/>
29, after all.<br/>
<br/>
Stay warm!<br/>

</span></blockquote>We're very much interested in going to Dartmoor, but we have a couple<br/>
of issues.  The main one is that Kim recently started a new job and<br/>
she may not have enough vacation days accrued to make it worth our<br/>
while to go this year.  The other issue is tied in; neither of us have<br/>
ever been to England before and we want to take at least three weeks<br/>
to visit all over.  So traveling with a group might not be the best<br/>
option.<br/>
<br/>
However, I'm open to possibilities.  Send me info on when you plan to<br/>
be there.  If all else works out, maybe we can meet up.<br/>

As much as we'd love to, I'm not sure we'd be able to get our respective acts <br/>
together in any reasonable amount of time. We have talked about going to <br/>
England since we heard of the anniversary of Dartmoor, but neither of us think <br/>
we'd get time from work or be planned enough until the fall or next spring. <br/>
Neither of us have been there, so we'd want to plan all the places we'd want to <br/>
go.... We really would want to go for an extended period - like 3 weeks, so that <br/>
we could really see the sights, not just Dartmoor, but all over.<br/>
<br/>
I'd really want to see all the traditional Pagan sites and London, of course, <br/>
and some of the castles.<br/>
<br/>
Now, you've gone and got me all dreamy eyed. sigh! <br/>
<br/>
If/when you go, a friend of mine who is from England said that one of the <br/>
nicest and least expensive ways to go is to stay in B&amp;Bs. She said it's not like <br/>
it is here, where a B&amp; B can cost more than a hotel room...over there, it's <br/>
thought of as a frugal way to travel.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>

The funny thing is, we were going to have his friends over to help when we <br/>
strip the wallpaper and paint the rest of the apartment, so a gathering wouldn't <br/>
be too far off.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm...we could hide LB's in all the nooks and crannies of his three room <br/>
apartment and have a mystery box in the basement.<br/>

it comes time to strip all the wallpaper from the bedroom, livingroom,<br/>

That was a very BRISK 30minute jaunt.<br/>
By the time I reached the car afterwards, I could not feel my chin or<br/>
lower appendages...<br/>
<br/>
While on the way through SouthWestern New Hampshire today en route to<br/>
Keene, we thought it would be interesting to try the Otterbrook Dam<br/>
box. As we slowly ascended the (un-sanded) sheet of ice (aka road) we<br/>
started to feel the car slipping. Sure enough... that box was NOT<br/>
happening. Thank goodness a sanding truck arrived shortly thereafter.<br/>
Small favors.<br/>

It's 6:00 am and -3 here in northern RI. I'm going to head out to my wood shop, light a fire in the woodstove,  and finish my new Letterboxing Journal. But wait till 8:00 pm, I'll be out on my porch barbequing a roast for the big game.  Go Pat's!<br/>

</span></blockquote>Well, Christopher, you know how hot blooded I am.  So far, I have <br/>
managed this winter without a coat.  Until two days ago.  I caved the <br/>
day I woke up and it was minus 7 on the outside thermometer.<br/>
<br/>
I have used my time wisely, however!  I have assembled two 3-box <br/>
series to be planted near the Winter Gathering location to increase <br/>
the box count in the area.<br/>
<br/>
So - technically, I have been engaged in letterbox activities ;-)<br/>
