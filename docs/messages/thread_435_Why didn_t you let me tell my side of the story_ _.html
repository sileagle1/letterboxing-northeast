And yes - it did seem like we all were talking about just some kid, but it's the same level of protectiveness we show each other, too.  Welcome to a tight crowd,  bud!  We look after each other mighty close, and Lordy save the creep that tries to mess with any one of my pals!  But meeting anyone alone is just a *bad* idea.  We've just had two extremely bloody, horrible murders in Rhode Island/Connecticut in the last week alone.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if it came off too harsh.  Quick reactions seem usually 'way too harsh when read in writing.  It's the thought that counts?<br/>

  make me show them the internets history.#2 Jay told me not to go to <br/>
  my box and i didn't.#3 You didn't even warn me that i was going to <br/>
