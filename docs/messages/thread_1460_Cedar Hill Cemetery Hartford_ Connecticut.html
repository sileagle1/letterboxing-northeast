couldn't find the first box, I suspect it is missing but we found the other 3,  <br/>
all are in desperate need of new log books... I will try to get out there in the <br/>
 next couple weeks as I would love to explore the cemetery more without the  <br/>
thought of the "hunt" on my mind. The Horace Wells Stamp was being guarded  by <br/>
2 female deer that we were able to get quite close on and sat there looking  <br/>
at each other for a good 10 minutes :o) The J P Morgan Stamp was guarded by a  <br/>
lunching Red Tailed Hawk and on the way out we saw a large egret of some kind <br/>
as  well as mallard ducks and a few Canada Geese.... We also so a bunny and <br/>
many  different kinds of birds, I do believe I saw my first juncos of the year <br/>
and I  also ran into a few Carolina wrens while digging out the Crying Woman <br/>
Letterbox  (I plan on going back to find the stone that the stamp is based on) <br/>
as well  as my favorites the chickadees. I know for myself those are the <br/>
things I'd like  to see on a trip. Thank you to the placer and thank you for <br/>
inviting me to such  a wonderful place to visit. Off to Mile of Ledges tomorrow. <br/>
Only a few weeks and  about 15 stamps into this and I am hooked, DH laughed when <br/>
I said I was going to  try this through the winter, I hate the cold but I <br/>
think my love of this will  actually outweigh my hatred of cold lol.<br/>
