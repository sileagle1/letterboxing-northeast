<br/>
I enjoyed "Pizza pie" by CBP the other night while sitting amongst the bustling <br/>
portland waterfront. Thanks! Took a hike through the woods in Saco today to find <br/>
Giddy's new "Caged Bear" and other boxes. Really enjoyed the history of that spot.<br/>
<br/>
Checked on "Bird Walk" today - no visitors since Giddy in March. I guess my clues <br/>
are harder to find now. Did some trail maintenance in that spot. Breathed in some <br/>
ocean air, the beach roses are ALL IN FULL BLOOM and all over the <br/>
place....gorgeous. Built a cairn and paused a moment to remember a family <br/>
member that passed away this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there's some new brochures near the entrance to the Wood Island/East Point <br/>
Audubon Sanctuary. Apparently there is now an organization dedicated to <br/>
preserving the Wood Island Lighthouse. Good stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Some other boxes that are still in place...<br/>
Deering Oaks Rose Circle<br/>
Spring Point<br/>
Higher Education -no recent visitors :-(<br/>
Francis Fasset House - beautiful historic spot - Thanks Merenwen.<br/>
<br/>
It was wonderful to be back in Maine and see all the great boxes and visit some <br/>
familiar spots through the creative eyes of you folks. I really enjoy the new boxes in <br/>
Portland and beyond. <br/>
<br/>
love love love<br/>
