I did not realize that I had been using `stone age' carving tools until <br/>
I got a Speedball set (Yikes!Â…I don't know what took me sooo long!!).  <br/>
Thanks to the hints given by Scarab for carving techniques and the <br/>
encouragement of Dragonfly, I am trying a `new' approach to my stamps.  <br/>
Please have patience; hopefully it is a `work in progress'! My first <br/>
project was to replace my only `store-bought' plant, Indian Grounds, <br/>
which is now has a hand carved stamp.  It won't count as a find for <br/>
those who found it already (thanks for looking!), but I thought <br/>
a `heads-up' was in order in case they would like get the new image, or <br/>
come across this new image in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting<br/>
