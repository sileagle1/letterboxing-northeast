gathering it was!  It was so nice to meet so many new boxers!  I haven't even <br/>
counted up the exchanges yet, but they were plentiful!  Thanks to so many who <br/>
stamped into my Manchester United letterbox!  Your stamps will be heading to <br/>
Dartmoor in August and the British boxers will get to see the stamps from some of <br/>
our boxers here in the states.  Thanks to Rustypuff and CSCM for putting <br/>
together a great event and thanks to Moose Hill for allowing us to have the event <br/>
there!<br/>
<br/>
After the gather, we were successful in finding a couple of Camera Obscura <br/>
boxes and some other mystery boxes as well!  Thanks to Donny who was able to <br/>
fish the red dude ;-) out of his hiding place.  Kellie and I looked in the hole, <br/>
but didn't see anything, but somehow Donny was able to sense that it was <br/>
there!  It was also nice to see the BIG Virgin back in place after it's unfortunate <br/>
demise.  CO, you did a GREAT job on the cutting, pasting and scanning the old <br/>
ripped up logbook!  The stamps were also GREAT!  Wow..... bring a BIG logbook!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for a great day!  Now I have to stay up all night to finish my <br/>
grad class homework... which I got in the mail BEFORE THE CLASS EVEN <br/>
STARTED!!!!!  UGH!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>

exchanged stamps and good conversation, as well as<br/>
enjoying a potluck lunch.  Those of us who boxed<br/>
weren't hampered by much more than a few sprinkles. <br/>
Thanks again, Peppermint Patti, for some awesome new<br/>
boxes in Sharon.  I highly recommend the TV Land<br/>
series, Disc Golf, and of course, Summertime at<br/>
Crescent Ridge Dairy!  And thanks, Rustypuff, for all<br/>
your work in putting together such a successful<br/>
gathering.<br/>

It was very nice to meet a few people I haven't met before (Songbird<br/>

seen since October.<br/>
