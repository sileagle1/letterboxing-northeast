                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-155275354">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Binx and I spent a wonderfully sunny day boxing in Bolton, MA...half <br/>
of which with Amymisha and Camera Obscura (hi guys!). We've decided <br/>
that Bolton must have more stone walls than just about any town in <br/>
New England we've yet been to! <br/>
<br/>
Most of the boxes in this town were originally planted in 2000 and <br/>
the clues posted only in the town newspaper. More recently, the <br/>
boxes have been adopted by active letterboxers (thanks Seekyr, <br/>
Blaze, &amp; Mobius!) and published to the LBNA site. Many of the clues <br/>
require some light puzzle-solving and/or knowledge of the town's <br/>
many wonderful conservation areas, so plan for some pre-boxing <br/>
research. Though we haven't yet solved all the clues, we've been <br/>
enjoying getting to know the wild parts of this pretty town.<br/>
<br/>
These boxes are severely under-visited and need the love and ink of <br/>
more letterboxers. Go and check em out!<br/>

all enjoying the Bolton series.  Thanks so much for your help in <br/>
getting the Bolton Bull's Eye water tight again.<br/>

For those of you who would like to learn more about the Bolton Series <br/>

If you are unfamiliar with Bolton and its conservation areas take a <br/>
look at this map for an overview of the area and links to the Bolton <br/>
Trail Guide descriptions of the areas.<br/>

<br/>
Nearby Harvard and Acton also have a few boxes, and Westborough and <br/>
Leominster (both of which have excellent letterbox series) are each <br/>
within a quick half hour drive from here as well.  So there's plenty <br/>
of Boxing action to be had in the area.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy and keep visiting!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
