not missing at all. They are, in fact, in great shape and just where they <br/>

its location, it will not be replaced.<br/>

If you choose to take on this Challenge, please remember to conserve space <br/>
in the very small logbooks by using only a portion of your signature stamp <br/>
if it's a large one. Future finders will thank you for leaving a little <br/>
room for them.<br/>
