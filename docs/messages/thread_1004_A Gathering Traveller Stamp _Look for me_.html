Thoughts of mountains that you've climbed<br/>
While your at a gathering time<br/>
<br/>
Look for this box when you rest<br/>
In the grass may be best<br/>
<br/>
Now move the box away from here <br/>
To a spot you'll have to define where<br/>
<br/>
Write it down then pass the clues to another<br/>
Maybe a sister, brother, father, or mother<br/>
<br/>
In the end I'll be the last<br/>
I hope to find it somewhat fast<br/>
<br/>
With lots of stamps and fun clues<br/>
Provided by all of you!</div>

letterbox which will provide paper to write clues. This is like a <br/>
telephone box allowing people to move the box and then share the new <br/>
clues; each person in turn having to start from the beginning and <br/>
then going longer as it is passed from boxer to boxer. I plan on <br/>
being last. (In addition it gives people more practice in hiding and <br/>
finding!!)<br/>
