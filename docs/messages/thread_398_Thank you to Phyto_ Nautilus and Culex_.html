a blast. The boxes for both the gathering only and the permanent <br/>
boxes were fantastic! <br/>
<br/>
I loved Deb's presentation about Dartmoor...it was just great. The <br/>
presentations were neat... I wish I had done Nautilus' matchbook <br/>
log book demo. I flaked out at presentation time though. D'oh! <br/>
The tick info was super informative too... I actually need to go <br/>
check right now. Urgh. And of course, Phyto's felt pouch demo <br/>
rocks!<br/>
<br/>
It was a super good time, and full of gossip, socializing, and fun. <br/>
My sister came too, which was a big treat! And I got a <br/>
champagne toast by Camera Obscura for my F100 yesterday. <br/>
<br/>
So, thank you for a wonderful day. <br/>
