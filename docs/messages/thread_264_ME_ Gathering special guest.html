<br/>
Those that are planning to come to the Maine gathering in March are in<br/>
for a special treat. I just confirmed that we will be having a special<br/>
guest for the event.  Deb Blanchard is an educator from Maine who has<br/>
developed the Lakes Region Letterboxing Trail in Raymond. <br/>
<br/>
Deb has also been letterboxing for 10 years and has made several trips<br/>
to Dartmoor. She will be sharing her slide show of photos from her<br/>
Dartmoor trip for those at the gathering. Deb will also be bringing<br/>
stamps and other memorabilia as well! It might be especially handy to<br/>
speak with her in preparation for those who are planning to travel to<br/>
Dartmoor this year with Mark or perhaps in the future.<br/>
<br/>
I'm very happy that Deb will be there and I hope this will encourage<br/>
those of you who weren't sure if you should make the drive to come!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you on March 21st. Nautilus and I will be posting more<br/>
information about this gathering in March after the excitement of the<br/>
upcoming POE gathering subsides!<br/>
