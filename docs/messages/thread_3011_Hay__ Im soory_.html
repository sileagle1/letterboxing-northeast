I think more i was fustrated that i could not go further to look for<br/>
the stamps. He makes such good stamos.<br/>
 I hike alone all the time, but where i live i feel safe.<br/>
I dont have anyone--im alone and so if didnt go alone-i never go<br/>
anywhere. Its hard being alone and it really helps a lot here, because<br/>
people answer you. And people were so great when i went to agathering<br/>
in Maine. All of you are wonderful and nice people.<br/>
Would love to meet more people who would go boxing or hiking with me-<br/>
But for now thanks for all of you being here and supportive</div>
