                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1334542054">We recently had an opportunity to check on our "seafaring mystery" <br/>
microboxes, and were amazed to find that even after a whole year they had <br/>
still not been stamped into!  "The Quarry" had, in fact, gone missing, probably <br/>
due to a party of teenagers in the area, some evidence of which we saw, so <br/>
we recarved and replaced that box in a safer nearby location.  Also, the <br/>
"Plymouth Rock" box had dropped into a perilous predicament, so Pete <br/>
carefully extracted that one and replaced it in a safer spot as well.  Updated <br/>
clues for both of these (the third one stays the same) are on our web site.  So <br/>
now, for all you New Englander boxers who claim to love mysteries, all we <br/>
can say is "don't miss the boat"!  It's really not a very hard mystery compared <br/>
to some that are out there, so come on, folks, put on your captain's hats and <br/>
come steer the ship!<br/>
