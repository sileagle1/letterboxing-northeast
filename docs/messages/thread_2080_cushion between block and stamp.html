Can anyone tell me the name of the cushion medium that goes between the block and the rubber stamp and where I can order it?  Someone gave me a piece of it and it's much easier than gluing the stamp on the block.  All you have to do is remove the paper on each side of the medium to reveal the sticky surface.  Just press block and stamp on each side and you're good to go.  Thank for your help!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

Mounting Foam" used with unmounted rubber stamps.  I don't know how <br/>
it holds up under winter conditions, but I just used it to mount a <br/>
stamp not intended for outside conditions and it worked like a charm. <br/>
Here's an online link for an 8.5" x 13" sheet @ $4.39, they also sell <br/>
ink pads and reinkers and offer good service.  You might be able to <br/>
find it locally as well.<br/>
