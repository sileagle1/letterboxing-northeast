NO, I didn't cancel because of the April Drive.  I realize that people can't always make a Sunday Gathering and some people don't care for the drives so this probably wouldn't affect the Gathering.<br/>
<br/>
NO, there is nothing wrong with anyone in my family, everyone is fine and healthy.<br/>
<br/>
Help with the event is not even an issue, I have had many, many offers of help from several people.  Thank You to all who offered!!<br/>
<br/>
My husband feels that we are overly busy and that now that I work full time I might not have the time to organize this, I don't agree!  I would never plan something without the time to do so.  He also does not have as great an interest in Letterboxing as I do (please don't tell him I told you !)  <br/>
<br/>
I do have some people helping me and I will rethink my decision to hold the gathering.  I was looking forward to seeing many of you again and meeting new people just like all of you were.  <br/>
<br/>
The plans I had so far really made for an easy time of it gathering wise (does this make sense!)  I don't want to say too much and give it away just in case we decide to hold it.  There will be a bit of mystery involved.  I know some of you were concerned where is was being held (part of the mystery) I can tell you it will be in the general area of last year.<br/>
<br/>
I will decide what to do in the next few days and get back to everyone next week after my weekend trip to Washington DC to see my grandson.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, PLEASE be nice or I might have to cancel for good if I hear you were all mean to each other!!<br/>

<br/>
I'm sure I can speak for many that we'd be very happy if you could <br/>
still hold the May Day Gathering, yet I do understand that if Bald <br/>
Eagle doesn't feel that you should be putting all this time into it, <br/>
then it probably doesn't sit right with you to do it...soooo...we <br/>
must convince him otherwise!!!! ;-)  Since you're a non-'boxer, Bald <br/>
Eagle, perhaps if I volunteer my non-'boxing husband to maybe work <br/>
with you on the grill??? Guys like to do that don't they???  This <br/>
way you can still be part of the fun without 'boxing...<br/>
And Momma Fox, I'm sure after your post, you'll be flooded with even <br/>
more offers of help - myself included as I mentioned to you <br/>
yesterday...<br/>
<br/>
So thank you for thinking about reconsidering, Momma Fox, but your <br/>
decision ultimately has to be the right one for YOU!<br/>
