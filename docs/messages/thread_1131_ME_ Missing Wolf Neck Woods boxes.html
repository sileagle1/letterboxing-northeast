I was wondering if anyone knew if Bulldog and The Ram were around <br/>
here. I went to find their Wolf Neck Woods Letterboxes today and <br/>
they were missing. Aparently they have been missing for a while. I <br/>
was hoping to get in contact with them to either let them know, or <br/>
ask if I could replace the boxes and adopt them for them. Anyone <br/>
have any ideas what I should do? The clues are really great and the <br/>
spots were wonderful, too. I feel there should be boxes there.<br/>
