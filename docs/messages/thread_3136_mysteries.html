i've been printing out many mysteries to solve and find.  some <br/>
people enjoy challenges and we are some of those people.  it all <br/>
depends on what you're looking for.  as newbies we wanted to get the <br/>

for those of you who have time to do mystery boxes GOOD FOR YOU!!! I <br/>
wish I had the time to figure them out. I'm sure there are a lot of <br/>
boxers out there like me, when they started boxing they had plenty <br/>
of time to go for a hike or a long walk or solve a mystery, but then <br/>
sometimes life takes over. When I started boxing I had a 40hr a week <br/>
job...lol...those were the days. Now I work over 60hrs a week and on <br/>
3rd shift so for someone like me who LOVES to letterbox it's just <br/>
the time constraint that compels me to get the drive bys or the <br/>
quickies. So I put this out there to everyone in CT...<br/>
If you know of any mystery boxes that once you solve them they are <br/>
fairly quick to find....<br/>
PLEASE LET ME KNOW SO I CAN JOIN IN ON THE MYSTERY FUN FUN FUN.<br/>

Fox Mystery) which takes some thinking of its own.  Within it, is <br/>
hidden 3 clues for boxes.  Each of the boxes contain a clue for a <br/>
bonus box, AND if you read the clues right, you will uncover another <br/>
mystery box.  Now, I thought this would delight boxers out there, <br/>
however, only one person has recorded a find.  I agree with you that <br/>
many people would rather be led straigt to the box, but there are <br/>
some of us that long for the thrill of the hunt.<br/>
