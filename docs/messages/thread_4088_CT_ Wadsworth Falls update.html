We had a wonderfully warm, wet, and muddy hike today - complete with a couple of a tumbles, of course! - at Wadsworth Falls starting from Laurel Grove Road. We would like to share a few points from our experience.<br/>
<br/>
1. The water is very high and beautiful!<br/>
2. The trails are muddy - in some places frozen under the muddy surface, and in some about 6 squishy inches deep!<br/>
3. Bridges are slippery even when not icy!<br/>
4. Most importantly: the trails have been recently and beautifully re-blazed. Unfortunately, some routes have changed, and some COLORS HAVE CHANGED!!! This had a major impact on some of the clues we followed today, and these planters have been contacted, but if you have boxes out there, you may wish to go maintain your boxes and update your clues.<br/>
<br/>
There is a 2005 Middletown Trail Guide posted online (and linked in some letterbox clues) - it is no longer 100% accurate (especially WRT trail blaze colors), but still somewhat useful to help you not get lost!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Holidays to all!<br/>
