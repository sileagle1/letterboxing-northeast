little bit of pace measuring to set initially, but it was right on <br/>
when we had them for the Relay for Life last year (on a 1/4 mile <br/>
track).  I don't remember how much they cost, but check the website. <br/>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>I tried measuring my paces at first, but that didn't work as well as <br/>
going on a trail of a pre-determined length then using the pedometer <br/>
to count paces.  Do the division and it comes up with your stride <br/>
and the average tends to be more accurate than measure 100 feet and <br/>
walking or something like that.<br/>
