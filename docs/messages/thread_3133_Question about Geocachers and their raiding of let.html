You could try what I do with the blue-rimmed Rubbermaid letterboxes <br/>
I use: first I use a Sharpie to write "This is a Letterbox. This is <br/>
NOT a Geocache! Remove NOTHING from this box!" on the outside clear <br/>
part of the lid. Then I trace what I wrote (now backwards) on the <br/>
INSIDE of the lid, so that even if the outside wears off the inside <br/>
is still there.<br/>
<br/>
As I make my own logbooks and usually design my covers on the <br/>
computer, I include a similar, though longer message on the cover of <br/>
the logbook.<br/>
<br/>
You could also use some kind of tether to attach the stamp and <br/>
logbook to the inside of the letterbox, although that would negate <br/>
the waterproofing qualities of the ziploc bags. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
In the event things still go awry, you could post a message on the <br/>
geocaching boards, asking the knuckleheads to put the stamp back in <br/>
your letterbox.<br/>

<br/>
They ought not be! After all, they're playing our game with their <br/>
rules, and that's not right. They need to be set straight. They need <br/>
to know the differences in the game. Just as some people don't mark <br/>
their 'boxes as NOT CACHES, some people don't bother to think that <br/>
not every container they find hidden in the woods is a cache.<br/>
<br/>
I can handle a little rudeness in this situation. I can give it back <br/>
just as good as I can take it. Especially if I want my stamp back!<br/>

letterboxes.  I have a GPSr and check the geocaching site for near <br/>
by caches.  Then I find the caches and see how far they are <br/>
seperated from my box.  The closest one I found is only 100 feet.  I <br/>
could have planted my box further for safety.  I would want 300 to <br/>
500 feet seperation to avoid accidental discovery.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>This phenomenon seems to be related to the following instances.<br/>
<br/>
1) Placement overlap<br/>
<br/>
By this I mean that either the cache was first or the box first, or<br/>
they both overlap and neither the two shall ever meet unless the minds<br/>
think alike. I believe I posted to this list a short while ago my<br/>
experience when placing a box in the Wiscasset area. I had thought<br/>
long and hard about the Nickels-Sortwell sunken garden spot. Lo and<br/>
behold, the day that I go to install my box, the EXACT spot that I<br/>
decided upon had a geocache already there! I was astounded for many<br/>
reasons primarily because I made the assumption that cachers do not<br/>
always choose good spots, but in this case it was the perfect location<br/>
and I thought it unwise to plant a box and overlap the same spot. <br/>
<br/>
2) Online clues<br/>
<br/>
Both letterboxing and geocaching rely (exclusively in the case of<br/>
geocaching) on a web-based online format for clue distribution and<br/>
logging. I'm not saying this is bad, but it makes the clues easy to<br/>
get for boxers and cachers alike. So for instance, if someone on the<br/>
geocaching site decided that they didn't want a particular letterbox<br/>
in an area, then who is to say that someone couldn't go look up your<br/>
LBNA clue listing and remove the box? I'm not saying that a<br/>
letterboxer or cacher would do this, it's just an example of how<br/>
easily the clues can be obtained.<br/>
<br/>
Now, does either hobby promote the other? Well, not really, though I<br/>
believe the LBNA links listing might put geocaching there as does<br/>
Jeremy's geocaching site link to LBNA, but does that mean that the<br/>
participants go to the trouble to look up either clue areas? Probably<br/>
not. I would guess that there are many geocaches in the area that we<br/>
currently reside judging from reports from fellow boxers and just<br/>
knowing the type of people that live in this part of Maine, but there<br/>
are hardly any boxes. I'm not about to go and look up all the<br/>
geocaches, but I will take that into consideration if it seems as<br/>
though certain areas might already be populated.<br/>
<br/>
Finally...<br/>
<br/>
3) Growing hobby<br/>
<br/>
With the advent of the internet-based clue distribution as well as<br/>
media attention and magazine articles in everything from travel guides<br/>
to whatnot, there's no saying how many new players come into the fold<br/>
each year. Now if you think about the surrounding area you live and<br/>
the radius of clues, it can only get smaller and smaller as more and<br/>
more people enter the hobby and start placing. <br/>
<br/>
To answer your question, is there any way to let cachers know that our<br/>
hobby has different rules? Well, the steadfast rule of boxing is that<br/>
THERE ARE NO RULES... so if we as a community cannot even come to a<br/>
consensus about that rule first and foremost, there is no way that we<br/>
can expect the greater geocaching community to just "get it"... no?<br/>
<br/>
And finally, it's up to them and YOU as a responsible boxer to just<br/>
educate yourself about each hobby as much as you can with what<br/>
information is available, but don't expect that just because the rules<br/>
are out there that folks will actually read them or adhere to any<br/>
policies. The best insurance in my experience is to limit the access<br/>
to clues and make better judgements about box placement. There is no<br/>
need for a rash of new, poorly placed boxes in an area that is already<br/>
over-populated with caches and other boxes. Just my opinions on the<br/>
matter. I can't see this getting any better especially in southern maine.<br/>

A geocacher found one of our boxes lately, accidentally, while looking for a nearby geocache. He wrote to me to tell me that he found it, lid open, wet inside. He dried it out but thought I should go check it out because the lid doesn't serve it's purpose any more. I haven't been to check on it yet, but I sure did appreciate this kindness. <br/>
