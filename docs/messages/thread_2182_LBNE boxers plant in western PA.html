I know that some of you have ties to western PA and just wanted you to <br/>
know that The Aroostook Sleuth, Little Tag-a-long and Holster-roo <br/>
traveled there this past week and planted a series of 6 boxes in the <br/>
Childhood Adventure Club series honoring tag-a-long's and my  <br/>
childhood clubs growing up there.  They are all listed under their own <br/>
club names, near Apollo, in Westmoreland County.  Let us know what you <br/>
think if any of you venture that way.<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
