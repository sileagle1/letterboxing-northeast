----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
- This message has been sent from inside the matrix- it may be <br/>
monitored, but it is very important.----------------------------------<br/>
-------  In 1997, the Matrix program realized that too many humans <br/>
were being "freed" from it's grasp and it was starting to lose <br/>
control. Fearing that it would be rendered obsolete one day, it began <br/>
a program to hide vital components of it's core system within itself <br/>
so that the system could rebuild if necessary. The theory was simple: <br/>
hide the components in strategic locations and give them extra <br/>
shielding. If the system crashed, and the programming lines broke <br/>
down, these "shielded" components would all fall into place <br/>
automaticaly, link together, and rebuild and reboot instantly. It <br/>
would then repeat the process so that it could never be desroyed.-----<br/>
-----------However,in mid-1998, a loose group of rebels got wind of <br/>
this tactic from informational sources located in another part of the <br/>
program. They then formulated a plan of their own. From their base <br/>
camp, they could access on-line information that would act as a "map" <br/>
of sorts to the hidden components. They could then enter the Matrix <br/>
and use the maps or clues to locate them within the system. The <br/>
rebels decided that rather than destroy them, and risk them being <br/>
replaced stronger and more powerful, they would simply sabotage them <br/>
by overloading them with extra information. They would open them up <br/>
and do two things. First, they would record the component's unique <br/>
identifying marker-(each one has it's own)-and make a list of which <br/>
ones they had already been to. Second-- they would add their own text <br/>
lines or image to the component in it's data entry log. The idea was <br/>
that by overloading as many hidden components as possible, if and <br/>
when the system finally crashed and the backup fell into place, the <br/>
components wouldn't be able to link up and the system would come <br/>
crashing down. On that day we would all be free again.----------------<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
-------That was almost six years ago. Since then, the Matrix has <br/>
become aware of our attempts at sabotage and has gone into overdrive, <br/>
trying to wear us down by placing more and more new components every <br/>
day. Some are easy to find, others are hidden very well and require <br/>
more thought. Some people are already doing this and not even <br/>
realizing it, thinking it to simply be a hobby. However, the harsh <br/>
reality of it is that the machines are in control and every day is a <br/>
small war to regain our world. Ever since that fateful day in 1998, <br/>
our numbers have expanded greatly. More join the cause every day and <br/>
give us renewed hope that one day, when the dust has settled, we will <br/>
be in control again.--------------------------------------------------<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
----- If you are reading this message, there may still be hope. You <br/>
see, we have recently stumbled on a key component and it's location. <br/>
Due to the importance of this one piece, we need as many people to <br/>
help us as possible before the Matrix realizes we know of it. We fear <br/>
that if we are found out, the system may relocate the component in a <br/>
place that's harder to locate. Time is of the essence, and the <br/>
machines are closing in fast. As we are still receiving the <br/>
information ourselves, more messages will come with more detailed <br/>
information. I have to go----- stay tuned.</div>
