Even though the calendar says spring, we did find a nice bit of Winter!<br/>
What a nice little series.<br/>
We tried for the replanted Pirates Past Noon, but could only find the first box. Argh! Curses matey!<br/>
(Remember September 19th is talk like a Pirate Day.)<br/>
<br/>
We also got out to check on a few of our boxes and found Canonicut Canons to be doing fine,<br/>
BUT, Rhode Island Directions seems to have been cleaned up. It appears that someone did some brush clearing and the box is not where we left it. So, keep yours eyes open for a new box of appropriate theme and stamp in the future.<br/>
