event.  Grumpy and I had a very trying week with a sick family member, <br/>
so to be able to get together with friends and laugh and forget about <br/>
the outside world for a few hours was just what the Dr. ordered!  <br/>
Getting some great stuff at the raffle table wasn't so shabby either.  <br/>
I think Sunshine swiped one of our raffle tickets. I think it was the <br/>
one for the overnight stay at the Super 8. LOL<br/>
Thanks again,  <br/>
Grumpy and Hez</div>
