direction challenged person who loves this hobby and manages to tell <br/>
my left from my right (usually..) this helps me to orient myself and <br/>
judge length of walk and time to allow, more or less.<br/>
  When placing my Great Island l.b. (Wellfleet, Ma.) I used the park <br/>
signs to figure out milage and tried to let people know part of the <br/>
walk was rough. Pedometers don't work well for me as I am a bouncy <br/>
walker/uneven pacer.<br/>
    Any  pre-hunt clue a placer gives me, whether estimated time, <br/>
milage or "Easy/moderate" rating is deemed helpful.   <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-106294073">Hiya! Good question: like many others have said, we also use the <br/>
distances and times given by authors in their clues to match our own <br/>
time constraints. Since we often mountain bike our hikes, in our <br/>
early placing days we had lots of logbook comments along the lines <br/>
of "whoa! that was a LONG mile, guys." People still tell us that "if <br/>
you haven't found a Drewclan box you haven't gone far enough..." So <br/>
to give better distances we bought the very reasonably priced Topo! <br/>
map computer program from National Geographic. It's pretty cool: we <br/>
draw out our route and it gives nearly exact mileages and elevation <br/>
gains. Since most of our boxes are in Connecticut, with a high point <br/>
about 800' above sea level, elevation isn't much of a factor, but our <br/>
mileages should be pretty accurate. That's another option, especially <br/>
if you like fiddling with maps. For free, you might try the website <br/>
topozone dot com.<br/>

Anybody who has made that walk between #2 and #3 in Jay's "Blurred <br/>
Borders" series knows what this means. Yikes! Thank you, Jay.<br/>
