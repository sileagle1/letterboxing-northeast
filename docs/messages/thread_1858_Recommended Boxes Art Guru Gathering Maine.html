I have gotten a few e-mails about how much snow Maine has gotten and what <br/>
boxes are good to get.<br/>
Well the last storm did leave a chunck of snow and the cold weather has <br/>
been, well cold.  So here are the best boxes that I think you may have some <br/>
luck with but there are no garenties.<br/>
<br/>
Carpe Diem - this one might want to be chacked on the morning before the <br/>
gathering. :)<br/>
<br/>
Dizzy - I think that this one might be capable of getting at this time with the <br/>
snow.<br/>
<br/>
Smiling Dragon - I am not sure, but it seems to be worth a shot<br/>
<br/>
River of Our Love - I have not checked on this box this winter but it is not to <br/>
bad of a walk.<br/>
<br/>
Deering Oaks Rose Circle - Is worth a shot with the snow<br/>
<br/>
CBD's Origins Coffee Bar - Is for sure another good idea<br/>
<br/>
There will also be specail boxes planted on the day of the gathering for the <br/>
Gorham area.  Can't wait to see you all NEXT WEEK!!!!!<br/>

all the way down there from MDI, esp since I will be making the drive<br/>
down to Mass the following weekend. Have a great gathering and<br/>
hopefully the weather will stop being gruesome! I plan on stopping in<br/>
at your store some time (AFTER baby is born in April)...<br/>
