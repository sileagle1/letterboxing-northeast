I'd say if gas prices are that high maybe people's priorities should<br/>
be shifting towards what they can actually do for the environment<br/>
rather than leaving petroleum based products (only fueling the higher<br/>
gas prices) out in the wild.<br/>

In a related note....<br/>
Dave was out at _Acting the Goa_t this weekend for the view and brought home a very soggy logbook. It appears no one has been to visit in almost a year and the logbook was pretty full. We have dried it out and will be returning it to the owner. Dave didn't have any supplies with him (afterall he was only there for the view!) so he left a few slips of paper in the now dried out box. So, if you're planning on visiting this box before the planter can get there - go prepared with paper to leave your stamp impression.<br/>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>I went out and did my box maintenance in MA this past week, and over <br/>
this winter, a total of seven of my boxes in MA went missing or were so <br/>
bad I retired them.  I updated the clues on both LBNA and AQ.<br/>
<br/>
I only had to retire one in RI (Point Judith), but the others have <br/>
fared pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
You never quite know what you'll find when you do box maintenance ... I <br/>
try to do mine at least once a year and maybe even every six months if <br/>
it's a high traffic area.<br/>

Oh, dear!  That box was on my list of "to do" boxes for next weekend, <br/>
along with Alice in Wonderland.  Trying to do all the Mt. Tom boxes at <br/>
once.<br/>
<br/>
I've been out on the trails quite a bit lately, and it does seem like <br/>
box maintenance isn't a big priority.  I try to carry extra baggies, <br/>
paper towels, etc., when I go out, but there's only so much you can do, <br/>
especially when they are not your boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I'm on my spring planting binge again - five down and six more to go!<br/>

    I wanted to let people know that I plan on pulling the No! series in Wethersfield toward the end of this week.  I've had to recarve a number of the stamps since I planted them and had to replace the containers and rehide some.  I've finally come to the conclusion that the area is to busy (bikers, hikers, etc) and the town (or some group) is constantly clearing the woods.  I've replanted a couple of boxes due to a tree or part of a tree being cut down.<br/>
<br/>
  It is my hope that later in the spring, once I've recarved the missing stamps, that I'll find a new place to plant them.<br/>

Check with Chris at the EB Wolf Nature Center at the entrance to the <br/>
park.  He said he was using letterboxing as part of their children's <br/>

know what other problems may have happened.<br/>
