boxes, Hops and Devil.  Thanks to the Lovers for bringing us back. <br/>
Both boxes are fine and there was no snake at the Hopbox today, only <br/>
a skin!!!!!!!!!but the Devil box held a HH- a great surprise! <br/>
Wonderful stamps, guys!!  Drewclan's second box is indeed missing, <br/>
but the hike to the vista is worthwhile even so!!!  We then went home <br/>
for lunch and then out to Selden creek for Nancy's two.  Creepy <br/>
Crawly and Bear are both fine.  Love the tree the first one is <br/>
in :0)  Happy Boxing to all!! Sunshine, Swamp Yankee and the ToadDog</div>
