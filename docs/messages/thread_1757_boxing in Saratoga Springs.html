and I to find 3 boxes up in Saratoga Springs this lovely MLK weekend. I <br/>
am extremely grateful for the plethora of warm stores selling hot <br/>
chocolate in the area as well as to the planters of the boxes listed <br/>
below. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's Party is in good shape. The ink pad is starting to bead up and <br/>
fall apart, but the ink still works.<br/>
<br/>
Fountain of Youth is also fine, though the seeker is considerably more <br/>
exposed to the public in winter than it appears they would be in <br/>
summer. I don't believe anyone saw us get the box, but the hiding spot <br/>
isn't very hidden with no leaves on the trees.<br/>
<br/>
Final Exam. Well, we found the box and stamped into the logbook, but <br/>
the stamp itself is missing.<br/>
<br/>
Box on!<br/>
