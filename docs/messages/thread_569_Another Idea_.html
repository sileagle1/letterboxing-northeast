<br/>
Well - I had another idea. Sue thinks I'm crazy but after almost 30<br/>
years of marriage, nothing really surprises her anymore!<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to devote a page on our website for your individual first<br/>
box - that initial find that got you started.<br/>
<br/>
We can do this through email - just send me your trail name, State in<br/>
which you live, the box name, State in which it's located &amp; the date,<br/>
including the year.<br/>
<br/>
I think we all may get a kick out of learning everyone's first box as<br/>
well as when and where it was. Be advised: if you email me, I will<br/>
post this info on the website so if you are not interested in having<br/>
this info on a website, please do not respond. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!! [I know I am!!! ;-)]<br/>

block to screen left (between Links &amp; Polls).  But I don't see one <br/>
here?  If we had a database you wouldn't need to collect and make <br/>
entries, we could do so individually.  The Database format would just <br/>
need to be created.  Can the owner or moderator explain why this <br/>
group doesn't have access to a Database?<br/>

</span></blockquote>Because as it's implemented in Yahoo Groups, the database is simply <br/>
awful.  A disgrace.  It's hard to use, slow, and not very <br/>
extendable.  If you put in a thousand entries, it's gonna run slower <br/>
than a three-toed sloth.<br/>
<br/>
Databases are wonderful tool, but not the ones on these talk lists.<br/>
<br/>
However....  I have already been swapping e-mails with Mark about <br/>
ways to allow users to enter boxes themselves without intervention <br/>
on his part.  I think he secretly has too much time on his hands and <br/>
wants something to do, though.  ;o)<br/>
