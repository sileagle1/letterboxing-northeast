                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1859143095">The only box of this series that is missing is box # 1 "Two Hearts."  We found a remnant of the old log book in the forest floor debris.  We have replanted a temp replacement box but have not found a stamp that I thought would be good enough.  I'm still looking.  If you decide to seek this series, I'll gladly give you clues to that box to log in but you will not have an image just yet.<br/>
<br/>
The other 3 are just fine, other than the original stamps were removed (somehow) from 2 of them but were replaced with other stamps.<br/>
<br/>
The final box was soaked through. The log book was so wet that the pages could not be turned, the cover was off, the spiral binding rusted to the baggy, and there was mildew on many pages. We put in a temporary log book.<br/>
<br/>
Months of trying to get a response from Greta and Jeremy or Jeremy's dad have failed.  The Beaudoins of MA and Team Safari (we) have been planning on refurbishing and adopting, and have permission from one of the webmasters to do so.  <br/>
<br/>
If ANYONE can tell us how to get a message to them *personally* please send it to Team Safari.  I have the last log book all dried out and it really can't be placed back in the box with any expectation of it surviving more trauma.  There is a nice message between the couple in this log, and many well wishes from visitors. Even though many messages and stamp images were ruined there are quite a few that are readable.  This is a treasure.  It should not become trash unless the couple decides to get rid of it, IMHO.  I will not let it become bits of trash in the leaves like log book #1. This final box is the only one with the original stamp.<br/>
<br/>
The original 4 stamps were all store bought but apropos.<br/>
<br/>
The park and chasm are still a very nice place to hike and climb or rappell.  There are a few geocaches in there as well.<br/>
<br/>
If I ever find stamps that match the originals I will buy them, and finish this project, and my box rescue partner in MA will oversee their care until the owners decide to reclaim the series.  This series was special to me for a couple of reasons.  It was the first letterboxing venture I went on with Betz, so I'll do what I can to preserve it.  Should they (the Disches) deside to retire and remove the series, we'll probably plant something of our own.<br/>
