We are looking for Frankenstein on the Loose HH by The Chichlid Guy and Monster Mash Traveler by Steve, Heidi and Madras. These two were only to travel to Monster Mash boxes. All the boxes have been picked up and they are not in any of the retrieved boxes. As a matter of fact, only 2 HH were in all the boxes which is disappointing as we hoped to send some HH back to the monster makers. Anyone having any information about these two hitchhikers please contact me off list. To have this month of monster hunting end successfully, we need to return these to the monster makers.......Chuck and Molly<br/>

I have to crawl out of the woodwork for a second to say, WOW!  All <br/>
that work you've already done and you're doing a gallery and hunting <br/>
down hh's, too.  <br/>
<br/>
I know it's been said before, but I have to chime in and say, thank <br/>
you, thank you.  You're amazing. <br/>

were quite a few images in the logbooks themselves. We desperately <br/>
want ours back should someone find it. It's a shame that the big bold <br/>
directions on the front of the logbook were apparently tough to <br/>
follow and somehow its either in another non-MMM box in Mansfield or <br/>
someone's pack. <br/>

If you have this critter, please contact us or Chuck to arrange for a <br/>
safe return!<br/>
