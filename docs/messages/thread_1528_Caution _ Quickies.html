                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2145258306">I have to say, after reading the latest cautionary posts that when I mentioned it to my husband he was in quite a tiff about going to Mansfield today...after making a few phone calls to see what areas allowed hunting we took off. Orange vest, jingle bell and an orange kerchief tied around our daughter. We thought we'd be safe as she sings, skips and talks endlessly out on the trails and the rustle of leaves from the three of us made it difficult to hear each other speak, we thought we'd certainly be noticed, sight and sound!<br/>
<br/>
While stamping in at Wife of Dracula we heard a shot and it freaked us all out, as this is not  a hunting area! We started shouting, "stop shooting" and "we are here!" , two more shots, in the distance mind you, and more shouting, more fervently from us and it stopped. We made it out of there pretty quickly, but DEFINITELY got our stamp first!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think I'll stick to drive bys for the next few months. <br/>
