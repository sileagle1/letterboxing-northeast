I'll admit that I haven't lived in Riverside in years (since the early 80's) but I had no idea that it <br/>
had turned into a party place.  It never was through the 50's, 60's, and up to the late 70's.  <br/>
That is such a shame.<br/>
<br/>
I'll never forget the day that I hunted "Louff Carousel" and "Morty" (deep winter).  It brought <br/>
back so many memories of shore dinners and the rides at Crescent Park, and I have family <br/>
buried in Little Neck as well that I got to visit that day.<br/>
