Thanks! so Much for the update on the Boomerang HH, glad to see it's traveled far since 2003. I've traveled far myself, &amp; now reside in northern VT.  Hope you can connect with Butterfly while she's out in Madison.<br/>

Happy Trails,<br/>

It would be way cool to meet you . Yes, we will be in Madison on Thursday , Friday and part of Sat - perhaps even stay over night on Sat as well ??/ We will be with my niece's  , and I will send you their address -- Adrien and Hilary Joyner <br/>

My grand daughter lives in Minneapolis where I will be for 10 days .  There will be a little mini gather there on Sunday . It is on the Minnesota Message board on AQ  with people writing and saying they will join us , it sounds like a fun time .<br/>
 <br/>
I can not remember all the trail names ,  Heaven [my grand daughter ] use to go by Heaven's Dream -- a cute stamp she carved .  A heart with wings. --- Adrien I think uses a turtle she carved, and Hilary  carved a giraffe . I think Adrien may have boxed a little in Madison , but Hilary just moved there after graduating from UN of AZ ., so don't think she has boxed yet in Madison .?  <br/>
Keep in touch , we have a month yet to plan !<br/>
