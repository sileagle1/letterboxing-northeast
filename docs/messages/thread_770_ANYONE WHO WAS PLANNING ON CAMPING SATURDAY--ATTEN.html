and I'm not sure how he is doing, but according to the reply I <br/>
recieved from the park, there will be camping. Here's the deal--- #1--<br/>
Music Woman has arranged a meeting with the park officials at 3:00pm <br/>
to determine if it is possible to issue a group permit to us. If you <br/>
want to camp out, plan on attending this meeting.  #2-- if you ARE <br/>
planning on camping out, you need to e-mail Music Woman directly at: <br/>
<a href="mailto:mindizney@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">mindizney@...</a>  to express your interest. This is important <br/>
because it will give her a preliminary head count to give to the park <br/>
office. Your immediate and timely response is greatly appreciated.    <br/>
#3-- PARKING****  There will be an extreme shortage of parking for <br/>
the gathering IN the park, due mainly to the fact that there will be <br/>
a wedding taking place at the same time as the gathering.  The park <br/>
has requested that we use the parking lot at either the high school <br/>
across the street or down the road at the Danbury Fair mall. They <br/>
would like us to carpool into the park if possible. After the <br/>
wedding, we'll probably be able to park right in the park.  This is <br/>
all the information I was told to provide. I think we still have a <br/>
better than average chance of pulling this off if we all just beg <br/>
ALOT and look really sad.  Crossing my fingers  ---Northstar</div>
