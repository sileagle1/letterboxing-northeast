With this site covering many states in the Northeast I sometimes have <br/>

Camden---well is this Conn. or N.J.?  Is N.J. part of the Northeast <br/>

</span></blockquote>First of all, who cares? Honestly, it doesn't matter. You're here on<br/>
this list because you live in the northeast and you letterbox.<br/>
Welcome! And hopefully you're having fun :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I do have one issue I'd like to address.  <br/>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>Now, as for your questions and comment regarding the state of origin.<br/>
Good point!!! Folks on this list sort of take for granted that<br/>
everyone knows what state, but even that aside - I have pointed out<br/>
that there is a Portland, Connecticut and a Portland, Maine.<br/>
<br/>
And, to kill two birds with the same stone so to speak, I designed the<br/>
LBNE patch and there was a poll on this talk list regarding which<br/>
states to include. Currently, our patch inclues Maine, New York,<br/>
Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Therefore,<br/>
when Rubaduc was posting about Camden the other day, she meant Camden,<br/>
Maine on the coast.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn't mean that you can't disuss other states across the<br/>
country in the "Northeast" talk list, it just means that our<br/>
discussions primarily focus on those states. I hardly ever hear from<br/>
folks in NJ, but I do know that Martian Maggot is from that area and<br/>
she's currently in Unity, Maine as well as TeamGreenDragon who will be<br/>
moving to New Jersey soon! So, I'm sure that New Jersey will be on the<br/>
map soon :)<br/>
<br/>
Hope that answers some of your questions!<br/>
