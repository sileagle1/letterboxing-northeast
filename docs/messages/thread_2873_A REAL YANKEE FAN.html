It is my opinion that ALL carved stamps are works of art even if the carver <br/>
feels it didn't come out well. <br/>
<br/>
I was just pulling your chain with the "store bought" comment. This <br/>
insinuation was in reference to the perception that the Yankees buy their championships <br/>
and very little of their talent is "home grown." Arguably, New England (LBNE) <br/>
is predominately Red Sox country and no one can slip in a Yankee reference <br/>
without some good-natured ribbing. I'm apologize if I offended you. I'm sure <br/>
that this is a great box and I can't wait for my next trip up to Southern Maine <br/>
to get it along with all your other placements in and around York.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day!<br/>

</span></blockquote>  Hi everyone.  I generally just lurk here, but thought I'd pipe up and say, <br/>
  I've found A Real Yankee Fan.  I got a real kick out of it.  Go look for it if you're in the area.  I'd say more, but don't want to ruin the experience for anyone.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
  And it's a perfectly nice carving.  Glad you got new markers out there, though.<br/>
