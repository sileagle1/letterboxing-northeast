if you want to give it a try, click on the image.  (It is clickable!)<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, it's not actually in the Northeast, but I thought the <br/>
stamp seemed appropriate for you Yankee acorns.  ;o)  You know, with <br/>
the rich sea-faring history and seeing as it's a hand-carved stamp <br/>
making it appropriate for the hobby as well.<br/>
<br/>
I'd still like to replace that picture with a REAL picture taken <br/>
somewhere in the northeast--perferably where one or more letterboxes <br/>
exist that the picture could link to the clue for.  Any takers?<br/>

</span></blockquote>Actually, I already got a volunteer for a picture which I just put <br/>
up a few hours ago.  =)  But you can hang on to the picture, because <br/>
it'll be nice to rotate it every now and then.  It's a very manual <br/>
process, though, so it's not going to happen very often.  Perhaps <br/>
every few months?  I don't know.  Just whenever.  =)<br/>
