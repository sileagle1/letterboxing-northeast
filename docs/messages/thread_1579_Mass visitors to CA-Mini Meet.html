California yesterday! Made even more beautiful by the lovely spirits <br/>
of Deanne and Dave from Mass! What a fun couple of letterboxers! <br/>
<br/>
Mimulus, Paul from SF. 3vix and we two gathered for a several-box <br/>
hunt, most of them Mimulus's fabulous stamps and another splenid one <br/>
from Paul.<br/>
<br/>
To those of you easterners who know or have boxed with Deanne and <br/>
Dave you know why we instantly fell in love with them. Lovely people <br/>
they are! Thanks for sharing them with us out here on the LEFT coast. <br/>
And thanks for taking the time to box with us, Dave and "Luvvy"!<br/>
<br/>
For those of you in the vicinity, seek out any boxes in the wine <br/>
country carved by Mimulus and ANY by Paul from SF. You won't be <br/>
disappointed!<br/>
