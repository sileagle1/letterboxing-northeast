Gather! Thanks Alan, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. I prepped for the <br/>
event saturday morning by doing IrishCOD's "Celtic Pride" series in <br/>
New Milford" Wonderful trail system with some nice stamps. After <br/>
settling in at the Gather, it was off to do the TP+M series.The hike <br/>
was made more pleasant with the company of Phynstar as a hiking <br/>
partner. Thanks Phynstar! The event stamps were fabulous and it was <br/>
wonderful to see old and new friends. Our good luck with the weather <br/>
finally ended this morning while Phynstar and I went in search <br/>
of "Fox View" and the DEP Pootatuck State Forest stamp. Regretfully <br/>
the State stamp has gone missing. I will try to get hold of the <br/>
forester. Thanks to all for making the weekend so nice. Safe Trails!<br/>
