<br/>
Warrior Woman &amp; I found Breaking Hearts at Breakheart yesterday.  <br/>
This box is over 6 years old and is said to be the first planted box <br/>
in Rhode Island (uncomfirmed.)  It was fun to be a part of <br/>
letterboxing history.  Reading some of the old entries in the log was <br/>
especially exciting. The box is in great shape.<br/>
<br/>
We went all over Washington county yesterday and found:<br/>
<br/>
A day in the life:  Boxes 1, 2, 3, 4.  (Could not find box 5.)<br/>
Live &amp; Breathe:  Box # 1.  This box is also 6 years old &amp; a bit moldy.<br/>
Lucky Charms: all 7 boxes in great shape.<br/>
Wendigo: looking good!<br/>
His Growth: also in fine shape.<br/>
<br/>
Boxes that eluded us:<br/>
Ghoti (mystery)<br/>
Cave Dweller # 2<br/>
<br/>
All &amp; all a great day!<br/>
