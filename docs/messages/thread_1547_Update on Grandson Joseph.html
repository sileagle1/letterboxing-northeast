<br/>
He was born last Wed evening, a month early but doing very well!  We new ahead of time that he had spina bifida and water on the brain so we were prepared.  On Friday he had surgery to closr the opening on his spine and insert a shunt so the fluid will drain from around his brain.  Both procedures went well and he is recovering splendidly!<br/>
<br/>
As my daughter said to me........there's good news and bad news;  the bad news is that when they went to repair the area where the spinal cord was protruding they realized that that was where the spinal cord ended.  As a result he will never be able to walk.  The good news is that they feel pretty certain that there is no brain damage because of the water on the brain.  At this point they feel he should develop normally.  Of course things could become more obvious as he grows and develops, but they said that any learning disability would probably be so slight that only family would ever know it was there!<br/>
<br/>
So, even though it is sad that he will never walk, it is truly wonderful that he should be fine otherwise!<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank everyone you emailed me and expressed their concern and support for Joseph!  You are all great people!<br/>
