There are no boxes in Baxter State Park nor are there boxes allowed in<br/>
Acadia National Park. ANP because of obvious reasons, and<br/>
Baxter...well, it's been something I've thought about since the day I<br/>
started boxing. I think it's wonderful that there are no boxes in this<br/>
state park. It's as though it is sacred land off limits in a sense.<br/>
I'm not sure why, perhaps it is the remote area, it is also mostly<br/>
used by locals.<br/>
<br/>
I am happy for that. There are plenty of boxes in Southern Maine for<br/>
everyone to enjoy, and not nearly enough people visit the County.<br/>
Here's to the Aroostook Sleuth and the other folks in northern parts<br/>
of maine for putting that area on the map.<br/>

See you folks at the gathering!<br/>

It may have been removed, but I remember that the last time we were up <br/>
in Bar Harbor, there was one box in Baxter.  On the way home we were <br/>
going to attempt it, but didn't want to pay to enter for just the short <br/>
time it would have taken to get the box.<br/>
<br/>
Does it ring any bells for anyone?<br/>
