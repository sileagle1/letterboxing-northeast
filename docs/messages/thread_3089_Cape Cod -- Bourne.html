<br/>
We returned from a relaxing week at the Bourne Scenic Park in Cape <br/>
Cod, MA yesterday and are pleased to report a return to letterboxing <br/>
after a bit of a hiatus over the past year!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We found the following in good condition:<br/>
<br/>
Nanjan<br/>
Railroad Bridge<br/>
Herring Run<br/>
Belmont Rock<br/>
Sail Away<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately our busy schedule of relaxing, biking, shopping, etc <br/>
prevented us from venturing much fartherm, but it was still nice to <br/>
get out and find some boxes.  Its been almost a year since we had <br/>
time to do that, and the canal was a nice place to start because <br/>
Garrett was able to come with us in the jogging stroller and/or the <br/>
Burley trailer.<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trails!<br/>
