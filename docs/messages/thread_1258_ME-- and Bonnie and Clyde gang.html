of boxes in the All Things Aroostook series and a HH (The Boxing<br/>
Turtle) to boot!  Thanks for planting those great stamps depicting THE<br/>
COUNTY.  You did a wonderful job of placing them where they would not<br/>
be discovered accidently especially since there are so many of them in<br/>
one lovely area.  Definitely worth the effort!!<br/>
