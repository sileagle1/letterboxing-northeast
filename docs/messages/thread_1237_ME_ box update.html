Katahdin Iron Works - alive and well, last visited by Wanda on 8.31.04<br/>
Recarved 4 of the missing Portland Series stamps:<br/>
#4 - Forest City<br/>
#7 - Portland Public Library<br/>
#8 - MECA<br/>
#9 - PMA <br/>
#12 is also missing, just needs to be recarved.<br/>
<br/>
These will be replaced next weekend. I would safely say that Sunday, Sep. 12th might <br/>
be a great time to add these items to your logs. There are still a few that I have not <br/>
confirmed active or missing. <br/>
<br/>
Also finally got around to the Seashore box clues. There are 2 new ones listed under <br/>
our files section. <br/>

box in Bath, Maine. It is alive and well, and has been found recently!<br/>
Thank you to those that inquired and for Oceanwytch and her replant<br/>
efforts.<br/>
<br/>
The Robyville Covered bridge in Kenduskeag is alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
The State Bird Stamp sadly has gone missing, unless it was moved from<br/>
it's original location. I couldn't find it at all -! That will be<br/>
replaced in due time.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I've also received many inquiries into Portland boxes. I have<br/>
no idea on the status of the following boxes:<br/>
- East End Series<br/>
- East End log (box #15)<br/>
- Fort Allen Park<br/>
- Deering Oaks Rose Circle<br/>
- Bug Light<br/>
<br/>
I have confirmed that the observatory is missing, and Spring Point<br/>
Light is currently being renovated (!) Until I have a chance to drive<br/>
down through southern maine I cannot confirm the other boxes. Any<br/>
local folks up to some box maintenance? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who send me updates.<br/>
I'm sure I've forgotten to mail out some wom's but, please just send<br/>
me a reminder now and then! I've got many addresses to keep track of...<br/>
