Pawtucket.  After heading to City Park in Warwick, we quickly found <br/>
Smiling Tree and afterwards, Brushneck Cove.  We drove a bit and <br/>
later found Low Tide (the geese kept a VERY close eye on us!).<br/>
<br/>
We went to a Paw Sox game and saw them win in the 9th inning, 2 outs <br/>
and and RBI brought the score to 4-3.  After, we went to Slater Park <br/>
and found Fox in the Box.  We went off to find Fanny's Footsteps, but <br/>
got very confused and gave up after a very long search.<br/>
<br/>
How is everybody? Seems like there's a bunch of new boxers to meet <br/>
and exchange with!!  Sorry we wern't able to get to the MH Gathering <br/>
today...us Rhode Islanders don't like those oh-so-long drives!!  I <br/>
have a lot of reading on this list to catch up on!!  Hope to hear <br/>
from a few of you soon.<br/>

P.S. If anyone would be interested in finding Fanny's Footsteps with <br/>
us, e-mail us at <a href="mailto:buddyandpigtographer@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">buddyandpigtographer@...</a> -- the box is <br/>
located in Slater Park, Pawtucket, RI.  There's also one other <br/>
letterbox (which we found today) in the park.<br/>

I'm originally from RI and moved to MA in '83.  I couldn't stand it!  <br/>
Now I have a house in MA and a house in RI so I can do the best of <br/>
both worlds.<br/>

p.s.  Anyone boxing in The Great Swamp area be forewarned - the poor <br/>
baby beached whale that died recently was buried there.  Trekking for <br/>
Dog Days of Summer and Adventures of TinTin were, ahem, memorable.<br/>
