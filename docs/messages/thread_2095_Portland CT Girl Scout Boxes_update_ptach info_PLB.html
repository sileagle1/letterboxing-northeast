Thanks for all the supporters who bought patches! We only need to sell 7 more to break even, but we have plenty left! So let me know if you want one...see Mark Pepe's site for a pix, they're cute!<br/>
<br/>
I can't wait to see who has stopped by, the girls will be so thrilled to read the messages from 'real' letterboxers! <br/>
<br/>
Did anyone see the article in the Portland section of last week's Rivereast News?<br/>
<br/>
I am going to make the Event Stamp for the day of the gathering into a PLB for all those who came to Portland to find the Girl Scout boxes. If you came here and found the boxes AND if you are interested in receiving this PLB, send me your snail mail address off list. (For all you other wonderful PLBers, when the box comes back from round one, perhaps we'll send it out to out-of-staters!)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

Funny you should post about these today. I went out and did them this<br/>
morning, and they are all fine. Great series, the girls should be very proud<br/>
of themselves. I would love to buy a patch. How do I go about it? And I<br/>
would also like to be included in the plb. Please sign me up!<br/>

We planted them in early April and have posted messages since then reminding people to find them. I posted clues on the LBNE message board and Mark Pepe posted them on his site. Sorry! We're going out to collect them tomorrow morning and get them back to the troops who created them do they can check out the log books before the year ends for them.<br/>
