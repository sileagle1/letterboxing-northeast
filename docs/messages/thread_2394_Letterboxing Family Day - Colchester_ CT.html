<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Parks and Recreation Department of Colchester is holding a Letterboxing Family Day at the Comstock Covered Bridge in Colchester to introduce people to letterboxing.  The event will be held this Sunday, September 25.  Tables will be set by the Salmon River to hand out brochures, help kids make stamps and get families interested in letterboxing right in their own backyard.  The clues to my Petroglyphs Series will be made available.  The Fall Flyer, which includes the event, has been sent in the local papers to Colchester residents.  Colchester was named by Money Magazine as one of the top 100 cities to live in  - Number 57.  An event stamp will be made in honor of this wonderful accomplishment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you havenÂ’t done any letterboxing at this location or if you just want come and stamp into the Event logbook, stop by and say hi. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and Enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
