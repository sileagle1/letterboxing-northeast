It appears that Mona set her stamp down at a box somewhere and forgot <br/>
to pick it up.  It's a store bought stamp with a wooden handle and <br/>
it's got a little doggy footprint on it.  If anyone finds it, would <br/>
you please let me know.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

of us is getting senile. :)</div>

 <br/>
I also brought a new boxer out with me, Chavi.  It was her first series, and I think she is hooked already<br/>
