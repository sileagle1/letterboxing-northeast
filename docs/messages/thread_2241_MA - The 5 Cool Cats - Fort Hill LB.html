<br/>
Went to the new Fort Hill LB/geocache hybrid today.  Nice hiding spot &amp; <br/>
hand-carved stamp.  Seeing these clues jogged my memory about another <br/>
Fort Hill LB that had been placed a few or so years ago.  I finally <br/>
found the clues to the old box hidden in the basement archives, so I <br/>
decided to try for that box as well while I was there.<br/>
<br/>
What a fantastic box!  The walk is gorgeous &amp; the clues are just <br/>
phenomenal.  It seems a shame to have that box's clues just sitting in <br/>
the basement.  From what I read in the basement posts, many attempts <br/>
were made to contact the placers of the boxes that reside down there to <br/>
no avail.  I would love to adopt this box, but would truly like to have <br/>
the blessings of the original placers to do so.<br/>
<br/>
I am posting this message here &amp; on the big list hoping that The 5 Cool <br/>
Cats will contact me about their box.  Does anyone know if they are <br/>
still lbing?  Please if you're out there, let me know if I could adopt <br/>
this box.  I will wait a week or so &amp; if I do not hear, I will assume <br/>
they are no longer active boxers &amp; adopt this orphan.  Any help or info <br/>
from anyone that knows them would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
