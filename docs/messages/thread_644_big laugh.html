That was a GREAT letter with Rules that were even greater. !!  you gave <br/>
me such a big giggle just when I needed it.  <br/>
Actually,  I drove Bluebird to the gather and just about then  she  said <br/>
we needed to get going soon , so when I told you we would be gone when <br/>
you got back, I really was telling the truth ;-)  the real fun was the <br/>
way it worked out and I would not change a bit of the story :-D    We <br/>
letterboxers do tend to stretch the truth now and then.<br/>
However, in your rule #2-- I might question that you got wet in the <br/>
forest, as we  hikers know,  it does not rain in the forest,  therefore, <br/>
you must have gotten wet while walking on the roads.  <br/>
All the other rules are fine and should not be broken.<br/>
Thanks muchly.  I need you to write some clues for me !!<br/>
