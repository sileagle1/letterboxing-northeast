                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1013823012">~Today my husband and I took our three pups for a great walk at the dog park. We were checking up on our 12 boxes there as we had had a couple of missing reports.<br/>
<br/>
  The good news-all were found 8-)<br/>
<br/>
  The bad news-most were not hidden completely and all of them were missing most of their inner baggies. 8-(<br/>
<br/>
  The two that were reported missing:<br/>
Goldendoodle-in great shape and where it belongs<br/>
and<br/>
Old English Bulldog-in bad shape and now retired. <br/>
We found its hiding spot and the rocks were strewn all over the ground. We looked around and found the bottom of the box- full of water. Then we found the lid with one tab chewed off. A little ways away we found the baggies (chewed), then the log book (soaked and chewed) and finally the stamp (minus its backing and chewed). I think a critter was mighty persistent.<br/>
Well, after the poor pup went through all that (losing an ear, a paw and his tail and being left out in the elements) we decided to let him retire. Dog Park life was just not for him.<br/>
<br/>
He will probably get a new log book and hitchhike around the country now. <br/>
