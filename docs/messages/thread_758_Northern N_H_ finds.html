Slopes Inn" l.b. in Nth. Conway. As we emerged onto the main trail, <br/>
Team Green Dragon appoached, clue sheet in hand. Small world indeed!  <br/>
When stamping in, we discovered that Tweety/Mr. Coon  and Mary <br/>
Manatee/Yacht's man had visited the area a few days before. Though <br/>
their stamp-ins were present at every box I visited, our timing was <br/>
such that I missed meeeting them.<br/>
  Along with "Eastern Slopes", we visited "Black Cap". Incredible <br/>
panoramic views of the White Mt.s for a most managable climb. Highly <br/>
recommended hike (and l.b.). Box in fine shape, though logbook has <br/>
about a dozen pages left (one side of the pages stamped <br/>
into). "Cathedral Ledge" series consists of 3 nicely carved stamps <br/>
that fit together to form one image. I had some trouble finding the <br/>
second box, but persistance prevailed.  My last successful find <br/>
was "Diana's Baths" l.b., also in Nth. Conway. Adorable stamp and a <br/>
heavenly spot for our Memorial Day picnic before heading back home. <br/>
  "Glen Ellis Falls" l.b:  I feel confident in stating this box is <br/>
gone. The clues are clearcut and I found the empty hiding spot. What <br/>
a shame! <br/>
  "Thompson's Falls" l.b.: I feel fairly confident that this box is <br/>
gone. Hopfully, someone can allay my suspicions by commenting that it <br/>
is there or pulled for repairs. <br/>
  So, I found 4 out of the 6 boxes sought, reluctant letterboxing <br/>
partner in tow. More importantly, due to the placement of these boxes <br/>
we visited some slices of peaceful heaven on earth. <br/>

You just took me on a quick trip down memory lane. Some of the boxes you <br/>
mentioned were among the first boxes that Culex and I ever did a little <br/>
less than a year ago. They definitely were great spots. We also did not <br/>
find Glen Ellis Falls (that one we searched for with Phyto and <br/>
Isosceles). At one point we were in touch with the placer and he was <br/>
going to go and check on it. We never heard anything back and the clue <br/>
remained up so we assumed we just couldn't find it (though we scoured <br/>
the area pretty thoroughly and as you said the clues are straight <br/>
forward). Let me know what you find out about it's status if you hear <br/>
back from the placer.<br/>
