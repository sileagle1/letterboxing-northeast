                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1437699450">My husband (Son of a Sailor) got an email that the stamp from the Kenniston Covered Bridge is missing.  The message only said the "stamp" not sure about the box and we were unable to reply to the sender (Faith Shannon).  If anyone who has been there would kindly check their packs and see if they accidentally took it we'd appreciate it.  Hopefully we can get out there soon to check it out.  Faith, if you read this, let us know if it was only the stamp or the box too.<br/>

Thanks,<br/>
