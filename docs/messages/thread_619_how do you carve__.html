<br/>
Try The Art Experience.  It is a really excellent art supply warehouse. 6 Kiddie Drive, Avon.  They are in the Industrial Park across from First Years.  Just go through the gate at the bottom of the hill. They have carving tools and the Speedball pink stuff.  They also have a huge array of erasers ranging in price.  That should get you started.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck and Happy Carving!<br/>

the process a bit.  At the end I also included links for other great <br/>
resources on how to carve stamps.  (I myself learned how to carve <br/>
from Der Mad Stamper's website, listed in the references.  Very good <br/>
stuff!)<br/>
