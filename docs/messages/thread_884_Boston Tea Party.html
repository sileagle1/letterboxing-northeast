boxnum=8340&amp;boxname=Boston_Tea_Party)?  We went searching for it and <br/>
think we've got the right spot, but are suspicious that one aspect of <br/>
the clues is incorrect and thus misleading us in our search.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone corroborate the precision or lack thereof of the clues?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Music Woman and I found Tea Party two weekends ago. It was <br/>
as advertised, but as I was looking in the wall, one person <br/>
stopped to tell me (I said I had "dropped something") that rats <br/>
live in there! There was a little cairn above it. When you sit there, <br/>
you do see the masts and also, there is another box VERY <br/>
NEAR. It was also interesting because as we walked to the box, I <br/>
saw my former boat (36' Uniflite) sitting there; we sold it years <br/>
ago and I was just about to tell Pam, "We used to have a boat <br/>
like that," when I realized it WAS ours. Very fun to see it. Contact <br/>
me again if you don't find the box.<br/>
