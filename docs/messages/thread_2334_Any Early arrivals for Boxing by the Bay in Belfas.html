<br/>
<br/>
Oceanwytch &amp; I were wondering if anyone attending this gathering will <br/>
be arriving before Sunday. We are staying at the Searsport campground <br/>
with some other letterboxers, and would love to meet up with anyone <br/>
attending the event early.(pre event boxing anyone?)<br/>
<br/>
We are hopefully arriving mid morning on Friday and staying through <br/>
the Sunday event.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested please feel free to email myself or oceanwytch <br/>
@ yahoo.com offline:)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks;<br/>
<br/>
