starting to receive it's first bits of spam. I've found it necessary <br/>
to start to approve new members first posts. It would just break my <br/>
heart if any pornography was to sneak thru and make it onto this <br/>
list. The change will only effect new members, and if you are reading <br/>
this now you will notice no change at all. I will do my best to <br/>
approve post's just has soon as they come in.<br/>

Thanks All!!<br/>
