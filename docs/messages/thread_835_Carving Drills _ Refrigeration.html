                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1859875383">I've been carving a stamp for the Maliseet (Malecite) Indians using both that name and their own name for themselves, Wolastoqiyik.  I've found that carving letters really helps a lot with my poor hand, to work on techniques of good, straight lines and smooth curves.<br/>
    It's very easy with, say, a tree to accept bumpitty lines as intentional, for a natural effect and say "I meant to do that!".  With letters - either gouged out or raised up - one really sees what needs working on.<br/>
    I recommend for other novices the challenge of doing words on the stamps.<br/>
    Is it true that putting the rubber into the refrigerator makes it easier to carve?  I can see that, in that the rubber has a lot of give to it.  Maybe it makes it firmer and less squishy?  How long do you keep it in?  Is a freezer just too much?  I suppose a microwave would be a bad idea.<br/>
