During spring maintenance visits to my boxes, I found a number<br/>
exposed- looking a little bit too much like trash for spring<br/>
clean-ups. Also, many of the bags were not sealed, kind of risky for<br/>
spring rains. We might all want to jog by our boxes to make sure they<br/>
are well hidden and zipped up before we are inundated with tourists.<br/>
<br/>
Think spring!<br/>

and LBNE.</div>
