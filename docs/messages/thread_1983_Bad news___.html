                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-814331778">I was wondering, why does Manny Ramirez drop so many<br/>
balls in the outfield.  He does get paid to play out<br/>
there doesn't he?  2 in one game?  Homeruns or not... <br/>
Do any of you Red Sox fans find that acceptable.  If<br/>
so, this post doesn't apply to you.  You can go back<br/>
and stare at your replica of the World Series trophy. <br/>
  Have you ever seen anyone dog plays like that in the<br/>
outfield?  Also, how is it possible that a<br/>
professional BASEBALL player has such a rag arm? <br/>
Other than batting, I don't think "Manny" would be<br/>
qualified to sell peanuts to the fools that reach into<br/>
the field of play during a game.  They're right up his<br/>
alley!!  Ahhh yes, the ever so rare combination of<br/>
ignorance and stupidity...a double threat if you will.<br/>
 He can count his homeruns and dollar bills, but will<br/>
he be able to get past 10 without having to take off<br/>
his shoes.<br/>
<br/>
I'm with you MayEve!!!  Go yanks!!!<br/>

I'll be  leaving for FL in the morning so I won't be able to attend <br/>
this weekend's gatherings. Maybe next time. I'm sure you'll all have a <br/>
great time!  Have fun- seems like you'll be adding lots of finds to <br/>
your counts!<br/>
