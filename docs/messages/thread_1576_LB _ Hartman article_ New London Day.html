Day newspaper that talks about the fairy trail up at Hartman. It <br/>
mentions letterboxing and also the web site at the end of the <br/>
article. The trail referred to has to do with Gnomlett's Series <br/>
(<a href="http://letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?</a><br/>
boxnum=9264&amp;boxname=Gnomelett's_Series).  <br/>
<br/>
You can probably check the article out on the Day's website, however <br/>
it was not online yet when I got the paper at 3:30am <br/>

much for posting on this lovely little article about Hartman Park's <br/>
Fairy Circles and their chief Gnomelett, MPf. Marianne is a lot like <br/>
our beloved letterboxer Butterfly: a delightful wonderful inspiring <br/>
bundle of positive energy who enriches our lives and reminds us that <br/>
sometimes it is the little things that matter the most.<br/>
<br/>
"Kids do terrific things and old ladies can do terrific things," <br/>
Pfeiffer said. "It's the middle group that are afraid of looking <br/>
ridiculous. Old ladies don't care anymore."<br/>
<br/>
Many blessings to our elders,<br/>
