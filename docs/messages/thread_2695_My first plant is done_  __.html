everything put together, and today, the box is planted.  YAY!  :-)   Of<br/>
course, we're expecting 8-14" of snow tomorrow, but with a little snow<br/>
digging, you should still be able to find the box.   The clue is entitled<br/>
Historical Millis #1.   The box has a different name, but I couldn't list<br/>
the name in the clue without making it TOO easy.   Currently listed on AQ,<br/>
and when LBNA is back up, it will be there too! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now....to see if I can get at least 2 others done today, possibly 3!  :-)<br/>
