like putting faces to stamps and getting to meet our community.  It <br/>
was a wonderful new center also.  Glastonbury made a good investment.  <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2017725265">Huge thanks to Wild Rover and MayEve for yet another successful Springtime Event!  It was nice to meet new letterboxers and catch up with the others.  The rain held back most of the day so a few one-time only boxes were planted on the grounds of the Riverfront Recreational Center, as well as others in the community room and on the patio.  Thanks to Music Woman, who held a carving class and MayEve, who taught Japanese Binding.  Also, thanks to all who debuted their letterboxes on that day.  Mark and Sue included all the information about the event on their website, including a map of Glastonbury and the location of the new boxes.  RTRW carved an awesome Event Stamp!    <br/>
<br/>
  I truly enjoyed the day!  Thanks, everyone!  I am happy to be part of this letterboxing community.<br/>
<br/>
  Enjoy!<br/>

Rover.  The location was fresh and new and big enough<br/>
to accommodate everyone comfortably, the in-house<br/>
boxes were lovely and creatively hidden, the food was<br/>
delicious, and the friendship of new and experienced<br/>
boxers was casual and fun. <br/>
Thanks also to Music Woman for an informative carving<br/>
demonstration and to MayEye for an easy-to-understand<br/>
logbook-making class.  <br/>
I had a wonderful time and just wanted to take this<br/>
moment to thank everyone who participated for sharing<br/>
in such a great event.<br/>

get to many gatherings and was pleased to be able to attend this one.<br/>
 Songbird and I sought out Disney Villains #7 before checking in at<br/>
the RCC, then spent the rest of the afternoon meeting old and new<br/>
friends, exchanging and seeking the one day boxes in the room. A most<br/>
enjoyable day.<br/>
