momentous milestone of 1000!!<br/>

  These past 6 days, I've met up with people, found hitchhikers and <br/>
done box repairs.  It has been glorious. I found a number of <br/>
Mansfield boxes (new and old), visited Haddam Meadows and Gillette's <br/>
Castle in E. Haddam, found Chuck and Molly ;-) in Hebron, along with <br/>
a few boxes at Holbrook pond. Visited Pomfret (Bafflin Bird Sanctuary <br/>
area) and found Teach and Preach's "We the People" l.b.  It was out <br/>
in open but is now safely hidden again. I found lots of those <br/>
wonderful NeeDeep wildlife series boxes too. Today Hurd Park in East <br/>
Hampton was on the itinerary. Found 2 hitchhikers today, 1 yesterday, <br/>
plus Lenny and Kathy were kind enough to pass one to me when we met <br/>
at Wolf Rock on Dec. 29. It was a pleasure to share the hike with <br/>
them to "In Search of Skunk Ape" and to share the honor of being the <br/>
first to stamp in. So, from no hitchhikers on Dec. 28, I now have 3, <br/>
having re-released one I found just today. I met some new people and <br/>
caught up with familiar folks and just plain got out there enjoying <br/>
the incredible weather.  Wishing you all health and happiness in 2004!<br/>
