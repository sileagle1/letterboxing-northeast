                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1277877891">I went out today and did several boxes in the area. First I searched <br/>
for Chuck and Molly's Caddy and Nessie. Both of those boxes are in <br/>
fine shape. I then did The NeeDeeps The Dating Game and Georgia State <br/>
Stamp. Those were also fine and dandy. From there I played with Teach <br/>
and Preach's Catch-Up. I looked on the wrong side of the tree at <br/>
first. Silly me, I walked right by the box! I also tried to find <br/>
Freedom Fox's Alice's Kitchen and was unsuccessful. The place was <br/>
pretty well trashed around "the block." I don't know if the box is <br/>
missing or I just did not find the log. Anyway, has anyone else tried <br/>
for this one recently? The stamps I did find were all wonderful and a <br/>
great addition to my collection! I am nearing F300 and am hoping I <br/>
will accomplish that goal soon. I also tried out my new Queen B stamp <br/>
that I carved last week. I have a new look! Well, that's it for now. <br/>
Happy hunting!<br/>
