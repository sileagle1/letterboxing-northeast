letterboxers who take mis-steps.  Now, what about the vehicles we drive <br/>
in?  Could they be awarded a purple heart?  Okay a story about my <br/>
adventures in Mansfield going after more of the monsters.  First, a <br/>
question to all....  what is the most expense that your letterboxing <br/>
adventures cost you?<br/>
<br/>
Well, after going through the Mixed Monster Series at the Lions Memorial <br/>
Park, I hopped into my Mits Eclipse.  My wife had stayed back in <br/>
Massachusetts (about 90 miles) because she had an exam in one of her <br/>
classes.  Well, as I was exiting the parking area, my front left <br/>
ball-joint broke and my front left wheel almost fell all the way off.  <br/>
WORD TO THE WISE:  AAA PLUS IS A GRAND IDEA!  Well, as it is, I only <br/>
have the basic AAA.  All in all, it didn't turn out too bad.  I called <br/>
my wife.  She luckily was done with her exam and she came down to get <br/>
me.  Well, Murphy struck again.  The auto mechanic right there in <br/>
Mansfield Center did a great job of fixing replacing my ball joint in <br/>
just under 1 1/2 hours.  Therefore, my wife drove all the way down there <br/>
for no reason.  But she did get the Attack of the Tomatoes and four of <br/>
the Doctor Who series before it got so dark (my flashlight was left in <br/>
my car which was still being fixed) that we had to bush-whack through <br/>
the woods to get to the street before we got lost.  Hopefully I can <br/>
convince the carver of that series to send me the remaining three stamps <br/>
as we did go by the stamps at warp speed to get to the street.<br/>
<br/>
Well, the damage was just over $230 for the repairs.  Not as bad as I <br/>
thought it was going to be when I hit dirt with the front of my car.<br/>
<br/>
One last thing before I bore you all to sleep:  Every person I ran into <br/>
in Mansfield, be it the tow truck driver, the people at the general <br/>
store or just the people I passed on the trails were absolutely friendly <br/>
and pleasant.  Not only is it beautiful and peaceful down there, but the <br/>
friendly people make it a place that I'd go again just for the heck of it.<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone got more of the monsters than I did,<br/>
