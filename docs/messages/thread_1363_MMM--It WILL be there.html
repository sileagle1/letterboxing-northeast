the MMM. Due to a whole host of problems, I thought that I would not <br/>
be doing it. However, it seems fate had intervened and given me a <br/>
chance to do it. As of last night I have finished the box and will <br/>
be placing it personally the day of the gather. Due to the obvious <br/>
fact that I have no idea what to write at the moment, you will have <br/>
to copy the clues down by hand from a master sheet.(sorry :(  ) Make <br/>
sure to keep your eyes open for the clues, you will not be <br/>
disappointed. See you all tomorrow!      ---Northstar</div>
