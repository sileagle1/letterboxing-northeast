logbook got mixed in with your stuff. It is a black sketch book,<br/>
8.5x5.75 inches (if I have the correct dimensions). Our names and<br/>
phone numbers are inside the front cover. Please call the 978 number<br/>
(Massachusetts).<br/>
<br/>
The log is full of stamps, including most of everything available<br/>
within the Agamenticus lodge. I had our new log out on the trail so<br/>
all the trail boxes got recorded and we at least have those stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Losing a logbook is a little like having a beloved family member<br/>
becoming a missing person. We fear for its well-being and dearly wish<br/>
to have it home, safe and sound.<br/>
<br/>
You can also send an offline email to jackmarvinATalumni.uvm.edu,<br/>
replacing AT with @, of course.<br/>
