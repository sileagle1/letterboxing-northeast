ALone for so long! What a wonderful trip:)  <br/>
I found the following in fine shape:<br/>
Lead Mountain ---&gt; last visitor was 10/03<br/>
All Things Aroostook---&gt; what a nice series<br/>
North of Ordinary<br/>
Mercury<br/>
Field's Pond<br/>
Earth<br/>
Moon<br/>
Horsefeathers<br/>
North to Freedom<br/>
Norumbega---&gt;  another hardly visited box<br/>
little blue box<br/>
James Schoolhouse<br/>
Venus<br/>
Brady Gang<br/>
Where's Waldo?<br/>
Bonnie &amp; Clyde<br/>
St.Francis (I'm not sure if this name is right.. I've lost the clue<br/>
since finding it. What I do remember is that I was first finder and it<br/>
was planted a YEAR ago!)<br/>
<br/>
unsuccessful searches:<br/>
Saturn in Maine<br/>
Eagle Lake Public Beach--I found the remnants of the box<br/>
Nordic Heritage Ski Center<br/>
coolest letterbox ever<br/>
Over the Falls--&gt; this was listed as missing but we thought we'd check<br/>
it out anyway because it's such a nice park.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There were several other boxes I had planned to get to but ran out of<br/>
time. I'll have to make another trip soon!! I also planted a box while<br/>
on my journey. If you get a chance, I recommend visiting this part of<br/>
Maine. Aroostook county is beautiful country:)<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail.......<br/>
