Sunday:<br/>
<br/>
Legendary Creatures #3: The Wendigo<br/>
Breaking Hearts at Breakheart<br/>
Legendary Creatures #1: Loch Ness Monster<br/>
Legendary Creatures #2: Nokkon Wud<br/>
Mercy Brown: Exeter Vampire<br/>
<br/>
We also attempted to find First Fallen Heroes, but we're not sure we<br/>
were even starting in the right spot, and we had no luck.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks are due to the folks who helped us out with Breaking Hearts, as<br/>
well as the folks who helped *them* out with it.<br/>
<br/>
We'd like to note that the original log for Mercy Brown is full, but<br/>
that another thoughtful boxer has put in a new one. So there are now<br/>
two logs in the box. Bob the Wiz, if you're out there, this is FYI.<br/>
<br/>
Now I'll let Rustypuff tell the story of our attempted seduction:<br/>
<br/>
Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
This is one for the books...<br/>
<br/>
I have been a Naturalist and Environmental Educator for over 15 years,<br/>
and have never had quite such an amazing wildlife interaction before<br/>
(and I've had quite a few!). This one gave me goosebumps.<br/>
<br/>
We were sitting in a magical spot, stamping in to the Nokkon Wud box.<br/>
We were just commenting on how lovely a spot it was and how it was<br/>
such a perfect spot for this monster to live. The stream trickled<br/>
gently by. Water striders battled in a pool at our feet. A tiny frog<br/>
leaped after them. There was a rustling nearby, but I think we just<br/>
assumed it was a squirrel. The rustling continued as we began to pack<br/>
up the log and stamp in their respective baggies.<br/>
<br/>
Finally we stopped to listen to the rustling as it got closer and<br/>
louder and seemed to have another, quieter noise chiming in between<br/>
the rustling. It was a peeping and cooing and chortling. Before it<br/>
really registered what it might be, we were startled by a movement<br/>
behind us. A ruffed grouse had hopped up onto a log. 'Cool!' We<br/>
thought and sat very still and watched so as to not scare it away.<br/>
<br/>
For a few minutes we thought that it was just foraging and hadn't<br/>
noticed us sitting there, even though it was only about 10 feet away,<br/>
but as we began to get cramped up from sitting frozen still and had to<br/>
move our legs and necks we realized that it not only knew we were<br/>
there, but was checking us out. It didn't care that we moved or spoke<br/>
to each other or even snapped the lid of the box back on.<br/>
<br/>
At first I thought it was a female trying to draw our attention away<br/>
from youngsters nearby, but since there was no 'mock' broken wing or<br/>
body dragging behavior and it is really rather late in the season for<br/>
baby grouse, I figured it was a male and that we had happened to sit<br/>
right next to his lekking log (grouse, like turkey, stake out a<br/>
prominent piece of real estate - called a lek - on which to display<br/>
for females. Grouse drum their chests a la Tarzan in the mating season).<br/>
<br/>
Back and forth he wandered, coming ever closer and making cooing and<br/>
chucking noises. We realized that we didn't have any need of sitting<br/>
still or being quiet. This little one was not only not concerned, he<br/>
was displaying for us. I just thought this was so very cool and so<br/>
very strange.<br/>
<br/>
The little grouse would stop and cock his head at us, coo, ruffle his<br/>
tail and his neck ruff and pick up a leaf and turn around and toss the<br/>
leaf so that it would slide down his back. Leaf after leaf, he would<br/>
slide them down his back. He came closer and closer.<br/>
<br/>
It got to the point that he was only about a foot away. I wouldn't<br/>
have been surprised if he had hopped into CSCM's lap. CSCM picked up a<br/>
leaf in response to him and tossed it gently into the air. This seemed<br/>
to elicit more cooing and chortling, so he tossed another leaf. Back<br/>
and forth they took turns tossing leaves. CSCM reached out his hand<br/>
toward the grouse... and got bitten, which I could have told him would<br/>
happen. So he returned to tossing leaves. The grouse was very enamored<br/>
with us.<br/>
<br/>
This went on for about 20 minutes or so. We finally decided that we<br/>
had to get going. The afternoon was wearing on, and we had other plans<br/>
for 'boxing that day. We got up, replaced the box, said 'goodbye' to<br/>
the grouse and began heading back down the trail. We had only gone a<br/>
short way when we heard a frantic chuttering behind us. We turned<br/>
around to see the grouse running down the trail after us. When we<br/>
stopped, he caught up with us and resumed his little show. We talked<br/>
with him a bit more, assuring him that we really wouldn't be a good<br/>
match and apologized to him for having to leave. We felt bad as we<br/>
walked down the trail and a bit concerned that he might try the same<br/>
thing with a predator. He followed us a short way down the trail, but<br/>
eventually must have hit the distant edge of his territory and watched<br/>
us leave.<br/>
<br/>
We had a great rest of the day, but couldn't help feeling like we had<br/>
just left our true love at the train station.<br/>

I do hope that your combined attraction to beasts and feathered friends will continue while we are in Dartmoor together! I will be close by your sides, hoping so!<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!! <br/>
