and all others who made the Laudholm gathering such a fun and <br/>
informative time! The box stamps were of super quality and it is <br/>
always great to see all the familiar faces again! <br/>
<br/>
Despite Binx having this awful cold that seemed to have hit a few <br/>
other boxers as well (how you doing Jeremy and Brian?), we had a <br/>
great northbound trip, stopping in Kittery for a couple boxes before <br/>
arriving too late to the State of Maine to greet our fellow southern <br/>
New Englanders. We proceeded on a wild goose chase for a couple of <br/>
mystery boxes before giving up and going to "see the lights" in the <br/>
area south of Portland. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Federal Jack's was a blast...it's fun to see people from such <br/>
diverse backgrounds meeting a table for dinner, all in the name of <br/>
our outdoor explorations. Great to see you all again and to meet a <br/>
few new faces (welcome Roamin Warrior and Peace Amy from RI!).<br/>
<br/>
Despite the slushy conditions due to an overnight snow-then-rain <br/>
storm, we accompanied TeamGreenDragon, RustyPuff/CSCM, Roamin <br/>
Warrior and Peace Amy on a nice trek across the heath of Saco. <br/>
Thanks for the great boxes Phyto &amp; Isosceles! <br/>
<br/>
We then hot-footed it back south to Wells in time to catch the <br/>
Dartmoor presentation by Debbie. Very interesting and I am now <br/>
intrigued with the idea of getting to Dartmoor at some point! <br/>
Despite some technical difficulties, it was great to hear the scoop <br/>
from someone who got to letterbox as an educational sabbatical...how <br/>
cool is that? The tick info was handy (thanks Culex), and we can't <br/>
wait to create felt pouches for our sig stamps to replace the wads <br/>
of dirty paper towels we usually use. I somehow missed the matchbook <br/>
demo entirely, much to my dismay (hah! I've always wanted to use <br/>
that phrase!).<br/>
<br/>
Laudholm Farm felt like a mini-Connecticut and we boxed our hearts <br/>
out well into the afternoon, being the very last car in the parking <br/>
lot when we finally bugged out at 5:30. Excellent carvings and great <br/>
clues, all! Laudholm Farm itself is a beautiful place and we look <br/>
forward to another visit this spring simply to walk around and enjoy <br/>
it all.<br/>
<br/>
See you next time round!<br/>

the after-gathering dinner. <br/>
<br/>
We had a great time this last weekend and I want to thank everyone <br/>
involved. <br/>
<br/>
Laura, when we got home I looked at the Audubon book again, and there <br/>
was a picture of a saw-whet owl. Could these little guys be any <br/>
cuter? Looks like something Disney would dream up. I've since found a <br/>
wonderful image on-line and will be happily carving away over the <br/>
next couple weeks. I'll be in touch when it's done and make <br/>
arrangements to get it to you.<br/>
<br/>
Again, Thanks to all for a great weekend in Maine!<br/>

</span></blockquote>Glad you enjoyed yourselves- it was nice to see you again, and thanks <br/>
for the compliments on the stamps :)<br/>
You didn't actually miss the matchbook-style logbook demo. I never ended <br/>
up doing it because just as I was starting, the darn fire alarm went off <br/>
'cuz someone pulled it (I don't think it was anyone at the letterboxing <br/>
gathering) and I had to go deal with the *&amp;%$!@#!! company who only has <br/>
an answering service on weekends and to wait for a technician to call me <br/>
back so we could get it turned off. I didn't get back to the gathering <br/>
until the time of the group photo and after that everyone was busy with <br/>
lunch and no one seemed interested.<br/>
Maybe next time... If I could draw I'd maybe write up instructions and <br/>
post them, but it's so much simpler just to see it done. If you come up <br/>
this way again anytime soon I'd be glad to show you!<br/>
