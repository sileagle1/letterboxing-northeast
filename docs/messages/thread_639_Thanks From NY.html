kept us all in under shelter yakking away and eating!!  (of course <br/>
stamping and exchanging was going on).  The raffle was a big hit as <br/>
something new at a gathering (new to me anyhow) So thank you for <br/>
that. (Someday I'll wish I hadn't turned down that stick).  :0] <br/>
<br/>
In the end I headed for NY begrudgingly, stopping to say good-bye to <br/>
Music Woman who was stamping in on a box. Then stopping to check in <br/>
on the outhouse.<br/>
<br/>
I was all set to head toward Rte 44 when about a qtr mile down the <br/>
road, I had a thought. Turning around I went and stamped in at The <br/>
Yowie! My little toyota isn't a truck but it made the voyage there <br/>
and back again!  Thanks Chuck&amp; Molly &amp; Chic-a-birdie; and of course <br/>
all the planners and planters, and cooks too!!!<br/>
<br/>
Take care out there!!<br/>
