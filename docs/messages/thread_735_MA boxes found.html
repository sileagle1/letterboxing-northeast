                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-574130377">Went out to Gloucester/Rockport today to do some boxing...found:<br/>
~ The Bull Frog Pond in less than pristine condition. The top of the <br/>
container is gone and things were a bit soggy, so its sitting in my <br/>
car right now waiting for a new container.<br/>
<br/>
~ Young's Great Rock/Wigwam Point Light is in great condition and the <br/>
location is lovely. Just be careful of the stickers around the rock!<br/>
<br/>
~ Castle of Love looks to be gone as there is a "Drill Here" stick <br/>
where I think the box would probably be. Either way, the property is <br/>
being built on so its probably not there<br/>
<br/>
~ Eastern Point Lighthouse...we got distracted by a large crab that <br/>
needed to go back into the water, snail shells, and sea glass. I <br/>
believe we were in the right spot, but probably not. Either way, it <br/>
was a nice spot to do some beach combing :)<br/>

April, the last time we checked on it. I'll make a<br/>
point of going out there this week to check on it<br/>
again.<br/>
