decided to pick up a few "easy" boxes along the way.  We got 4 -- <br/>
the three in Deering and the one at the Franklin Pierce Homestead.  <br/>
All were in great shape.<br/>
<br/>
A funny story happened at the Deering Library.  I'll tell you about <br/>
it as part of my write-up on our website.  The write-ups should be <br/>
avialable by tomorrow.<br/>

P.S. Although we delay our first plants, they will happen soon -- we <br/>
promise!!</div>

i had to laugh when i saw your write up on the deering library. living in<br/>
hillsboro i am familiar with the library and the police station next door.<br/>
isn't it funny to think of getting a letterbox right in plain view of the<br/>
local law enforcement? <br/>
i also could not help but notice that you did not go to henniker, which is<br/>
right next door also. and just happens to have my first carved and planted<br/>
stamp in it.... but then again after seeing pennypenny first stamp i don't<br/>
think i will claim it!<br/>

librarian that made us laugh and wonder most.  A charming little <br/>
library!<br/>
<br/>
The weekend we found this letterbox wasn't about letterboxing ... we <br/>
often travel to visit other things and try to pick up a couple of <br/>
letterboxes in the process.  We ruled out any boxes that weren't in <br/>
our direct path or that required hiking.  We'll be headed back up to <br/>
NH for the Labor Day weekend, but again, the focus isn't <br/>
letterboxing ('though it will be hard not to search for at least a <br/>
few of them while were there).<br/>
<br/>
The Henniker box is close enough -- we'll get it someday!<br/>
