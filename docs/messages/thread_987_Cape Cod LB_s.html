I figured if I gave them some easy ones that we had just found then they might stick with it.  Believe it or not we never got their names!  We did give them our email and asked them to let us know if they found any.<br/>
<br/>
We were sure that we were in the right place for the Yurt also.  There were four of us looking and I think we covered a large area and no luck.  <br/>
<br/>
When we looked for the Kayaker we originally took the wrong path.  When we found it on the right path it was lying out in the open so we had to rehide it.  Maybe someone messed with it again!  It was there on the 11th.<br/>
