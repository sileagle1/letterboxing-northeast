sort-of event stamp, I had some extra time on my hands and carved a <br/>
little something of my own. I'll be bringing it tomorrow for the <br/>
attendees of the mini. After the event, the image will be slightly <br/>
altered and the color of the ink will also be changed so it can be <br/>
turned into a box for others to find. Only the people who attend the <br/>
mini will get the original image though. Hope to see lots of new <br/>
faces and lots of old ones too!     --Northstar</div>
