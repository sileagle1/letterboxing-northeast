While doing a box check we were forced to bushwhack several hundred yards because of giant puddles on the trail and then the trail itself became a small brook. I hated doing this because the original set of clues were so much fun.<br/>
It's closer and much easier to find in the new location. Thanks to all who have found it especially the brave ones last fall.<br/>
