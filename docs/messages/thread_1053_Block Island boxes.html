<br/>
Just returned from a great 2 week vacation on Block Island!  Found 5 boxes plus a HitchHiker while we were there.<br/>
<br/>
Kayak Club-nice short hike, found "Ride for Frosty" HH inside!!! First HH for us!<br/>
<br/>
Clayhead Trail-again, nice and easy.  This one was placed by the Gal Pals, and the clues said it was an add on to the Block Island vacation box.  Couldn't find the clues for that one, so I e-mailed them.  Ended up talking with all three of them, one by e-mail, the other 2 on the phone as they were on Block Island too.  All 3 of them are so nice!  They directed me to their website www.thither.org and found that the Block Island letterbox was missing but that they had 2 other boxes on the island that are not on the LBNA site:<br/>
Happy Birthday-a little longer hike, nice views.<br/>
Preserving the Dickens-a mystery box that we found the correct spot, but had to report it missing to them<br/>
<br/>
Treasure Chest-long, beautiful walk to the North Point of the Island.  Saw a mother seagull feeding her babies, and a whale that had been washed up on shore (quite awhile ago by the looks of it)  Kids enjoyed getting a piece of treasure from the box.<br/>
<br/>
Captain Kidd-another long and beautiful walk.  The kids found some more treasure here too!<br/>
<br/>
All of the boxes were in very good condition.  I added a few ziploc bags here and there to tidy things up.  (thanks to reading all of the posts about ziploc bags)<br/>
<br/>
I've only been letterboxing for about a month.  This was a great experience for me on Block Island.  I've been going to Block Island since I was 7 or 8 years old, and now I bring my 4 children to visit every year.  I saw parts of the island this year that I'd never seen before thanks to my new obsession.  The cottage we stay in has this "useless" room with lots of old books and magazines in it.  Well imagine my excitement when the Smithsonian April 1998 magazine was there!  I was able to read all about the Dartmoor letterboxing!  Very cool!  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows of any other BI letterboxes, let me know.  We'll be back again in the fall or spring.  Happy Boxing!<br/>
