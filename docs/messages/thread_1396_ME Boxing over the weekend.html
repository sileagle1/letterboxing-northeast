highlight was The Art Guru in Groham, ME. Trust me! Go there! Get <br/>
that box... it's a gorgeous stamp and Merenwen and Olwe are just the <br/>
nicest people in the world. The entire box is beautiful.... wish I'd <br/>
had time to get some of the other boxes in Portland and Gorham but <br/>
had a cranky 9 year old who just wanted to get to Gramma's.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I stopped and checked on Crazy Heart and it is indeed mssing. I <br/>
will try to replace it soon.<br/>
<br/>
I also managed to take a quick pit stop at the Wells Transportation <br/>
Hitchhiker Hostel finally. <br/>
<br/>
That's it. Sorry I missed Monster Mash.<br/>
