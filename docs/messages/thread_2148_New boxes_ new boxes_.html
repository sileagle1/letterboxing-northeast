<a href="http://home.comcast.net/~scott.e.hall/clues/Willard_Clock.html)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://home.comcast.net/~scott.e.hall/clues/Willard_Clock.html)</a>, it's<br/>
time to plant another!<br/>
<br/>
I've long wanted to plant a box on the Boston Harbor Islands (there is<br/>
one box there currently, but you need a boat to get to it), but have<br/>
waiting pending some research into whether the NPS manages the islands.<br/>
<br/>
They do not.  They are part of the 13-member partnership made up of<br/>
various local, state, and federal agencies that individiually own all<br/>
of the Boston Harbor Islands and collectively manage them.  The NPS<br/>
does not own any of them.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, although it is not perfectly clear whether the NPS' restriction<br/>
on letterboxes would apply to a park they do not own and only<br/>
co-manage under a unique set of by-laws, it is my assertion that it<br/>
does not.<br/>
<br/>
So, on to the details.<br/>
<br/>
Scarab (of the Doubtful Guests) has graciously offered to carve the<br/>
stamp for this box.  Titled "The Lady in Black" the letterbox honors<br/>
the legend of the ghost that wanders the island and it's principal<br/>
building, Fort Warren.  If you're curious, read more at<br/>

Scarab!<br/>
<br/>
This box will be placed on Georges Island when I travel there as part<br/>
of a business outing August 26.   Stay tuned!<br/>
