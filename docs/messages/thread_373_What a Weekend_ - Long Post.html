Yup - that's right - we spent a day in CT (heh, heh, heh)<br/>
<br/>
We drove 2 and half hours on Saturday to Redding, Ct.<br/>
Our objective was to meet Alan and his hiking class at<br/>
Hungtington State Park at noon. We arrived about 10:30 <br/>
and went to Putnam Park and found 3 of Alan's boxes. <br/>
This was a wonderful park steeped in history of Revolutionary <br/>
Soldiers. As we approached the location for the third box,<br/>
we saw a small group of people walking down the hill. Of course,<br/>
it was Alan and his hiking class (we were not surprised but we <br/>
were very psyched to see our old friend again!) After a quick trip<br/>
to snag another box in a different location at Putnam park (What <br/>
was the name of that box, Alan, the one with the Apple stamp in it)<br/>
We drove over to Huntington State park and ate our lunch while our<br/>
hands were so cold we couldn't even feel them. Eventually, we were <br/>
joined by the Columbian Bugs and headed out for our long trek through<br/>
the woods to find the Peanuts gang. After a while, we "bumped into"<br/>
Just Beth, who found us "discretely" stamping into one of the <br/>
Huntington State Park boxes and along came Phynstar with Northstar.<br/>
All of us plugged along, climbing hills and sometimes huffing and <br/>
puffing - cold hands, and shortage of water. We had a lot of laughs, <br/>
while Alan stood scratching his head (I won't go into that) but it <br/>
was funny! I think that at least two of Alan's students, Debbie and <br/>
Dennis, will join our ranks as "official letterboxers".  By 6 pm, <br/>
with the sun setting and my hands as numb as my brain, our total <br/>
count for the day was 16 finds. Huntington State Park is a beautiful<br/>
parcel of land with lots of glacial erratics and old foundations.<br/>
Many wonderful features with lots of boxing potential. I'm glad we <br/>
made the trip out there finally. Thanks Alan! It took us five hours <br/>
to get home while we sat in a traffic jam on I-95 in Providence due <br/>
to a five car accident. <br/>
<br/>
On Sunday, we took it easy by strolling along Mt Hope Farm in <br/>
Bristol, RI. Beautiful place, where we met Quin the famous greyhound.<br/>
(you have to find the first letterbox of the series to know why Quin <br/>
is famous). The boxes are hidden in wonderful locations with special <br/>
qualities. Then, after realizing that there is no place to eat on <br/>
Route 1 near Foxboro Stadium - we found a Happy Turtle who is indeed <br/>
very happy and in good condition. Then we climbed a hill to find out <br/>
that Jay and Amy are very much in love and that their box is well <br/>
taken care of! <br/>
