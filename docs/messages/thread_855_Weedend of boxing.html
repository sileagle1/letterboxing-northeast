for Paul and Ringo in Essex but things got better after that.  Had a<br/>
nice hike finding the XYZ boxes in Deep River.  On Sunday, we made<br/>
two successful Quests - one in VT and another in NH.  Today we picked<br/>
up 3 of the Covered Bridge series in NH, 5 more boxes in Henniker and<br/>
Hillsborough plus the Irish Rover Hitchhiker.  Included in this list<br/>
were 3 first finds!  Also planted a few boxes in CT and in NH which<br/>
will be showing up in the What's New list soon.   <br/>
