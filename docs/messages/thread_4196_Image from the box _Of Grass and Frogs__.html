<br/>
I'm Martha, and I'm moving back to New England after 14 years in Wisconsin.  It's good to be home!<br/>
<br/>
I went letterboxing today near my parents house in Westford, MA at Grassy Pond park, and found the box "Of Grass and Frogs" swamped and the stamp had been "geocached" (i.e., it's gone).<br/>
<br/>
link:  <a href="http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=7550" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=7550</a><br/>
<br/>
This box was marked as Adoptable, so I adopted it -- a box that's been active since 2004 needs to keep going! --  but I'd love to find an image of the original stamp image, and re-carve it for this box.  And then re-plant it away from the geocache!  :)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone here has this stamp image in one of their logbooks, could you take a picture of it and e-mail it to me so I can re-carve the original image?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for any help or advice.<br/>
<br/>
