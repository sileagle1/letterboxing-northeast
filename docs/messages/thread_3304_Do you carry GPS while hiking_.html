  The series is called a Colonial Stroll.  I'm not sure if it is still in place. You may want to contact the placer to see if they have been pulled or not.  f.y.i.: Wickford boxes may be listed under North Kingstown.  <br/>

&gt; You can find the clues to these boxes on the LBNA site.  Look in <br/>
the <br/>

&gt; &gt; Last weekend I was looking at boxes and I remember seeing a box <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; Wickford<br/>
&gt; &gt; RI that said it had been placed for a special gathering (actually <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; think it<br/>
&gt; &gt; was 3 boxes) and they would be in place until January.  Now I <br/>
&gt; cannot find<br/>
&gt; &gt; this listing.... I have searched using google, and both lb.org <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; AQ.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Can someone point me to the right place?<br/>

  Diane, I am sorry you spent time looking for a series that has already<br/>
  been pulled! When I asked about it a few weeks ago, I then contacted<br/>
  the placer and she told me it had been pulled and she would remove the<br/>
  listing from the websites...I guess she hadn't done that yet.<br/>
