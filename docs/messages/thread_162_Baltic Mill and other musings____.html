Butterfly and hear all about her wonderful trip to Utah!  I also got to partake in <br/>
some goodies brought back from Utah, and her wonderful veg. soup!  <br/>
YUMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!  I also found a couple of mystery boxes that I had been missing, planted <br/>
one (I hope they allow it!  I have a note in to the manager!  Its an indoor <br/>
box, which I have a feeling that we will need a lot of this year!), and helped <br/>
Bluebird plant four others!  <br/>
<br/>
On Sunday, Bluebird and I ventured out to the Baltic Mill (it was still too <br/>
cold for Butterfly... but we hope that she'll come with us soon!), and we still <br/>
couldn't find the box, since the GPS coordinates given on the informational <br/>
site that we used to find W 9 were somewhat off!  We gave up the search and <br/>
found Salt Rock, Spignesi WMA, Steve's Birthday box, and In the Line of Duty all <br/>
in good order.  We then decided to head towards home, but found Lions, Tigers <br/>
and Bear, Life's Lessons #1, Cats and Dogs, and Tell Tale Apples all in good <br/>
order.<br/>
<br/>
I got SO frustrated over Baltic Mill that I decided to get more information <br/>
from that informational site and am glad to report that it worked!  Today after <br/>
school, I ventured out and found the Baltic Mill LB and I Love Lucy!  Woo <br/>
Hoo!  Now, if there HADN'T been any snow, I would have tried for Compass Rose <br/>
again, but with the three inches of snow, I don't think I would have seen any <br/>
flat rocks...!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the great boxes everyone!<br/>
