Sadie and Russ said you called them on one of the<br/>
boxes that we had found.  Were you able to get that<br/>
one ??<br/>
I have a question .  Of all the boxed in this series ,<br/>
 that you have found so far,  are any of the stamps<br/>
hand carved ??  I have enjoyed reading the clues and<br/>
trying to follow along with my maps,  only having<br/>
found a few of the actual boxes  as I do not box alone<br/>
and it is hard to get anyone else interested. <br/>

<br/>
No, despite Russ' help, we were unable to find the box.  It was a<br/>
needle in a haystack search and after a very long time at it, we<br/>
finally conceded.<br/>
<br/>
The stamps are not hand-carved.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the challenges, this seems to be an excellent series, albeit a<br/>
frustrating one.   It's tough, takes some fair knowledge of the trails<br/>
in Ashford, and a bit of imagination.  All the things that make<br/>
finding the boxes (once you) all that much more worthwhile.<br/>
<br/>
But don't expect to get them all in one day!<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

Wilson Mountain (btw, since when is 250' a mountain?! <br/>

been found recently so I know it's there. I'm fairly <br/>
certain from the clues that I'm in the right place. It's <br/>
such a nice area that I don't mind the trips back. :o)<br/>
