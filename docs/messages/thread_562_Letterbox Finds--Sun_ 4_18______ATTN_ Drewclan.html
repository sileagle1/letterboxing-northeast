stragglers. I'm sorry to report that the "Right Hip" box is most <br/>
likely missing.(I searched for a while) "Ned's Cabin" is alive and <br/>
well in it's home. Up on the Left Leg, I couldn't seem to make the <br/>
clues work for the box and missed out. Ditto for "Quartz Rock". I <br/>
think the rock with the pipe in it is gone! However, I can't be <br/>
absolutely sure of anything until I go with someone who's already <br/>
found the boxes and can confirm. After that, my luck took a turn for <br/>
the better when I picked up "Bluebird's Welcome", "The Necklace" <br/>
and "The Purple Flower"(around the head#2) All of those boxes were in <br/>
good condition. Better luck next time, I guess. Thanks for the <br/>
memories!!   --Northstar     P.S.--I know, I know, only one more <br/>
report to go,then I'll stop!</div>
