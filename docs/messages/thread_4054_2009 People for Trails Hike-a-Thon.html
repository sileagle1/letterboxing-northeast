<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With the rapid rate of development in the northeast, each year many miles of<br/>
trails are lost.  Along with the loss of outdoor recreation also is the loss<br/>
of acres of trees and wildlife habitat.  Organizations like the New York/New<br/>
Jersey Trail Conference and the Open Space Institute work very hard to<br/>
create new outdoor spaces and campaigns to increase community awareness.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On Saturday 3 October 2009, my friend Elizabeth (of Rabbit's Friends and<br/>
Relations) and I will be participating in the 2nd Annual People for Trails<br/>
Hike-a-thon at Bear Mountain State Park.  Funds raised will help with trail<br/>
maintenance and the creation of a new Trails for People interpretive exhibit<br/>
at the Harriman-Bear Mountain State Park.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We were going to go for the strenuous hike of 9 miles, but remembered back<br/>
to last June when we hiked 5 miles in preparation for the Summer is HERE!<br/>
Gather and realized we weren't twenty-something anymore and opted for the<br/>
moderate  4 mile hike.  We would like to suggest a $5 per mile pledge.  My<br/>
personal goal for this year's Hike-a-thon is $500.  Anything you can do (big<br/>
or small) to help me reach that goal is greatly appreciated.  If your place<br/>
of business would like to sponsor us, let me know!  Keep your pledge<br/>
receipts as your donation is tax deductible.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Starting today, I'll have a pledge PT with me at all times. make a pledge<br/>
and no matter where we meet, on or off the trail it's yours! And of course a<br/>
box or two will be planted along the way!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your support!!!<br/>
