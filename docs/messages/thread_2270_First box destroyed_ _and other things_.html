I am finally dealing with the loss of a letterbox.  Mary's Lamb, my<br/>
great little mystery box and one of the two first boxes planted by me<br/>
and my former GF, has been destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
Well, maybe not.  It may still exist buried under the pile of<br/>
construction debris and rubble that used to be it's hiding place. <br/>
Actually, I like to think this is the case -- and than a hundred plus<br/>
years from now someone will excavate the site and discover the little<br/>
letterbox -- a time capsule of our hobby!<br/>
<br/>
The box will be replaced, but no time line has been set.<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
<br/>
On more positive news, two boxes previously announced have now been<br/>
planted!!  "Walden", with a great stamp carved by Jacks, has been<br/>
placed at Walden Pond State Reservation in Concord, MA, and "I Can't<br/>
Carve", the letterbox dedicated to letterboxers who love the hobby but<br/>
have no carving ability whatsoever, has been placed in Cochituate<br/>
State Park in Natick, MA.  Clues are now available on my website,<br/>
accessible at <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~scott.e.hall/letterbox.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://home.comcast.net/~scott.e.hall/letterbox.html</a> or<br/>
via the links on the LbNA database or AQ.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, to promote more visitors, I've unmasked the mystery that<br/>
was my very first box, Red Horse.  Up until now it's location has been<br/>
a mystery (although an easy one to solve).  As much as I like mystery<br/>
boxes and puzzles, it seems as though many letterboxers pass over<br/>
these boxes in lieu of the straight-forward clues leaving the mystery<br/>
box to be rarely visited.<br/>
<br/>
When Mary's Lamb is replaced it will remain a mystery box, but Red<br/>
Horse is no longer.  I have recategorized it on LbNA and AQ and listed<br/>
it's location within the box's clues.<br/>
<br/>
That's my update for now!  In four weeks The Lady in Black will be<br/>
placed and I'm also working on my very first series!<br/>
<br/>
And, of course, looking forward to Moose Hill Mach 3 coming up later<br/>
this month!<br/>
