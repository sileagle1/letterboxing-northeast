<br/>
My boyfriend and I have been boxing since the beggining of this <br/>
year. As I'm sure all of you already know.. its a addicting, and we <br/>
love it. We hail from South Jersey &amp; Long Island, but are currently <br/>
in our fourth (and final) year at the University of New Haven in CT. <br/>
<br/>
We are going on Sunday to find 12 CT State Forest boxes (we want <br/>
those free walking sticks they are promising to those who find all <br/>
thirty) and we plan on picking up some more individuals boxes while <br/>
we are up there (since individuals' boxes are probably more fun). If <br/>
anyone has a box in Litchfield County, CT let us know and we will <br/>
make it priority!<br/>
<br/>
Hate to post this on the LB North America group and this one.. but <br/>
does anyone know of a LB (or a series) on a trail that runs along <br/>
Old Marsh Pond in Bristol, CT? It was the first box David &amp; I ever <br/>
found, and what got the idea in our heads to begin with (3 years <br/>
ago! .. sometimes it takes a while to get started). We can't find <br/>
clues anywhere online to a box over there.. and if any one knows it <br/>
would mean a lot to a young sentimental couple!<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to introduce ourselves since our *HappilyEverAfter* <br/>
stamp will soon be appearing in LBs everywhere! :) <br/>
<br/>
We love our new sport!<br/>

No question is a stupid question. remember that. so, you being new boxers, there is a series of boxes in east hampton, ct called "the easter egg hunt series" that i would suggest you get soon. the boxes will retire at the end of this month. even though the individuals are more fun and sometimes a series is better, i find that the boxes that will retire, are the boxes that only so many will have. i love those boxes! kinda like a rare baseball card. gotta have it. well i should let you go, i have some box planning to do. come up to my neck of the woods sometime. i'll show you 2 my<br/>

will be able to track down this box, and the first box we found <br/>
(wouldn't that be a feat) David claims to have photogenic memory and <br/>
he thinks he knows where the box we found roughly 3 yrs ago is (insert <br/>
a big ha ha yea right from Sara). WE will see if memory serves him. I <br/>
think we are definitly going to take the advice at the end of these <br/>
clues to do the Tunxis Trail .. Miles of Ledges has been tempting me <br/>
since we have started our new sport. Thanks for the help!<br/>

Two active Ct. boxers are headed to New Hampshire the<br/>
week of April 21-28 and will be staying in the<br/>
Franconia area.  Is that anywhere close to you ,or any<br/>
other boxers?.  We would love to meet and exchange and<br/>
possible box with new'friends' <br/>

&gt; Welcome, welcome, welcome. to some i am still farely new(depends <br/>
on what comes out of my mouth!) to others i've been here some long <br/>
enough. i come from the great state of new hampshire and visit <br/>
connecticut on a regular basis. relatives. i need something to <br/>
atleast make me what to com see them and boxing has done that for <br/>
me. Team New Hampshire consists of 5 of us and we all are addicted <br/>
as you are. No question is a stupid question. remember that. so, you <br/>
being new boxers, there is a series of boxes in east hampton, ct <br/>
called "the easter egg hunt series" that i would suggest you get <br/>
soon. the boxes will retire at the end of this month. even though <br/>
the individuals are more fun and sometimes a series is better, i <br/>
find that the boxes that will retire, are the boxes that only so <br/>
many will have. i love those boxes! kinda like a rare baseball card. <br/>
gotta have it. well i should let you go, i have some box planning to <br/>
do. come up to my neck of the woods sometime. i'll show you 2 my<br/>
&gt;  state. the granite state. happy boxing.<br/>

&gt; those who find all <br/>
&gt; thirty) and we plan on picking up some more<br/>

&gt; we are up there (since individuals' boxes are<br/>

&gt; We can't find <br/>

Franconia area.  Is that anywhere close to you ,or any<br/>
other boxers?.  We would love to meet and exchange and<br/>
possible box with new'friends' <br/>

&gt; consists of 5 of us and we all are addicted as you<br/>
&gt; are. No question is a stupid question. remember<br/>
&gt; that. so, you being new boxers, there is a series of<br/>
&gt; boxes in east hampton, ct called "the easter egg<br/>
&gt; hunt series" that i would suggest you get soon. the<br/>
&gt; boxes will retire at the end of this month. even<br/>
&gt; though the individuals are more fun and sometimes a<br/>
&gt; series is better, i find that the boxes that will<br/>
&gt; retire, are the boxes that only so many will have. i<br/>
&gt; love those boxes! kinda like a rare baseball card.<br/>
&gt; gotta have it. well i should let you go, i have some<br/>
&gt; box planning to do. come up to my neck of the woods<br/>

&gt;   Hello Everyone!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My boyfriend and I have been boxing since the<br/>
&gt; beggining of this <br/>
&gt; year. As I'm sure all of you already know.. its a<br/>
&gt; addicting, and we <br/>
&gt; love it. We hail from South Jersey &amp; Long Island,<br/>
&gt; but are currently <br/>
&gt; in our fourth (and final) year at the University of<br/>
&gt; New Haven in CT. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are going on Sunday to find 12 CT State Forest<br/>
&gt; boxes (we want <br/>
&gt; those free walking sticks they are promising to<br/>
&gt; those who find all <br/>
&gt; thirty) and we plan on picking up some more<br/>
&gt; individuals boxes while <br/>
&gt; we are up there (since individuals' boxes are<br/>
&gt; probably more fun). If <br/>
&gt; anyone has a box in Litchfield County, CT let us<br/>
&gt; know and we will <br/>
&gt; make it priority!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hate to post this on the LB North America group and<br/>
&gt; this one.. but <br/>
&gt; does anyone know of a LB (or a series) on a trail<br/>
&gt; that runs along <br/>
&gt; Old Marsh Pond in Bristol, CT? It was the first box<br/>
&gt; David &amp; I ever <br/>
&gt; found, and what got the idea in our heads to begin<br/>
&gt; with (3 years <br/>
&gt; ago! .. sometimes it takes a while to get started).<br/>
&gt; We can't find <br/>
&gt; clues anywhere online to a box over there.. and if<br/>
&gt; any one knows it <br/>
&gt; would mean a lot to a young sentimental couple!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just wanted to introduce ourselves since our<br/>
&gt; *HappilyEverAfter* <br/>
&gt; stamp will soon be appearing in LBs everywhere! :) <br/>
