<br/>
We went to Barkhamsted, CT yesterday and visited American Legion &amp; <br/>
People's State forests. This is a must box for anyone boxing in CT. <br/>
There were tons of boxes.. we were there for a few hours and picked <br/>
up 11 stamps! Thank you to Music Woman, The Engraver, and los <br/>
banditos for some really fun (and challenging) hikes! We must say <br/>
Nature of the Forest Parts 1 &amp; 2 are fun to do with a partner <br/>
because both follow the same path.. and each person can be in charge <br/>
of their own "part". <br/>
<br/>
We think we heard a moose or a bear, but we weren't going to stick <br/>
around to see what was making the loud growling/howling noise. Has <br/>
anyone seen moose or bear in Northern CT? The DEP LB's clues mention <br/>
that both live in the area. <br/>
<br/>
Some of the boxes (especially one placed by the Engraver) were <br/>
damaged or out of place.. I have notified those placers, and tried <br/>
to stick the box we found out of place back where we think it was <br/>
supposed to be. I know that a lot of LBs carry replacement log <br/>
books, but what do you do with an old wet one? (I just put it in a <br/>
new baggie to keep it from further damage) Should we have taken it, <br/>
tried to dry it out, and send it to the placer? I felt so bad <br/>
leaving it there.. but I didn't want to risk angering the placer by <br/>
taking it. <br/>
