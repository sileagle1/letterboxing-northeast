<br/>
I've finally decided to invest in a better box.  The gladware just ain't<br/>
holdin' up like it use-ta.  Does anyone know where to get the tried and<br/>
true Douggerware in the NY, CT area.  I've hit every $ store from Port<br/>
Jervis to Pawling and can't find the stuff.  I've seen stuff similar,<br/>
but alas, no Milan Classic.<br/>
<br/>
TT<br/>

   I think it was on this message board, awhile back, that someone was looking for the <br/>
douggerware containers. After braving the pouring rain to go food shopping, I was thrilled <br/>
when I saw them on the shelves at Market Basket. They were the 4 cup ones with the green <br/>
lids. If I can't get out there and box then I can at least buy boxes!!<br/>
  Let's hope the sun shines soon so we can get back on the trails.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion</div>

I can't believe that you guys were out in that monson rainstorm. Where did you go and <br/>
what boxes did you get? <br/>
<br/>
I finally got the YEAT box in Newburyport. It only took 3 times!!! Kelley definitely has the <br/>
LB eyes in our house.<br/>
<br/>
See you at Fright Night next week. I hope it doesn't rain!!!!<br/>
