my post.  I tried to be very careful in how I worded my comment so <br/>
that it wouldn't create the very problem that it did.  The post was <br/>
not intended as an attack against you, but more a reminder to everyone <br/>
of the delicate situation of loons nesting right now.  Your photos <br/>
were great and I think you should put them back on the site and let <br/>
everyone know how you got them (type of lens, etc.)  This would help <br/>
people to realize the appropriate way to capture wildlife shots.  <br/>
Again, my sincerest apologies.  I truly try not to ruffle feathers <br/>
here and I guess my concern for the loon chicks meant I wasn't as <br/>
careful with my words as I should have been.<br/>
