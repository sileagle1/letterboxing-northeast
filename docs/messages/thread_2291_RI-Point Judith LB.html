<br/>
This is the Point Judith, RI, Letterbox speaking.<br/>
<br/>
Numerous rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated.  My <br/>
adopted parent, Warrior Woman, received 7 (seven!) private emails <br/>
from different seekers via the "contact the placer" feature within <br/>
the last two months indicating that the letterbox is gone.<br/>
<br/>
I am pleased to report that I am still here, snug as a bug in a rug, <br/>
right where my clues say I am.  I have been found as recently as <br/>
August 10 - in fact, my fresh logbook, placed in early June, is <br/>
nearly 1/3 full.<br/>
<br/>
Those who have sought but have not found me have been contacted via <br/>
private email to confirm that I am still right here, watching and <br/>
waiting for them (groan - yes I stole that line from another <br/>
letterbox in my state).<br/>
<br/>
My adopted parent, Warrior Woman, technically goes off cyberspace <br/>
from the June 1 to September 1 period, as has been the habit for the <br/>
last five years, but has been known to covertly check letterboxing <br/>
email "just in case" a box is reported damaged or missing - hence the <br/>
discovery of 7 "it's not there" emails.  I snuck onto the web because <br/>
I wanted to let seekers old and new that I am not lost, missing, or <br/>
retired.  One of my adopted brethren, Bonsai (MA), had indeed been <br/>
retired a few months ago, but this retirement is duly noted in the <br/>
database (Warrior Woman is such a stickler for keeping the database <br/>
up to date).<br/>
<br/>
And, as long as I am at it, Just Bass is just fine, too.<br/>
<br/>
Time to sneak off the web before my adopted parent finds out that I <br/>
sent this post.  No cyberspace from June 1 to September 1, them's the <br/>
rules, but sometimes rules have to be broken so that seekers know <br/>
that the truth is out there.<br/>
<br/>
See you by the sea!<br/>
