As many of you know, I was coming to the area to do some of the longer hikes, not specifically for the Winter Boxing Drive.  I was going to meet up with you all at Bartlett, then do some other boxes, then head to Flutterby's for food etc.  However, since Chrissy came down with the flu, I told her I'd step in.  Though I had all of the boxes we looked for today, it was a lot of fun!  Thanks for all of your well wishes as well!  I'm not feeling too bad, and my knees feel worse than my back right now (must be all of that getting in and out of the "boat")! <br/>
<br/>
For those people who needed assistance on the boxes.  They are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
Pioneers in Lebanon: Covered Wagon<br/>
Blue Goose in the Town Pound: Blue Goose (obviously)<br/>
Baby D Turns 2: Golf Ball<br/>
Baby D Turns 1 (I don't remember... sorry!)<br/>
Lebanon Loop 1: Book<br/>
Lebanon Loop 2: gravestone<br/>
Lebanon Loop 4: basket<br/>
<br/>
I think the rest were self explanatory?  If not, you can e-mail me off list.  We did most on the original list from Chrissy, except for My First Love and Lebanon Loop 3.  BTW.... Queen B: any news on the third Scoville box?<br/>
<br/>
Happy Snow guys.... more comes in this week.. ugh...  Can't we just turn up the heat a little??????<br/>

Well, as it turns out, I was not able to find it either. I looked with<br/>
everyone else and finally gave up. Two minutes later, one of Talking<br/>
Turtle's kids kicked a rock in the wall, and there it was!!! I don't<br/>
know if it wasn't where I remembered putting it, but I felt pretty dumb!<br/>
Anyway, I was overjoyed that it was found. I will be re-wording the<br/>
clues a little and hopefully it will be easier to find for everyone,<br/>
including myself.<br/>
It was good seeing everyone yesterday and I hope you all had a good<br/>
time. Thanks to Chrissy for doing all the arranging and to you, Music<br/>
Woman, for taking over the rest. Hope you see you all again soon.<br/>
Queen B <br/>
