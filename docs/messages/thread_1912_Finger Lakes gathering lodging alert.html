For those of you thinking about coming to the Finger Lakes gathering in <br/>

is quickly becoming scarce due to Cornell's Reunion weekend.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't already have reservations and can't find anything in Ithaca, <br/>
you might try checking the Cortland area as well. Local state parks with <br/>
camping include Taughannock Falls, Buttermilk Falls and Treman. I know at <br/>
least one family has reserved a cabin on Cayuga Lake - vacation rentals may <br/>
be a little easier to find because local schools will still be in session. <br/>
There's a new Hilton Garden Inn under construction in downtown Ithaca that <br/>
should be open next month, too. I don't know if they're taking reservations <br/>
or not yet, though.<br/>
