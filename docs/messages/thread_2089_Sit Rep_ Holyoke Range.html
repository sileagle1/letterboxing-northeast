<br/>
They were in place, however, the first box was full of water.  The log <br/>
was dry, but the actual box needs to be replaced due to its condition.<br/>
<br/>
The second box was dry, but the log was really damp.  A lot of the prior <br/>
stamps had run a bit, but other than that, the box was in fairly good <br/>
condition.<br/>
<br/>
A note to anyone else going for these.....  Don't make the same mistake <br/>
we did by going up the wrong mountain and searching for 20 minutes in <br/>
the wrong place, although the work out of climbing two mountains in one <br/>
day was a bit exhilarating.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great weekend everyone,<br/>
