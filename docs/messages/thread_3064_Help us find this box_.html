                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2018653609">Hey all ...<br/>
<br/>
In early November 2005, Team Randalstik and I planted the "Wolf <br/>
Hollow" box at the Wolf Hollow Sanctuary in Ipswich, MA.  The clues, <br/>
resident on my website at <br/>
<a href="http://home.comcast.net/~scott.e.hall/clues/Wolf_Hollow.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://home.comcast.net/~scott.e.hall/clues/Wolf_Hollow.html</a> have <br/>
also been posted to LbNA and AQ.<br/>
<br/>
To date, no one has recorded finding (or attempting to find) the box <br/>
on either site.  Now, while this does not necessarily indicate that <br/>
no one has, in fact, sought the box, I'd like to make sure it gets <br/>
at least one visit!  Who knows, maybe you could still be first <br/>
finder after 8 months.<br/>
<br/>
So, here's the request -- somebody, anybody, head on over to Ipswich <br/>
and let us know what you think of the sanctuary and the box!<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks!<br/>

<br/>
the WHAT IS SALEM? series has it's missing #4 box replanted with a  <br/>
newly carved stamp. BUT, #2 went missing.<br/>
<br/>
And the best is I have REPLACED the GOOD AND BAD SERIES, again. Newly  <br/>
carved stamps and now much smaller boxes. These boxes should survive  <br/>
longer as long as everyone is discreet and careful in rehiding.<br/>
<br/>
For those who might have missed some of those boxes from the Ice  <br/>
Scream Sunday Event back in April, well three more boxes have been  <br/>
replanted as a series.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and enjoy and I hope these very public boxes last longer  <br/>
than a week or two.<br/>

I have replaced ALL the stamps BACK in this series. Two of the stamps  <br/>
have new images so if you have done this series already and are  <br/>
coming back to Salem anyhow, now you can get a couple new stamps AND  <br/>
you would know the area so finding them will be a breeze. What a  <br/>
bonus!!!<br/>
<br/>
Stay tuned, because I bet things are going to be moved around again.  <br/>
I have subheaded this series: The Ever Changing series.<br/>
