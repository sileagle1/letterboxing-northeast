<br/>
first welcome to the letterboxing past time. your life will never be the<br/>
same again. <br/>
<br/>
st. pauls school was hit pretty hard from the flooding. i don't know if<br/>
anyone has checked on it since then or not. judging by its location i would<br/>
make a good guess that it is not, but only the placer or one that has been<br/>
there and found it before the floods can tell you for sure. <br/>
<br/>
i would suggest that you look for one that has been checked on and verified<br/>
since the floods. if you need some ideas feel free to email me off list. <br/>
<br/>
