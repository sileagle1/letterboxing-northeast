                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-361799625">Today I found all of the 5 letterboxes placed in Franklin. A rain <br/>
shower had just passed through as I parked at Bailey's Ravine. Thus, <br/>
the forest was all drippy-wet, bugs were relatively  nill and air was <br/>
a tad cooler. Note: here and at other l.b. site the rocks on trail <br/>
are very slippery when wet.  Take care.<br/>
  Mention in one logbook of bears created one of those "aha!" moments <br/>
regarding the trees which had been obviously used as gigantic <br/>
scratching posts. I plan to attach bells to my backpack on future <br/>
hikes to more remote woods as a warning to critters of the larger <br/>
sort of my approach. Generally, I'm a quiet hiker who treads lightly <br/>
in hopes of observing birds.<br/>
  I also tracked down  to the Tell Tale Apples l.b. by Irish Tinker. <br/>
I.T. is famous for retelling historic stories in an informative yet <br/>
entertaining manner. (Lovely spot but tricky clues.) This box had <br/>
moisture inside.  I doublebagged the contents. Edge of box has a <br/>
crack which is probably letting in water.  <br/>
  If you haven't yet, treat yourself to an afternoon of letterboxing <br/>
in Franklin. Clue sheets provide accurate info. re. the hikes <br/>
involved.<br/>

&lt;&lt;I doublebagged the contents.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
and we say "yeah!" I think it was CSCM who once pointed out that it <br/>
is the double ziplocks and not the rubbermaid that is most important <br/>
for keeping logbooks dry. We always double bag our own and really <br/>
appreciate it when others follow suit. If there are only two ziplocks <br/>
in a box, they're both for the log...the rubber stamp doesn't need <br/>
its own.<br/>
<br/>
We've been doing our summer rounds refreshing our letterboxes and <br/>
have also been surprised at the number that are poorly rehidden. From <br/>
the logbooks you can be pretty certain who it was that didn't care <br/>
enough to care enough. Sometimes we're a little surprised and hurt to <br/>
see familiar sig stamps as the last finders of boxes that are left <br/>
out with big "come kill me" signs to attract the Sabs.<br/>
