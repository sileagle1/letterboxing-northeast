necessarily, revised.  Just a heads up in case you printed the old <br/>
version.<br/>
<br/>
With all the recent troubles with boxes being poorly rehidden, we <br/>
thought we'd pass along some good news.  Our very first box was <br/>
placed in California, and we don't get to check on it very often, <br/>
and it's always nice to hear from a boxer who finds it.  The other <br/>
day we had such a report, and the sender mentioned that the log <br/>
showed several accidental finders.  This is very strange, as the box <br/>
cannot be seen by passers by, requires an unusual exercise by the <br/>
seeker and the removal of a substantial piece of cover!  Properly <br/>
rehidden, it's invisible, and was when this last finder found it.  <br/>
Clearly, somebody along the way must have slipped up big time in <br/>
rehiding the box.  But here's the cool part:  Every single one of <br/>
the accidental finders left a nice note, and some even tried to play <br/>
along by stamping the box's own stamp into the book.  A few were <br/>
really intrigued by letterboxing and may have become converts!  <br/>
Admittedly, we were very, very lucky, as this could easily have had <br/>
an unhappy ending.  Fortunately, somebody finally made the box <br/>
invisible again.  It's nice to be reminded every now and then that <br/>
the "right sort" are still out there!<br/>
