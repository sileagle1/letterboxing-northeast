<br/>
Only 5 out of 24 boxes made it out alive from Bluff Point.  Three were previously missing, and the rest were maliciously stolen from their hiding spots at Bluff Point.  Two of the boxes made it out alive because I accidentally screwed up the clues on the letterboxing.org site (they were correct on Atlasquest).  One made it out of sheer luck, since it was in its rightful place.  One was found under a stone in the stone wall after someone dismantled it looking for the box.  The fifth box was pulled earlier and hadn't had a chance to get back out again.<br/>
The five still alive are:<br/>
Don't Mess With Me<br/>
Pirates of the Caribbean<br/>
Peg Leg Polly<br/>
More Pirates of the New World<br/>
Scurvy Dog<br/>
<br/>
Three of the boxes, to this day, I couldn't find the hiding places for (boxes 1, 3, and Dubloons) since I didn't plant those boxes.  As with Harkness, non-traditional boxes seem to have been spared for the time being.  We are working on trying to find out why someone would do this to entire series, and will be getting the remaining five boxes back to their owners, since we are now retiring the series.<br/>

I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST ARCHIVING BOXES ON LETTERBOXING.ORG UNTIL THIS SEEMS TO BLOW OVER.<br/>

However, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; "non-traditional" boxes seem to have been spared of this<br/>
horrible event.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Only 5 out of 24 boxes made it out alive from Bluff Point. Three<br/>
were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; previously missing, and the rest were maliciously stolen from<br/>
their hiding<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; spots at Bluff Point. Two of the boxes made it out alive because I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; accidentally screwed up the clues on the letterboxing.org site (they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; were correct on Atlasquest). One made it out of sheer luck,<br/>
since it was in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; its rightful place. One was found under a stone in the stone<br/>
wall after<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; someone dismantled it looking for the box. The fifth box was<br/>
pulled earlier<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and hadn't had a chance to get back out again.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The five still alive are:<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Three of the boxes, to this day, I couldn't find the hiding<br/>
places for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (boxes 1, 3, and Dubloons) since I didn't plant those boxes. As with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Harkness, non-traditional boxes seem to have been spared for the<br/>
time being.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We are working on trying to find out why someone would do this<br/>
to entire<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; series, and will be getting the remaining five boxes back to<br/>
their owners,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; since we are now retiring the series.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST ARCHIVING BOXES ON LETTERBOXING.ORG<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; SEEMS TO BLOW OVER.<br/>

</span></blockquote>I work with surveillance equipment on a daily basis. The sad fact of<br/>
the matter, despite what we see on TV, is that photo documentation in<br/>
cases such as this is often of limited value. A camera may capture<br/>
tons of images, but unless someone knows the people in the photos,<br/>
identification can be next to impossible. Additionally, images would<br/>
have no value unless they captured someone walking away from the area<br/>
with box in hand without any successive images of the same person(s)<br/>
putting the box back in place. There is also the matter of placing<br/>
recording equipment on property other than one's own. I can't imagine<br/>
that DEP or anyone else in the state would approve of such a plan. I<br/>
have been the victim of theft and understand the violation one<br/>
experiences when property is take, but no matter how noble the cause,<br/>
law enforcement agencies take a dim view of vigilantism.<br/>
<br/>
While it might be a good idea to contact the box owner to obtain <br/>
clues, I can foresee problems for the box hunter. I like to make the<br/>
most of the time I have for letterboxing, and to that end, I often<br/>
print out clues for a number of boxes in a given area and make a day<br/>
of it. I have no problem sending requests for clues to box owners in<br/>
advance, but I would have to depend on them to read and respond to the<br/>
messages in a timely fashion. If an owner is away or otherwise<br/>
unavailable to read his or her mail, it could be frustrating for the<br/>
letterboxer. Once in a while I get the boxing bug on the spur of the<br/>
moment, and waiting for clues could put a damper on that particular<br/>
process. Also, as someone noted previously, I could have clues and not<br/>
try to find the box for weeks. If a box winds up missing a day or two<br/>
after I obtain the clues from the placer, I don't want to be accused<br/>
or blacklisted simply because I'm the last person who was given the<br/>
information. <br/>
<br/>
As to mail addresses, providers are bound by privacy laws, and can't<br/>
give out information about an account holder just because someone asks<br/>
for it. I wouldn't mind having to log in at a site in order to gain<br/>
access to clues. It doesn't provide any real security, but it might<br/>
deter the would-be poacher if he or she has to go a step beyond simply<br/>
visiting a site in order to view information.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line seems to be that there is no simple solution. My sense<br/>
is that whoever is responsible is some jerk who will tire of this<br/>
activity, hopefully sooner rather than later, and move on. I also<br/>
wonder - and this isn't meant to open a can of worms - if the<br/>
perpetrator could be a disgruntled significant other of an<br/>
enthusiastic letterboxer ("You're going letterboxing AGAIN?") who<br/>
decided to express his or her dismay by hijacking boxes in the area<br/>
where his or her partner searches for boxes. I know, it sounds a bit<br/>
sick, but stuff like this does happen.</div>
