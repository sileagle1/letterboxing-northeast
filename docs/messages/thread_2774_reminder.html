Hopefully it wasn't the last person who signed in and maybe someone who found it accidentally while poking around the cemetary.  If it was the last person, your contacting them should provide a wakeup call and hopefully some embarassment for not being a good letterboxer.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks and Enjoy!<br/>

and spring take a toll on boxes. what was well hidden in the fall might not<br/>
be so in the spring. not always is it a finders fault that the box is not<br/>
well hidden.  take note of what you are covering your boxes with. a handful<br/>
of leaves and pinecones is not going to be there come spring. under that log<br/>
might seem like a good place, but the spring rains have a tendency to sweep<br/>
away the leaves you had covering it. often times we tend to cover the<br/>
letterbox with the same materials that the placer has used, i think this is<br/>
particularly true of newbies who are leery of changing anything. so, rehide<br/>
well and plant well!<br/>

On saturday I wound up retiring one of my NJ boxes because when I went ot check up on it it wasn't hidden at all.  The box was normally under a lot of rocks, but only had one very small rock on top of it.  It really bothers me when boxes arent rehiden perfectly.  After I rehide a box I walk around and try and look from all possible angels to make sure it is not even remotely visible, and it would be my hope that others would return the favor and do it to my boxes.<br/>

Perhaps some of the exposed LBs were found by non'boxers?<br/>

<br/>
When I went to Devil's Hopyard a couple of weeks ago, I found Hopbox without <br/>
its lid on at all.  It had been left completely open, and plenty of water had <br/>
gotten inside it and subsequently froze.  The logbook was destroyed.  Now that <br/>
it's dry, you can read it, but it's not useable.  I had to put a new one in.  <br/>
Judging by the looks of it, it was a new boxing group to find it (no stamps, <br/>
little kid handwriting saying something like "This is fun!") but I wish I <br/>
could get in touch with them and say, "Look what happens when you're not careful!"<br/>
