up. <br/>
<br/>
 The Flax Pond area is the site of a very busy summer camp with 200+ <br/>
kids daily, because of these many inquiring eyes and minds; we will be <br/>
pulling and retiring this series right after Memorial Day. We can also <br/>
pull the boxes that were donated for this and send them `home' if the <br/>
owners wish us to, just contact me via AQ  on whether you would like <br/>
your box to stay or be `retired' from this area.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for the many kind words that were expressed, not only <br/>
this series but for the Great Cape Escape Gather itself!  <br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting,<br/>
