NH. We did meet Elaine Cat Lover/Teacher/Gardner and her husband <br/>
while we there. It really is a small world.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to get in touch with the Yachtsman &amp; Mary Manatee<br/>
as well as the Waterwizards if anyone has their e-mail adresses.<br/>
The e-mail for Waterwizards on this group didn't work for me.<br/>
So - if you're out there give me a shout. <br/>
<br/>
Early morning on Sunday while looking for a waterwizard's box, <br/>
we were blessed by a deer sighting. He was crossing the road.<br/>
Afterwards, while driving on a back road, a chicken ran right out in <br/>
front of us. We swerved to avoid hitting it and when we looked back <br/>
to make sure it was alright, it was running in the other direction.<br/>
So, we haven't killed any wild life recently. <br/>
<br/>
Later that day, driving on route 16 towards North Conway, from <br/>
Wildcat Mtn, a moose ran right out into the road. He didn't stop to <br/>
look both ways but luckily they have a lot of signs in NH that read <br/>
"Stop for Moose, it may save your life". Seemed like a good idea at <br/>
the time. Anyway, he made it across the street safely before I had <br/>
time to get my camera out. <br/>
<br/>
On Monday, we took advantage of the good weather to do a round of <br/>
golf. I was going for my three, lined up my shot, swung and didn't <br/>
the ball hit a poor little goose right in the leg. I felt so bad.<br/>
The little guy was fine, he shook it off and went right back to <br/>
eating the grass or whatever it is that they eat but it messed up my <br/>
three and I got a five.</div>
