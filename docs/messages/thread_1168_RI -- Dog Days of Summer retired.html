after the beached whale carcass was buried alongside the trail in the <br/>
Great Swamp.<br/>
<br/>
*That* was a letterboxing day not to be quickly forgotten!<br/>
<br/>
WarriorWoman:  "Mary, stop walking!  Shhhhh!!!! I hear something ... <br/>
sounds like a downed electrical line or something ... "<br/>
<br/>
Mary(RI):  "Yeah, what is that sound?"<br/>
<br/>
WW &amp; M(RI) are approached by two hikers.<br/>
<br/>
"You'd best stay clear of that trail.  They buried the whale there <br/>
last week.  Phewey!"<br/>
<br/>
WW &amp; M(RI) exchange glances (? what smell ?)<br/>
<br/>
As we approached, we discovered the source of the sound.  A bazillion <br/>
gazillion FLIES!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah, and the smell ;-)</div>
