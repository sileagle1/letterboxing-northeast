<br/>
</span></blockquote>Hey, Phyto!<br/>
<br/>
You're the one that deleted post #935, so perhaps you can tell <br/>
everyone why that one is missing.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Only three people have the authority to delete a given post: The <br/>
person who made it, or a moderator (of which there are two--<br/>
TeamGreenDragon and myself).  Moderators also have the special <br/>
priveledge of looking up who deleted a given post, and I can tell <br/>
you this:<br/>
<br/>
Posts 934, 935, 942, 943, and 946 were deleted by the person that <br/>
posted them.  I don't know why they deleted them or if they'd rather <br/>
stay annonyous so nobody pesters them about why they deleted their <br/>
posts, so I'm not saying anything about who the posts belonged to.  <br/>
(Except you, Phyto, since I thought it highly amusing that you were <br/>
confused when one of the posts in question was your own, and you--or <br/>
someone using your account--deleted it. *smile*)<br/>
<br/>
Which, I might add, people deleting their own posts is remarkably <br/>
common.  Far more posts get deleted by the person who posted them <br/>
than by moderators.  (In fact, as far as I know, only those last <br/>
three posts mentioned were EVER deleted by a moderator on this talk <br/>
list.)<br/>
<br/>
The last three posts were deleted by TeamGreenDragon, presumably <br/>
because he considered them spam, in bad taste, vulgar, or whatever.  <br/>
I didn't see the posts before they were deleted and don't know the <br/>
contents.  (Even the all-powerful moderators can't resurrect a <br/>
deleted post, proving once and for all that there is no such thing <br/>
as an 'all-powerful' moderator. *wink*)<br/>
<br/>
But--here's the thing--some people have e-mails sent for every post <br/>
to this talk list, and an e-mail cannot be recalled.  So even though <br/>
the post will no longer show up on the talk list, it is still <br/>
resting in some people's e-mail box, and they'll reply to the post <br/>
not realizing that the post they're replying to has already been <br/>
deleted and anyone not getting the e-mails will be highly confused <br/>
about what is being replied to.<br/>
<br/>
So in a nutshell, there's a new Letterboxing Connecticut group that <br/>
someone was promoting, but the posts relating to it were deleted.  <br/>
(Knowing Brian, I'm sure it was for a good reason, even if I don't <br/>
know what it is.)  <br/>
<br/>
And there's been no mass-deletion of lots of posts by the <br/>
moderators.  Just three.  Which, out of nearly 1,000 posts, isn't <br/>
too bad at all!<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, WOW!  Almost a thousand posts and 150 members on <br/>
this board!  You guys rock!  =)  You've all done a great job making <br/>
this a successful and terrific talk list that requires *almost* no <br/>
intervention on the part moderators.  Thanks for all your efforts!<br/>
<br/>

</span></blockquote>It was a case of the foot caught partway in the mouth at that moment.<br/>
I like the ability to delete posts and (somewhat) edit them. I don't always have a cup <br/>
of coffee in the morning before I hit the *reply* button and sometimes that is not <br/>
smart! <br/>
<br/>
Now why in all creation would someone want email delivery of talk lists posts is really <br/>
beyond all comprehension in my mind, but that is ok - I've been a member of talk list <br/>
groups for a while, but I would never in my left mind consider email digest form...<br/>
<br/>
Ok ---&gt; now out with it right?<br/>
<br/>
I deleted that post because it contained content pertaining to my frustration at the <br/>
event logbooks being confused at the "Letterboxing at Laudholm" gathering...and I'll <br/>
now offer my ramble about it. I think not everyone at the event signed into the <br/>
logbook. I usually wouldn't care, but since I made the lobgook especially for that <br/>
event and was stressing about the amount of 100% cotton paper to put inside the <br/>
binding I was a bit frustrated that not eveyone signed it. Oh well right!?<br/>
<br/>
In future my suggestion that I had in that post was that event-only stamp and logs <br/>
should be handled with GREAT care. The event stamp at the P.O.E. gathering was <br/>
done very nicely - not only was the stamp that Brian carved a WORK OF ART...but <br/>
Warrior Woman and Brian supervised the sign-in cue at the gazebo - so it was a great <br/>
starting point to the gathering and I sure bet that they got at least 100 of those <br/>
stamps in their log. <br/>
<br/>
I'm done.<br/>
Thanks for asking!</div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1082533345">Interesting comment. We actually PREFER digest form. Frankly, with <br/>
the high traffic of the big list it became a pain in the rear to wade <br/>
through all the "stuff" that got posted and the "re:re:re:re:re:" <br/>
posts.  Email 'digest' simply gives you a once-a-day listing of what <br/>
gets slung.  Much easier to scroll down and selectively view the <br/>
topics and comments. And digest form preserves all the posts before <br/>
they get deleted too! <br/>
<br/>
The individual e-mail function would likely cause a major mailbox jam <br/>
given the traffic of the lists also. We reserve it for lists where <br/>
you might get only 1 or 2 messages a day, such as my National <br/>
Collegiate EMS list. <br/>
