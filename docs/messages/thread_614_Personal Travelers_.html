                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-288078415">Alright I have two things to address...<br/>
<br/>
Pigtographer and I will be attending the May Day Gather this coming <br/>
Sunday - I am so excited to be going to this!!!  Even though this <br/>
will be our fifth gathering (Cape Caper, POE, SGSP Mini and <br/>
Mapsurfer's Mystery Ungathering...yep! All 4 so far!) we'll always be <br/>
exchanging with letterboxers new and old to the sport.<br/>
<br/>
How many personal travelers have been mentioned on this talk list for <br/>
the upcoming May Gathering?  I know that many letterboxers give you <br/>
the question when you are there - but some decide to post it here and <br/>
you need to whisper to them just the answer...<br/>
<br/>
...so how many people have done a PT and posted it on the list??  <br/>
I've seen two at the most, I may have overlooked a few...<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe I'm just feeling a bit lazy and I should look for them <br/>
myself...hahaha...<br/>
<br/>
**I also have a personal traveler that has FINALLY been completed...**<br/>
<br/>
Although letterboxing is a hobby for me (and an obsession), I do have <br/>
another obsession, however not many favor this one...<br/>
<br/>
The wonderful world of Reality TV.  OK, OK, time for you to laugh at <br/>
me...heehee.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite reality tv shows is Survivor.  Each season 16 <br/>
people are given the chance to outwit, outplay and outlast each other <br/>
to win a prize of $1,000,000.  Survivor is now close to five years <br/>
old, and in its eighth season.  112 people have competed on the first <br/>
seven seasons, and eighteen of the best were invited back to compete <br/>
in the latest season: Survivor 8: All Stars.<br/>
<br/>
-+-<br/>
<br/>
My personal traveler deals with Survivor.  In order to get my <br/>
personal traveler, you must take me aside and list all eight <br/>
locations where each of the eight seasons of Survivor took place.  <br/>
You don't have to be extremely specific - the location is most <br/>
readily found in the title of each season of Survivor, and there can <br/>
be many different answers (most of which, I'm sure, will suffice).  <br/>
Make sure to do this discreetly so we don't attract attention...feel <br/>
free to list the locations on a piece of paper so that it will be <br/>
easier to remember.  Also, if on the chance that you remember I have <br/>
a P.T., and you didn't bring your answers or you don't remember the <br/>
answers I will have a clue sheet available.  It will also be <br/>
available for the overly curious people who find out that I have a <br/>
P.T. too...hahaha...<br/>
<br/>
So all you have to do is find where each season of Survivor was <br/>
located.  Good luck, and I hope to see everybody at the gathering!</div>
