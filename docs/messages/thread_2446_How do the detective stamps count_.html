count? Are they considered a Find?<br/>
<br/>
This was my first gathering ( I sure picked a good one!) but I'm not sure what category <br/>
they fall under. I'm learning as I go with help from other boxers. Thanks in advance!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I put the photos that Mark Pepe put on his website along with the stamped images <br/>
into a small scrapbook and I feel like I'm there all over again! What a great day.</div>
