found Bowers Spring in Harvard MA and McGovern Brook in Lancaster MA.  <br/>
These have both been removed for updating and will be replaced (and <br/>
adopted) soon.  I was unable to find Rocky Brook in Sterling MA, <br/>
although I think I was in the right place.  I have no plans at this <br/>
time to replace this box.  Perhaps someone closer to the Sterling area <br/>
would be interested?  Songbird</div>
