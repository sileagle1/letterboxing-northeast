I know of) who are rooming at the Super 8 Motel, 482 N Main St, <br/>
Leominster MA.  978.537.2800<br/>
<br/>
So far: <br/>
Knights of Columbo (VA)<br/>
sewsowbizzy (VA)<br/>
phinstarr (NY)<br/>
<br/>
We are planning to rally in the lobby at 9PM Fri for a Super8 pre-<br/>
mini-gathering, complete with event stamp.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is arriving earlier let me know (sowbiz @ yahoo . com) so <br/>
we can maybe dine together.<br/>
<br/>
Knights of Columbo and sewsowbizzy will be flying into Boston around <br/>
noon and driving to Leominster - boxing enroute.  Can't say exactly <br/>
when we will arrive -- just how many boxes are there between Boston <br/>
and Leominster?<br/>
<br/>
See all y'all there then<br/>
