that blew through Massachusetts on Friday?  The storm felled a lot of<br/>
trees near me in Bellingham.  I wonder how many letterboxes were in<br/>
jeopardy as trees -- sometimes HUGE ones -- fell all over the area.<br/>
<br/>
If you have boxes in any of the areas hit by the storm, I urge you to<br/>
do a little box maintenance if you didn't over the weekend.  "Fallen<br/>
log" now has a whole new meaning out there!!<br/>
