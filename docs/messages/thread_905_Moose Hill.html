cavylovers trillium box at Moose Hill.  YAY!  I don't know how you all <br/>
remember each other, too many names and faces for me to have even slight <br/>
recall.  But it was fun seeing everyone's stamps.  I think I'm more <br/>
interested in finding boxes than collecting stamps though it seemed this <br/>
group was more interested in the reverse ;-)<br/>
Enjoy this great weather and Happy summer boxing to all!<br/>

Moose Hill Gathering.  Had a great afternoon exchanging and searching<br/>
for a couple of boxes.  Thanks for all the work of organizing the<br/>
event.<br/>
