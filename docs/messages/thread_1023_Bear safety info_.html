one. If, by some outside chance, a bear is anywhere near you, it will most <br/>
likely smell or see you first and run away. Also, boxing alone and/or at <br/>
night is risky for a number of reasons; unpredicted weather changes, injury, <br/>
bears, psychotic escaped convicts, etc. If you do venture out alone, bring a <br/>
cell phone. Anyway, back to the bears... For the record, bear attacks in <br/>
North America are very rare. On average, they only occur about 15 times per <br/>
year and only 3 of them will result in death. The vast majority of these <br/>
attacks are in Canada and the western U.S. so you have little to worry <br/>
about. But, if you are still concerned, here are a few suggestions:<br/>
Avoid strong-smelling items; especially perfume. Bug spray is ok.<br/>
Keep any food in air-tight containers<br/>
Carry pepper spray (this is also useful for those pesky escaped convicts)<br/>
If a bear approaches you, spray the pepper spray at its eyes, nose, and <br/>
mouth. Once the bear is blinded by the spray, leave the area as quickly as <br/>
possible by backing up slowly NOT running. Running will trigger the bear's <br/>
chase instinct.<br/>
Also, DO NOT apply the pepper spray to your gear as the strong smell may <br/>
actually attract bears.<br/>
If you find yourself under attack with no opportunity to use pepper spray, <br/>
try to appear bigger than you really are by waving your arms, backpack, etc. <br/>
Fight back, make lots of noise, and try to appear dominant and the bear will <br/>
back down. DO NOT play dead.<br/>
<br/>
You really have very little to be concerned about in CT as far as bears go <br/>
but it's always good to be prepared!<br/>
<br/>
Happy and safe boxing!<br/>

&gt;Subject: [LbNE] CT - What  about bears?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was out boxing last night and ended up being longer than I<br/>
&gt;thought.  Darkness was coming (in the woods anyways).  I saw some<br/>
&gt;deer which were beautiful to see. But then it dawned on me.  There<br/>
&gt;are bears in CT (and other places as well).  What do you do as a<br/>
&gt;letterboxer if you come across one?  Does anyone carry anything that<br/>
&gt;would help?  Just a thought....I am usually out boxing by myself<br/>
&gt;although I leave notice as to where I will be.  Last night's walk<br/>
&gt;was pretty far into the woods.<br/>

at best.  Many areas have no signal or quite poor signal.  Don't depend on them<br/>
and allow yourself to take chances just because you think you have easy<br/>
communications or rescue at hand.  I teach hunter safety courses and this is a<br/>
point we constantly have to make - people think they work everywhere.  They<br/>
don't.<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry about bears.  They want to encounter you a LOT less than you want<br/>
an encounter with them.<br/>
