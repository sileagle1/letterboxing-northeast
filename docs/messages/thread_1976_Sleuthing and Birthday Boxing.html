with Fabulous stamps.  Great Job guys- I wonder how long it took for <br/>
you to do those clues? Hmmmm.  Many Thanks to AM&amp;PM ( and TM,too).<br/>
Also, the brandy new birthday series at Gillette's Castle for <br/>
Flutterby is a wonderful quest as well.  I will suggest that you bring <br/>
markers- it will be worth it!!  A BIG Happy Birthday to you, <br/>
Flutterby, and many more.--Sunshine, Swamp Yankee, and the ToadDog  :0)</div>

East Granby. They were all in good shape and gave us a good workout.<br/>
<br/>
As an added bonus, we got to see some raptors in flight from one of the <br/>
lookouts, and they were actually soaring below us not far off the edge of <br/>
the cliff so we could see them from above as they flew, which is quite <br/>
different from looking at their silhouettes in the sky from below! It was <br/>
awesome! I think they were turkey vultures.<br/>
