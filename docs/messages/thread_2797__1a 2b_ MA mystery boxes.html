</span></blockquote>Bwahahahaha!  Then you'll appreciate this.  I saw the incline, and <br/>
decided "Hey, a free workout!" and decided to run UP the hill.  When I <br/>
*finally* got to the top of the hill, I jumped around with my fists in <br/>
the air, singing the tune to "Rocky" at the top of my lungs.  Then I <br/>
saw a few couples at the top of hill having their lunch who had stopped <br/>
in mid-bite to stare at me.<br/>
