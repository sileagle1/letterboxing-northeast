planted under placer "Morgun."  I was afraid my hard, or long, or <br/>
lame-stamp placements were causing people to avoid the fine "Tiny <br/>
Turtle" placements.  Her boxes (Walks...., and Stone Turtle) have <br/>
become popular anyway.  Morgun boxes in that account will be labeled <br/>
as such.<br/>
<br/>
In order to have a better reputation as a planter (&amp; give some boxers <br/>
a more pleasant experience) I am makig a few more changes:<br/>
<br/>
8 boxes went missing or were retired:<br/>
Christmas Spirit (3) gone - <br/>
Unlisted &amp; temporary boxes (4) will be removed later this year (still <br/>
lots of time, except for unlisted "Suzy" which I will remove) <br/>
Cliffs box (1) retired in place - clues deleted.<br/>
<br/>
Plans to retire/remove &amp; replace with a new box, better stamp &amp; <br/>
shorter clues<br/>
(no hurry - may remove in December)<br/>
Clearings (1 box)<br/>
Middlesex Canal 2 (1 box)<br/>
<br/>
No decision yet<br/>
Middlesex Canal One<br/>
Indian Grinding Stone<br/>
<br/>
No changes to these fine boxes<br/>
Octopus (3)<br/>
Summer Cottage for Let (1)<br/>
Notice (1)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to do Middlesex Canal 2 without the poison ivy, you <br/>
can walk along the unused tracks off Rodgers street to the canal.  <br/>
Clearings is in a nice walking area, if you live nearby it can <br/>
provide an additional find.<br/>
<br/>
enjoy,<br/>
