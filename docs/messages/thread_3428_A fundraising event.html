This May I will be walking the Boston Avon Walk for Breast Cancer.  <br/>
I'm doing this because March 1st marked the 1 year anniversary of my <br/>
diagnosis of breast cancer.  (Treatment is over, and I'm clear of <br/>
cancer!)<br/>
<br/>
To help raise money for the walk I am hosting a fundraising party in <br/>
Franklin, MA.  I've decided to have an "event" box, as well as some <br/>
of my postals that are now home, at the party.  This could be a <br/>
perfect time to start your spring exchnages as well as dance off some <br/>
off those winter pounds (I know I need to) before we all gear up for <br/>
a season full of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
This is an important cause to me, for obvious reasons. It would mean <br/>
the world to me to have some of my boxing neighbors join us for a <br/>
good time for a good cause.<br/>
<br/>
DETAILS:<br/>
Date: March 30th<br/>
Time: 6:00 PM<br/>
Location: Elk's Lodge Franklin, MA<br/>
Donation: $25 single $40 couples (tax deductible)<br/>
Dinner Buffet, DJ, Door prizes, raffles, and letterboxes<br/>
Contact: Lisa at familyfrommass@ aol.com<br/>
<br/>
Please contact me if you think you can come.  If you want to help the <br/>
cause, but can't make it to the party, you can make a donation to me <br/>
or my team members at the following link:  <br/>
