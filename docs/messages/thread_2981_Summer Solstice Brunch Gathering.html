after this wonderful day of boxing with friends new and old......<br/>
<br/>
The day beginning with a wonderfully orginal creative clue format.( <br/>
or rather perhaps a clue menu is better). Nautilus and Hattie both <br/>
worked their tails off to give us another special Maine <br/>
Gathering...I know that we had cloudy skies and the occasional <br/>
sprinkle of rain, but the menu, maps and boxes were excellent.<br/>
<br/>
(Although I did have to promise Oldhounder better weather for future <br/>
gatherings after the chill of Frightnight and the less than sunny <br/>
weather we got today.. Like we kokopellians have sun control...lol)<br/>
<br/>
The carvings were all unique and provide I thought a varied <br/>
perspective on summer solstice.<br/>
<br/>
And the MOST important element was the people... From vets <br/>
Oldhounder &amp; Siamese, Team Safari to new boxers like the buxton <br/>
gang, Lady SLPA, Nittany and so many of us in between.. This is the <br/>
part of the hobby which I sincerely hold closest.<br/>
<br/>
(I must thank Lady SLPA publically for her T shirt, those who attend <br/>
will know what I mean)!!!<br/>
<br/>
( Buxton Gang you guys are awesome, thanks for being my trail mates <br/>
today....Just keep working on the Gnome quest.. and that will insure <br/>
I see ya again soon....)<br/>
<br/>
To Orion I wish you and I always had an extra hour in the events to <br/>
discuss the topics we attempt to :)<br/>
<br/>
Again a LOUD and very PUBLIC  THANK YOU!  to Hattie, her mom and the <br/>
wonderful Nautilus......<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see alot of you guys at the Greek Gathering in Wendall, MA <br/>
in a couple weeks!!!<br/>
