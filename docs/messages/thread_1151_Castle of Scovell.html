is the bonus for the castle. In looking at the log book for the <br/>
castle itself, it looks like the last person to stamp in <br/>
was "Potamus." Does that name sound familiar to anyone? I would like <br/>
to find out if the bonus box was there when this person was there <br/>
since they mentioned the bonus when they signed the log book. If <br/>
anyone knows Potamus, could you please have them contact me at <br/>
