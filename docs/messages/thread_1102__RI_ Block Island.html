If you're leaving from Pt. Judith, I was snooping around on the site last week and saw some boxes there.  When are you going?<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1629198946">We had a lovely day on Block Island (Wednesday), but were less lucky <br/>
than usual in finding boxes. Course it didn't help that I forgot the <br/>
compass in our dash out in the morning!<br/>
<br/>
We did find Southeast Lighthouse Letterbox- its fine.<br/>
<br/>
North Lighthouse Letterbox is located in an area that is cordoned <br/>
off with signs asking people to keep off in order to protect/restore <br/>
the dunes. So, we couldn't check on that one. Frustrating as we <br/>
could see the landmark, but gotta respect the environment.<br/>
<br/>
Tried for White Rock at Black Rock, but either we took a wrong turn <br/>
or we just weren't on the same wave-length as the placer. When we <br/>
got down to the ocean, we couldn't match up the landmarks. So, we <br/>
didn't get close enough to have an idea whether its there or not. Oh <br/>
well, had a nice walk.<br/>
<br/>
Tried briefly for the Indian Cemetery Lighthouse, but since I <br/>
couldn't check the compass direction, I didn't want to mess up the <br/>
lovely old rock wall scrounging around. Have to try it again someday <br/>
when I am better equipped. While there a nice fellow stopped to <br/>
chat - saw us looking around (its right next to the road) and <br/>
wondered if we were geocaching, which he was interested in. He <br/>
hadn't heard about letterboxing, so we gave him some info. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We did find the Clayhead box and we so happy we went there. The <br/>
trail is shady and pretty and the beach at the end of the trail is <br/>
gorgeous! Definitely a highlight of the day.<br/>
<br/>
We also found Treasure Chest at Sandy Point. <br/>
<br/>
Have to get back there to look for the rest!<br/>
