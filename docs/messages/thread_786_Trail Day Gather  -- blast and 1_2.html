cracked up to be. All who went the distance into this morning were <br/>
treated to a quartet of event stamps comemmerating each stage of the <br/>
evening. Then it was off to the nighttime letterboxing,("Things that <br/>
go bump in the Night") another five oh Alan's treats hidden off in <br/>
the dark of night. Flshlights in hand, we all braved the endless <br/>
darkness to collect the images. After returning from our adventure, <br/>
we were pleasantly surprised to find that Erik the Ram had stopped by <br/>
to say hello. Then, just when you thought it was all over, there was <br/>
a rustle in the bushes and who should sail in at the very last <br/>
minute, but Wanda and Pete!! Fresh off a plane from Seattle, they set <br/>
up camp and collected the images into their books before going to <br/>
bed. Stories by the campfire, fresh roasted smores and lots of <br/>
exchanges filled in the rest of the day and night- and at the end, no <br/>
one was sorry they had braved the trip. It was an excellent gather <br/>
and great fun for everyone. I would do it all again in a new york <br/>
minute. Thanks Alan, you're the best.        ---Northstar</div>
