                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1798806135">Last weekend PowWow Dancer and I were doing the Presidential Animals <br/>
in Coventry, CT.  In the second box 'Jack the Turkey', in addition to <br/>
Jack and the boxe's logbook, we found another ziplock with a small <br/>
square commercial stamp depicting a cartoon of a little girl, along <br/>
with a pinkish cat-eye stamp pad... but... no logbook!<br/>
<br/>
In the box's logbook we looked back three or so entries and finally <br/>
found one that said 'Dropped off the Suzie-Q Hitch Hiker' -- so we <br/>
found out the name of this little girl.  We've no idea where the <br/>
logbook might have got off to.  If anyone might have picked it by <br/>
accident, or hear's of Suzie-Q's logbook please drop us an email so <br/>
we can re-unite them.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, we'll make a new logbook for her? and set Suzie-Q on her <br/>
way, in the hopes that she might eventually find her way back home <br/>
(re: there's no contact for the placer when the logbook gets full).<br/>
<br/>
Hope to hear something on her!<br/>

please post an email so we can exchange a postal address and get her <br/>

planted her with.  Many thanks!<br/>
