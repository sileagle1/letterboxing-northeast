We are happy to report that Percival the Plastic Flamingo was found safe and<br/>
sound. Thanks also to Don Featherstone, the inventor of the pink plastic<br/>
flamingo, who made a special appearance in honor of Percival.<br/>
<br/>
The day was wonderful. The exchanges copious and the food wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and Wanda and Pete, our carpooling partners for the day extend their<br/>
thanks as well.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>

<br/>
Alright, this was our first Event. But I believe that this was a pretty darn<br/>
phenomenal as events go. I can't even imagine organizing something like<br/>
this. You guys did a fantastic job. We had a lot of fun. It took us a bit to<br/>
understand what was happening, in fact the first clue we went to (Jessica<br/>
Fletcher) was in such character and we were not aware, we simply thought she<br/>
was explaining to us that she was a writer of mysteries and this is how she<br/>
got involved with letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Oh I get. She was telling us to guess who she was. After about two clues, we<br/>
understood what was going on. The greatest thing is everybody was just<br/>
having fun and wanted everyone else to have fun. You truly succeeded.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all very much for your hard work and ENTHUSIASM! My kids were<br/>
wired because they were having so much fun and crashed 10 minutes into the<br/>
ride home. Always appreciative of that.<br/>
<br/>
Our pair of signed pink flamingos will be cherished as much as Percival, and<br/>
maybe someday it truly may go missing and we will have to call on all<br/>
detectives again.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
