<br/>
The Mama Bandits will have the opportunity to ditch the Baby Bandits for the day tomorrow thanks to a Papa Bandit's day off and a visiting Grandma. YIPPEEE!<br/>
<br/>
We need a couple of quick and easy boxes that can be snagged considering present weather conditions.<br/>
<br/>
We're on I84 right on the Hudson, so we can do Western CT.  We'd go up to an hour and a half in to CT provided we don't have to venture too far off of I84 on the far end.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestons would be greatly appreciated.  I was looking a the Danbury boxes... any advice as to seasonal appropriateness?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for suggestions,<br/>
<br/>
