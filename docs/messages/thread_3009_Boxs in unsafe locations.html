and if i feel like something is unsafe like crossing a river, its my<br/>
choice not to. But today looking for boxs i ran into 2 Teenage hangouts.<br/>
Felt nervous and left quickly...but im old and not- good looking, <br/>
what if 2 good looking girls go looking. you are so far out on a dirt<br/>
rd,that you would never find help.<br/>
  I know the person who put these boxs out did't know, he is a male and<br/>
he put them out before school closes and hot weather.<br/>
But this person does a great job of putting out boxs and i don't<br/>
know how to tell him there in unsafe locations with out him getting<br/>
mad at me. I feel ok in parks,State or federal forests, even graveyards,<br/>
But just to drive around --look for dirt roads in deserated areas- i<br/>
dont know...</div>
