We spent a while looking for the "Sheep Pasture" as <br/>

Rustypuff here again!<br/>
<br/>
I live in nearby Holbrook and can recommend a few good boxes within a half <br/>
hour of where you are.<br/>
<br/>
Check out DW's Imprints right in your own backyard.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of boxes in the Blue Hills. <br/>
My personal favorite is Birdhouse in Needham.<br/>
And don't forget to decipher some of the mystery boxes. You'll find that some <br/>
are not too far away.<br/>
<br/>
Contact me off list if you want more details.<br/>
<br/>
Of course there are a number of boxes at Moose Hill in Sharon where we'll be <br/>
gathering on June 27.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
-Kim (Rustypuff)<br/>

</span></blockquote>Welcome to the LbNE.  When we first started letterboxing, we had trouble finding every box.  One box took us 3 different days to find.  I was ready to give up on letterboxing.  On the 3rd day we found it and 900+ finds later, having a great time.Were eeting GREAT people (and dogs). We hope to meet you someday....Teach and Preach</div>
