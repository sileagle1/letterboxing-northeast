Great day boxes out for us to hunt up before feasting on Frybread ?? <br/>
that Rush Gather made for us . What a treat.  thanks and yum yum<br/>
Then most paired up and off we went in all directions.  The stamps are<br/>
so well crafted and planted on great trails.  I can't wait to get out<br/>

So much work went into this and I thank everyone .  We are so lucky to<br/>

in the beautiful fall weather.  Truely it is one of the best and well <br/>
planned out series I have seen along with the MMM (of course).<br/>

Butterfly is right...the trees were "dressed for the occasion" while <br/>
the leaves danced to tribal music and a good time was had by all. <br/>

Special thanks goes to all the carvers, planters and organizers.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-592689982">Thanks to everyone who've made The Four Directions series possible.  <br/>
We'd like to thank Koyote who conceived the idea and the locations <br/>
along the Mohawk Trail., and introducing someone who's grown up in <br/>
that area to new incredible places.  Thanks to the entirty of <br/>
TheEndGang for their patience in getting this series off the <br/>
ground!   This part of Connecticut, a portion of the old AT, exhibits <br/>
such rugged beauty and floral uniqueness that it's simply not to be <br/>
overlooked.  Nearly every section of the trail offers some breath <br/>
taking vistas, seasonal fog permitting!    I'd stress to take your <br/>
time with this series, and even venture further down these trails <br/>
with time permitting... PowWow Dancer and I are planning to do the <br/>
Coltsfoot Mountain section this november.<br/>
<br/>
The gathering for the release of this series was just perfect, and we <br/>
thank all those that attended, and hope those that could not attend <br/>
will explore the series at their leisure down the road.    A big <br/>
thankyou to Mark for doing outstanding organizing, website work and <br/>
graphics layout for Koyote and us. It was a great gather to chat and <br/>
hike together and learn a little more about what everyone's interests <br/>
are.  I thourougly enjoyed my time with Butterfly and I hope we can <br/>
get out and box and talk plants and trees together sometime!    I <br/>
have to thank Sojourner for all the time contributed, not only in <br/>
helping with planting, but also with the last minute under pressure <br/>
stamp carving requests, your carvings are excuisite.   (We really <br/>
liked Molly!).  We cant believe Phynstar and Rubaduc did two <br/>
sections!! WOW power boxers!! You go girls!! *smile.  We hope we can <br/>
keep up with you guys!  Rubaduc you missed the event stamp log!! (Can <br/>
I stamp you in with our upcoming new carving?)   We really enjoyed <br/>
our conversations again with Wanda and Pete, and hope the old AT <br/>
brings back some good memmories too.  Finally, but certainly not <br/>
lastly, we enjoyed doing Koyote's Chief Joseph box with Sadie and <br/>
Russ.   I *have to thank my sister the LeafLady for her support and <br/>
all around sister-stuff. (She thanks Music Woman for finding her <br/>
compas).<br/>
<br/>
The frybread actually worked!!  The dough was pure 'Cherokee gold' if <br/>
I might coin a phrase.  Contributed by longtime friends Mikki <br/>
Aganstada (Eastern Band Cherokee) and Sherman Paul (Maliseet) who've <br/>
been cooking frybread as Native American Cuisine for some 25 <br/>
years...   We were smiled upon and my coleman stove reached the <br/>
perfect 350 - 375 degree frying temperature and the rest was Frybread <br/>
Power history!! What better way to send people off to the Four <br/>
Directions!  Thank you guys for enjoying my little tokens of <br/>
appreciation for your support!<br/>
