We webmasters at LbNA have received two notes from nonboxers about accidental finds in Hopkinton. One we were able to identify and hopefully will be replaced (Bailey's Box). The other one is more of a mystery, but I'm sure the knowledgeable folks here will help identify it and get it replaced. Here is the note:<br/>
