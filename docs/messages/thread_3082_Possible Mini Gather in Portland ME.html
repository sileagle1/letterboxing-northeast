moderately sized groups of people--We once had a table for 22).  It is pricey for pizza <br/>

<br/>
On one of the other site we are getting alot of interest for having <br/>
the mini gathering at a place called acoustic coffee (cafe) on <br/>
Danforth Street....<br/>
It has apparently all kinds of room. soups, sandwiches, and Coffee &amp; <br/>
Teas!<br/>
Would that be a possibility....<br/>
I will contact Casco Bay Painter for you...<br/>
<br/>
You might want to check on the CBB site for some of the Chat...<br/>

For purposes of clarification, the coffeehouse is at 67 India Street<br/>
(that's the roastery on Washington Avenue, and it is a bit more<br/>
limited spacewise). <br/>
