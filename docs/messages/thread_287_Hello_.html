this talk list now...glad to see that there is now a separate talk <br/>
list for New Englanders - well, with all those CT boxers...ha ha ha.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Curious Crane for printing out an extra set of directions <br/>
to the POE Gathering - without those, I wouldn't have found this site.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of the POE Gathering - very excited to see many people we <br/>
havn't met.  Our last gathering (The Cape Caper, 10/4/03) ended up <br/>
being on the same day as the CT Forest Gathering.  However, we got to <br/>
meet a multitude of boxers whose stamps we've seen on the trail - <br/>
great stamps from everywhere!<br/>

P.S. - Question: How does everyone count a HH made by them?  Do you <br/>
count it as a 'P', or would it fall under the 'HH' category?</div>

<br/>
  Welcome!  You're going to have a lot of fun with this hobby and there are quite a few NY letterboxers in your area.  If you're ever on the trails in CT, hope to see you there!<br/>

  Enjoy!<br/>

<br/>
So glad to have you in the community.  I'm Heather the Sparky Butterfly from CT but I am moving up to Watertown NY in the fall.  I have tons of boxes I've carved and am looking forward to planting up there if you would like to join on some planting when I get up there.  Hope all is well<br/>
