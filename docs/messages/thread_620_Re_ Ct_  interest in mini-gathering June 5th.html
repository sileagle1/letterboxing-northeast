there yet despite living a mere half hour away. Thanks for planning <br/>
it. Just be sure to give me good driving directions to the spot. I am <br/>
so direction clueless. The hobby of letterboxing provides me with  <br/>
remedial education in how to tell my left from my right, a sister <br/>
tree from a woodpecker tree.<br/>
