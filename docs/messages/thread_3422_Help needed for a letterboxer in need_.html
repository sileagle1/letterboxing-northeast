Purpleintexkim, has been dealing with some major ordeals, including <br/>
her husband being seriously ill (injured?), and now a bad storm has <br/>
destroyed their storage shed with all of their children's summer <br/>
clothing, blankets, quilts, collectible items, and anything they had <br/>
to store because they live in a small home.  Thankfully, the house <br/>
had no damage, however, they lost a lot.  (Though, no letterboxing <br/>
supplies were lost ;-)<br/>
<br/>
They happen to have a Walmart near their home in Texas, and I was <br/>
wondering if anyone from the snowy north would like to donate $ <br/>
towards a Walmart gift card, so they can start replacing some of <br/>
their lost items.  I feel that one card would be easier than multiple <br/>
small denomination cards.  I have a paypal account and would be <br/>
willing to centrally locate the donations to send one Walmart card.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to donate quilts or blankets, or children's summer <br/>
clothes directly, I can get a list of children's sizes.<br/>
