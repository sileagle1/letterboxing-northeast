enough of this on there, anyway:<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we found the Smith's Castle letterbox in Wickford, RI. <br/>
Being an enormous box, it's kinda hard to hide, but it's hidden <br/>
now... better than when I spotted it.<br/>
<br/>
The other box we found, Grandma's Letterbox, wasn't hidden at all. I <br/>
spotted it from 40 feet away. It was just as bad as the photo from <br/>
Silent Doug and Clueless that appeared in Mark &amp; Sue's blog. <br/>
<br/>
Actually it was worse. The lid wasn't fastened, and the bag <br/>
containing the stamp and ink pad were full water. At least the <br/>
logbook had been placed right on top of the bundle of bags (no, it <br/>
wasn't bagged), so it was relatively dry. Whether the last finder <br/>
was a true boxer or not, I don't know. There was no stamp-in on the <br/>
last used page, just handwriting. It was a child, probably under 10, <br/>
judging by the handwriting. <br/>
<br/>
So when I replaced the box, after drying it and supplying fresh <br/>
baggies, I used a small rock to dig out some loose dirt from under <br/>
the big rock and give the box more room under the big rock. Then I <br/>
arranged as many rocks as I could in front of the hidey hole. There <br/>
wasn't much else I could do, as this area is maintained to some <br/>
degree, and it appears that any plant debris is removed or blown <br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
Just a case in point to illustrate the re-hiding problems we all <br/>
encounter from time to time.<br/>
