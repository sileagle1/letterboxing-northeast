<br/>
It's unclear how to really reach the placers of this box (though I <br/>
did post in their guestbook on their webpage which hasn't been <br/>
updated for a loooong time). If anyone knows their email address, <br/>
please either forward it along or let them know the status.<br/>
<br/>
For all those planning to get this one, the stamp is gone and the <br/>
logbook was soaked. We made repairs best we could. The view is <br/>
lovely!<br/>
<br/>
Also, highly recommended in that area: Trekking for Tracks...what a <br/>
wonderful refuge!<br/>
