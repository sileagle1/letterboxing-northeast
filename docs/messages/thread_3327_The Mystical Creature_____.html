searching.  As you probably saw, the last few people <br/>
listed "attempted" rather than "found", so it's not you!  A few months <br/>
ago, Butterfly, Sadie and Russ and I poked around without success, but <br/>
I still want to go back again.  I've listed its status in AQ <br/>
as "unknown" until I find it or not.  Thanks for the reminder.  Hope <br/>
you were successful with that "other" Giant box that had been eluding <br/>
you ;-)<br/>
