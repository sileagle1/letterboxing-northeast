boxes that they sell at Ocean State Job Lot, called "Freshness <br/>
Keepers."  I usually use the 900ml/30oz size which is about the same <br/>
size as the standard Lock N Lock I see out on the trails.  Today I was <br/>
doing some shopping and saw an even smaller size at Job Lot.  These <br/>
are 400ml/13.5oz.  The Box messures about 3.5x5.5x2.  They seem to be <br/>
just as waterproof, and the best part is they are only $.89.  Just <br/>
thought I would pass it along to anyone interested.<br/>
