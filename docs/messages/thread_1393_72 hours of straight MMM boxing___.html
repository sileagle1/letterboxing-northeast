                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1807811477">... with a little sleep time.  The Dawnlanders had the MOST EXCELLENT <br/>
long weekend searching the MMM boxes with friends and family and met <br/>
so many great boxers on the trail, we cant express our appreciation <br/>
for the organizers but also for all the AMAZING carvings and log book <br/>
creations, not to mention the one day event boxes that were so <br/>
creative!!  <br/>
<br/>
We can relate to Preach and Chuck trying to estimate the event stamp <br/>
attendees, the log book we started for this event has only a few <br/>
pages remaining, and our inky pages are filled with the most <br/>
tremendous artistic letterboxing efforts ever released into the <br/>
wild!!  <br/>
<br/>
Near as we can tell, Just from  the MMM we've found 58 of the listed <br/>
boxes, 4 amazing monster HH's, 4 monstrously delightful one day <br/>
boxes,  37 laid back exchanges, 12 crypt-ic PT's (oh and Joan, <br/>
dahhling, we must tawk soon!).  Two cool event stamps.. and a <br/>
partridge in a pear tree.... oops wrong holiday! *grin<br/>
<br/>
So many boxes... three weeks left!<br/>

I hope everyone carries colors with them as some boxes have no ink. <br/>
Looking to get back the weekend of the 30th for some of the rest.<br/>
<br/>
BTW amongst my favorites so far was "The Grim" carved by a 7 year <br/>
old! and Jack Skellington! What fun!<br/>
