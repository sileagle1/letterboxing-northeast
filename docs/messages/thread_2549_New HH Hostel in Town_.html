treated just like any letterbox.  It is just that the box is seeded<br/>

it.  The clue list is a little unusual. Check it out on either LbNA or<br/>
Atlasquest.<br/>

The Lazy Letterboxer and her consort, The Letterboxing Ham, along with<br/>
their buddies Matt and David, known as Nick and Nora Charles when it<br/>
comes to Pink Flamingoes, were first finders.  Congratulations.<br/>
