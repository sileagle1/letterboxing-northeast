getting us into letterboxing!  We started 'boxing this past summer <br/>
and have been having a blast ever since.  Okay, we did complain a <br/>
little bit as our core temperatures began to sink in the wind chill <br/>
last Saturday, and we now have a far greater appreciation for poison <br/>
oak and just how deep the water can get in the Brunswick Commons, <br/>
but, hey -- what's life without a little adventure?  We've really <br/>
enjoyed discovering new places and the great stamps folks have <br/>
created.  We've been carving, too, and will be planting some Maine <br/>
boxes when the weather cooperates, so stay tuned!<br/>

</span></blockquote>Sounds good!  We have one stamp ready, and are planning another for <br/>
the same neck o' the woods.  We were busy 'boxing in southern Maine <br/>
Saturday, getting some "higher education", taking a "bird walk" and <br/>
stopping to smell the "beach rose". Also found a "black sheep" in <br/>
need of a lift and discovered our first "heath" (another was too <br/>
snowy for us, but we'll be back - what a cool place!).  All the <br/>
above were alive and well.<br/>
