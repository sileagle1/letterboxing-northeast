Welcome to a really cool hobby!  It really has enlivenend Diane and my life over the past year!  There are lots of places to go and lots of things to see.  Vacation trips will never be the same, either!  Don't despair of the store-boughten stamp - we used one for the first year, and now we put out personally-carved stamps to either side of our 'team stamp' when we log in.<br/>

Welcome again!<br/>

Being a relative "newbie" myself, I can appreciate your excitement... but considering the vast number of available boxes not to mention the awesome sites to see right here in our backyard, I hardly think I'll ever tire of Letterboxing!!

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-460569850">Thank you all for the warm welcome!  In my spare moments in looking <br/>
into the new world of letterboxing, it appears my family and I are <br/>
right smack in the midst of a LB'ing haven!  I am amazed how many are <br/>
in places i've walked over, but it brings a whole new dimension to a <br/>
familiar place! Brad and I are in Mansfield, and it will keep us <br/>
happily busy in our own backyard alone, indeed!<br/>
<br/>
I went to the Lilly Pad (yes, there is one hidden there too! but we <br/>
are waiting until we are better equipt!) down the road today and got <br/>
some pink speedy-pad to work on ... now waiting for the ispiration <br/>
for trail names and a signature stamp to carve for the P. family.  <br/>
Maybe something to do with Brad's Indian/Ojibwe heritage or our <br/>
mutual love of 'nature' crafts.  <br/>
<br/>
What do other couples do?  Do you have one stamp between the two of <br/>
you?  or do you each have your own stamp?<br/>
<br/>
Again thanks for the welcome<br/>
