with other moderators and Randy Hall (LBNA list owner) about the <br/>
general trends of that list and the trends of membership (i.e. <br/>
preceived, actual, and future trends).  My comment the other day to <br/>
Randy himself was that what we (Heidi and I) see happening is that <br/>
general letterbox chatter, tips, etc seems to be prevalent on the <br/>
letterbox-usa list....while regionally specific posts of new boxes, <br/>
visits, local gathers etc seem to be occupying much of the space on <br/>
these regional talk lists. <br/>
<br/>
No, Its not a bad thing at all...IMO why does someone in Oregon care <br/>
about a new box in CT?  To be honest we went no mail on Lbna some <br/>
time ago and we simply take care of our moderator emails and sift <br/>
through the posts as we have time (or see replies, complaints, etc.). <br/>
We kept LBNE on "daily digest"  and have found much more interest in <br/>
the local happenings, stories, news, sit-reps, etc. I guess it boils <br/>
down to who your target audience is. Something like Mark's post of <br/>
the CT County boxes is not a bad thing to cross post because people <br/>
from other areas might like to try it...but the locals also see the <br/>
post here on LBNE. <br/>
<br/>
Remember that there are no rules. If you see something posted that <br/>
you already read elsewhere, feel free to skip it. <br/>

<br/>
I live in Mid-Atlantic but belong to NE because I have boxed there <br/>
and met new and wonderful friends.  Since I just recently went to <br/>
Denver CO to box - and initiate a new friend to boxing - I signed <br/>
onto the RMLB group site to read their messages -- and learned one <br/>
local box we struggled to find was still there last month, we were <br/>
just to 'confused' to find it.<br/>
<br/>
The point of this is that local news is available to -usa folks <br/>
traveling to a new area by just reading that area's posts.  (Assuming <br/>
all the area lb groups have open posts.)  So there really isn't any <br/>
need to double post - except for Gather Announcements directing folks <br/>
to the particular area LB group that is sponsoring the gather.<br/>
