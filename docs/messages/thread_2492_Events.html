We appreciate the time, talent, good spirit, and kind-heartedness we<br/>
have found within the community. These qualities show at their peak in<br/>
the gatherings and events that we have attended.  The apparent effort<br/>
that has gone into these is tremendous and we owe the folks that have<br/>
put these events on a debt of gratitude.<br/>
<br/>
It would be too easy to leave someone out in listing those for whom we<br/>
have praise because events obviously are not the work of just of few.<br/>
We appreciate them all, the seen and those in the background who give<br/>
of their time and share the load.<br/>
<br/>
So far we have attended Frightnight at the Fort in Kittery, the<br/>
Belfast event, and the Pink Flamingo Caper in Leominster.  They were<br/>
all wonderful. Each was the best for different reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Most of all, I like the contact with the people and am awed by the<br/>
talent of carvers, organizers, and planters. It's Swonderful,<br/>
Mahvalous what you do for us.<br/>

Because of your note and that you took the time a few weeks back to point me to the letterbox basement, I would like to send you a postal letterbox I recently received - it's the Random Acts of Letterboxing Kindness letterbox. If you are interested, all I need is a mailing address.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to run in to you on the trails sometime....<br/>
