Dave and I took a small jaunt to a few letterboxes in New Jersey. I realize that this message might not be totally appropriate for the North East list, but we wanted to let people know that the Battle of Monmouth boxes were in deed all present and accounted for. The first box might be a little damp, but now has a plastic bag for protection. The boxer that adopted the box has been notified and I hope that they remove the part about the missing box. We decided to take a chance and look for both boxes, even though the clue sheet that I had printed up said they were missing.<br/>
Please pass this on to any other lists that might be interested. This park is well worth the visit.<br/>

PS: we also found the SSSSSSSS ! letterbox in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, so we were three for three today!<br/>
