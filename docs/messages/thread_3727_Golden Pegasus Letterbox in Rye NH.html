This is great news. We thought this one was long lost. It hasn't been found in quite sometime.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The problem here is that the clues to this are tacked on to Seacoast 2 by Aisling. Seacoast 2 has been missing for quite sometime and Aisling updated her clue page and removed the clues. Without going into the wayback machine, there is no way to get the starting point. The average boxer doesn't know where to start. I'm not sure you can get the clues in the wayback machine either.<br/>
<br/>
In any case I hope someone who has already found it and knows where it belongs will step up.<br/>

the original spot is no longer available due to widening of the trail. there<br/>
are a few good spots within a 10' radius that would be good. <br/>
<br/>
you are correct in that the town is portsmouth not rye. i can see where a<br/>
person not familiar with the area, coming from rye, would mistake it.<br/>
especially before they built it all up in that area. dang strip malls!<br/>

i have just sent an email to aisling, and if there are no objections from<br/>
her or anyone else, i will arrange with the park to pick up the box. <br/>
