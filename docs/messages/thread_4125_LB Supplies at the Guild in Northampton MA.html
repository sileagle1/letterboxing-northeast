I just wanted to give a shout out to the locally owned arts store in my<br/>
area. The Guild in Northampton MA has a great selection of papers, logbooks,<br/>
inks/pens, carving materials &amp; knives. The staff is kind &amp; goes out of their<br/>
way to help. Just this morning I was in looking for a #1 blade. They didn't<br/>

They have pink stuff in 3 or 4 sizes, and the white staedtler blocks and a few other random kinds of erasers and things.  They have about 3 different brands of blades as well.  They can be pricey, but it's nice to be able to run out and get something nearby.<br/>
