unsuccessfully to find it last August on a VERY hot and muggy day.  We <br/>
finally made it back to Voluntown to finish the Green Falls Pond <br/>
series as well as Mystery Falls.  What a beautiful spot!!!  ToadDog <br/>
loves it there, too!<br/>
I have to add that Sojourner's grizzly surprise recently is MOST <br/>
disturbing.  My first reaction  of UGH!! leads to the obvious question <br/>
of where did it come from and, for heaven's sake, WHY was it in a <br/>
letterbox?  Our biggest surprise today was two fairly large(4 Ft.) <br/>
blacksnakes that were sunning themselves on top of the shelter near <br/>
the Mystery Falls box.  Swamp Yankee LOVES snakes and couldn't resist <br/>
trying to make friends with one, but he/she wouldn't have it!!!<br/>
