I am looking for some help. Dave and I went and did about about 7 of the days of Christmas series and now I can't find our clue sheets. It's been deleted from the LBNA site. Does anyone still have theirs? Would you mind photocopying them for me? Besides our log book, I keep a photo album with pictures of our hunting and the towns we visit.I would like to include the clues with the photo's. <br/>
