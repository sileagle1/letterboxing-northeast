first, and believe we were in the correct area, but no box.....  Has anyone <br/>
found this box lately?<br/>
<br/>
We then went out to Castle Hill and checked on the Castle Hill Light box, <br/>
which is in ok shape.  I unfortunately forgot a new ink pad for it, but was able <br/>
to use the one in the box to stamp into PSU Fan's book.  The weather was <br/>
beautiful but the wind was really whipping around the point!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Then we decided to hit Fort Adams, and found the correct wall, but no box.  <br/>
On our way back down the hill, we found a dirty square Rubbermaid lid, which we <br/>
think could have been part of the box.  We fear that it has been trashed.  We <br/>
realize that someone may have been there in Oct. 2004 (seeing that there's a <br/>
note on the Drew website concerning bringing ziplocks etc...).  Has anyone <br/>
found it more recently?<br/>
<br/>
At least PSU Fan was 1 for 3 on the day, and I got to do some shopping at <br/>
Dansk (they're having a store closing sale, BTW... for those interested) for <br/>
Christmas.  It's too bad that I didn't get a box too!<br/>

I found Land Sailing Newport on September 21.  When I found it, it was<br/>
REALLY well hidden in the hiding spot.  It was so well hidden that I<br/>
almost gave up on it because I had an appointment in Newport, but I<br/>
finally found it.<br/>
<br/>
.<br/>

I went to Fort Adams a few weeks ago and replaced Ziplocs and put a new<br/>
logbook in the box for the Drew Clan.  When I found the box it was not<br/>
in the wall-it was on the hill under some rocks, so I replaced the box<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope that this helps.  Since I live in the area I can go check these<br/>
boxes in the next few days for the Drew Clan to see if they are still<br/>
there.  I hope the boxes have survived they are some oldies with great<br/>
stamps!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Today I checked on the two Newport RI letterboxes that Music Woman<br/>
couldn't find.  The Fort Adams letterbox does appear to be missing.  I<br/>
replaced a log book in this box for the Drew Family a few weeks ago and<br/>
the rocks that I had placed on the box to cover it were moved about.  I<br/>
also looked around the nearby area and could not find the box or any<br/>
remnants of the box.  On a happier note, the Fast Passage letterbox at<br/>
Breton Point is still in its hiding spot and has had a few visits in the<br/>
months since I found it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing!<br/>
