                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1283511371">I know and have worked with several nature center directors in the <br/>
Connecticut area for many years.  All have been supporters of <br/>
letterboxing when I explain the hobby to them.  One of them is <br/>
planning to put out his own series of boxes in his park to get the <br/>
activity going there.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of them have mentioned to me that boxes have been placed in <br/>
their parks without their permission being asked.  They feel this is <br/>
impolite at best.<br/>
<br/>
Folks, we can't afford to generate any bad feelings for our hobby.  <br/>
We depend on the good will and openness of the parks and directors <br/>
for our hobby to flourish.  They can be our biggest supporters.  <br/>
Many directors have integrated letterboxing into their center <br/>
programs, planted their own, taught it as an activity in their <br/>
classes.  As is human nature, they will be sharing their experiences <br/>
with other directors at other centers.  We want them to be sharing <br/>
good experiences.  This is one of the most important ways for the <br/>
good news of letterboxing to be spread.<br/>
<br/>
I know there have been stories of placers who have been called to <br/>
dance on the carpet, and not all have been well received.  I know it <br/>
is risky to talk with "management" or "the authorities".  But these <br/>
people are directors because they like out of doors activities just <br/>
like us.  They can be part of our community.<br/>
<br/>
Please, if you have not done so, go to your local park or nature <br/>
center director and tell them about letterboxing and the boxes you <br/>
have planted.  If need be, say that you thought it is harmless and <br/>
you didn't know what their reaction would be.  We need these people <br/>
on our side.  If they give a negative response, pull your boxes.  We <br/>
don't want to be in an area where we are not wanted.  There will be <br/>
other areas where we will be welcomed.<br/>
