<br/>
We're planning to head east in mid-September.  We'll be flying into <br/>
Hartford, CT for a 4-day weekend, including some time in Groton.<br/>
<br/>
We know there are a kazillion boxes in CT, so are looking for some <br/>
recommendations.  We prefer to do some longer hikes with boxes along <br/>
the way, rather than many quick stops.  Can any of you make some <br/>
recommendations for this area of CT?  Specific parks or areas, or <br/>
specific boxers who tend to plant on longer hikes?  (We prefer to find <br/>
hand carved stamps.)<br/>
<br/>
If you have the time to give us some advice, you can email me off-line.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
