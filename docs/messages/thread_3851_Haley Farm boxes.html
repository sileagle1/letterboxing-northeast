                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-927446042">I visited Haley Farm in Groton, CT today with a camp  group.  This was their <br/>
first time letterboxing (for many) and they were  really excited.  Sadly, the <br/>
2 box series, The Cemetery and Picnic Rock, was  in terrible shape and should <br/>
really be completely redone or removed.  The  1st box was just where it should <br/>
be, but the box was broken in many places and  the contents were soaking wet <br/>
and filthy.  The stamp was broken into 2  pieces.  I wished that I had brought <br/>
some supplies with me to repair it,  but really everything needs to be <br/>
replaced.  The second box has a really  neat spot and container, but sadly it has <br/>
been overtaken by geocachers.   There is a nearby cache that is supposed to be <br/>
hidden within 50 feet of the  letterbox, so I am guessing that many people see <br/>
this 1st and assume it is what  they are looking for.  The mailbox was full of <br/>
loose papers and trinkets,  but the stamp was nowhere to be found.  The kids <br/>
were pretty hot and  getting tired by this point and were very disappointed <br/>
when they couldn't stamp  their books.  I assumed since the series had been <br/>
found in May, that it  would be good to find, but really it needs serious <br/>
maintenance.  Didn't see  a contact placer link for this box, so if anyone out there <br/>
knows how to contact  Karen, please let her know the poor condition of her <br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
On a happier note, we did successfully locate the Drew Clan's  Canopy Rock <br/>
box.  Someone added a replacement log book a while back and the  stamp, book and <br/>
box were all in very good condition.  Thanks for ending our  day on a high <br/>
note!!<br/>
