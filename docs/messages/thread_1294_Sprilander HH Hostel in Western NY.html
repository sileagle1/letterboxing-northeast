regular travellers as well as postal ones. If you're interested in <br/>
moving your HH our of YOUR little circle of letterboxers, send us an <br/>
e-mail and we'll send you our address. As we get them, we'll move <br/>
them on. It's also a normal letterbox, so we'll post the clues as <br/>
soon as we set the container out this weekend.<br/>

When I said postal letterboxes, I meant you can mail us any <br/>
hitchhiker you want and we'll either place it here in Western NY via <br/>
the hostel, or mail it to another state, like postal HH's do. I only <br/>
recently realized that normal postal HH's ONLY travel through the <br/>
mail, so if you mail us one, make sure you let us know if it's MEANT <br/>
to stay postal or should go into regular letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, where do we sign up to get on a postal HH list? We'd really like <br/>
to try it!<br/>
