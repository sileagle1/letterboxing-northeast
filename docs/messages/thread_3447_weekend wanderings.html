We were on the path to put something in the Rome box when we ran across Warrior Woman and Brother Bear also out doing maintenance! In fact they got an earlier start and did most of our work for us! Wow, you guys rock! They had found the boxes out 'sunning' themselves on the stone walls and made sure each and every one of the was tucked in nice and snug.So, Great Job guys! A+.<br/>
We also got to finish the Pirates of the Caribbean Series and did maintenance on Island Sanctuary. It now has a new logbook for the season. For a box that's in a dry location it seems to pick up alot of moisture.?<br/>
We are planning on replanting Conanicut Canons as soon as we can be sure we can keep the site to ourselves. We will post when it's back in service.<br/>
Good luck to all you Spring'boxers,<br/>

Oh -<br/>

I was just doing what I always do when I go out and box - if I see <br/>
something amiss, or if a new baggie or two (or a whole new set of <br/>
EVERYTHING is needed, a la Barbarians at the Gate), I just "do it".  <br/>
And it looks like my leading by example is working, too.  My son, <br/>
Brother Bear, age 9, was *horrified* at what we found with the Rome <br/>
series.  He almost forget to stamp into a few boxes because he was more <br/>
intent on fixing the boxes!<br/>
