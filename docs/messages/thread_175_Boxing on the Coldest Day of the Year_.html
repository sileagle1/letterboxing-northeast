we nuts or what???  I suppose there was SOME reason why we both had the day <br/>
off from school today!<br/>
<br/>
We had a great time finding the following boxes: Special Joy's, The Robin, In <br/>
Search of the White Horse of Uffington, In Search of the Exmoor Beast.  White <br/>
Horse has a totally holy lid and needs a new ink pad.  An animal has seemed <br/>
to have chewed it and has put holes in the lid.<br/>
<br/>
We then ventured out to Glastonbury to the Audubon Society, only to find that <br/>
we couldn't get half of the clue to the third box due to ice.  For those of <br/>
you who want to get the third box, you have to go to boxes one and two, even if <br/>
you have already found them to get the password.  Even though the trail to <br/>
the second box was impassible, they still wouldn't budge on letting us have the <br/>
box.  Bird Stamper has trained them well.....GRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
We ventured on to get the Town Line, Rapallo Viaduct, and Dead and Dreaming <br/>
boxes, which Bluebird was missing.  It was nice to get out to Town Line and <br/>
Rapallo to check the boxes!  All boxes are in fine shape!  I'm wondering if I <br/>
should use those cheapo boxes more often!  They seem to work great!<br/>
<br/>
Hope others got out boxing!  Have a boxious three, four or five day weekend <br/>
(depending on where you teach in CT!)!!!!!<br/>

Don't read another sentence, because it will only annoy you and make <br/>
you hate me.  And it'll waste your time.  Really.  This is not a <br/>
joke.  Just go to the next message and save yourself the agony of <br/>
finishing this one.<br/>
<br/>
You realize, "Boxing on the coldest day of the year" doesn't sound <br/>
quite as amazing when the year only has 16 days to it so far.  When <br/>
I went letterboxing on January 2nd, it was the coldest day of the <br/>
year, but you didn't see me bragging about it!  =)<br/>
<br/>
And then, what if--for example--on December 28th this year, the <br/>
temperature drops pricariously to record lows.  In that case, your <br/>
assertion about "Boxing on the coldest day of the year" would be <br/>
dead wrong!  Naturally, we assume you mean "Boxing on the coldest <br/>
day of the year.... so far."  But you know what they say about <br/>
assumptions: They make an ASS out of U and ME.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for for ignoring this very off topic post....  <br/>

And do you realize that for us CT boxers, that Jan 2nd was not in fact the <br/>
coldest day of the year, thus far, and neither was Dec. 28th.  (I was out boxing <br/>
both of those days)  So I guess everything is subjective.  As for it being <br/>
the coldest day of the year... OK... you're right about the "thus far" comment, <br/>
however, considering that most of the state had the day off from school due to <br/>
temperatures ranging from -10 to -5 degrees this morning, I'd say that we <br/>
have probably seen the coldest day of the year.<br/>

Oh, giggle , you made my day !! Having found that box , I was able to <br/>
'follow ' you  in my mind's eye and know the very trees you must have <br/>
been digging around.!! I did too, only there was no snow. Also my hair <br/>
is not red nor is it long, but I often look as wild as you felt.!! <br/>
 happy days !! and thanks for the fun report.<br/>
