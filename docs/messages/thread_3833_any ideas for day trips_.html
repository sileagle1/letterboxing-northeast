used to live in Manchester this was one of our favorite spots. Our son's<br/>
first outing (when he was about a week old) was to be shown off at Shady<br/>
Glen (plus Mom was craving one of those amazing cheeseburgers!) Son is now<br/>
22 so that was a lonnnnnng time ago.<br/>
Do tell!!<br/>
<br/>
As for daytrips, depending on the age of your children, how about Purgatory<br/>
Chasm in Sutton, MA? Or do some of the railtrail boxes. You get a bike ride<br/>
and a box, two for the price of one...<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

Yarmouth has more,  I would guess.   We have planted, but not yet posted, a series in Foxboro, MA, which is kid-friendly.  There are ten boxes planted in the state forest now, and we're planting ten more on the other side.  Then we have other series planted in Foxboro, although we'll be retiring it soon.  There's also High Rock series in the same forest, but from another side, planted by Sagacorn.  You can keep an eye out for that.  There's Gloucester, MA; you can visit Rockport while you're<br/>
 taking a break from boxing.  There's lots of great spots but these are just a few of our favorite areas!<br/>

Lowell, plus I hear there's a letterbox near the train.  <br/>
