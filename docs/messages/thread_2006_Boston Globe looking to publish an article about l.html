<br/>
I just wanted to give you a heads up that the Boston Globe, MetroWest <br/>
Edition is looking to publish an article about letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I received a direct email from the correspondent and spent quite a <br/>
bit of time on the phone with him discussing the nature of our <br/>
underground hobby.<br/>
<br/>
I will be speaking with him again.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to let you all know just what I am saying.  I am discussing <br/>
the origins of letterboxing, the trends that I have seen over the <br/>
last five years, the "underground" nature of letterboxing, and our <br/>
respect of the environment.<br/>
<br/>
I also begged him *not* to write and publish the article - half <br/>
joking and half serious ;-)<br/>
<br/>
With five years of letterboxing experience under my belt, I am hoping <br/>
to provide him with correctly balanced information that will <br/>
ultimately result in a positive bit of toned-down publicity.<br/>
<br/>
Wish me luck!<br/>

pass on... The number of letterboxes in Eastern <br/>
Massachusetts that are registered on letterboxing.org has <br/>
increased 100% in the last 12 months.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Alright flame me if you will, but it sounds to me like another "ploy"<br/>
by the liberal media to promote values such as respect for the<br/>
enviroment, respect for other people, respect for history, and respect<br/>
for the arts.<br/>
Do we really want people to be creative and free-thinking? Isn't that<br/>
bad for business? Maybe someone should call the "Herald"!<br/>
