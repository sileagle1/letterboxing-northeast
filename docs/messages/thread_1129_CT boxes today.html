(especially since my son just got over a nasty case of poison ivy)  The kids weren't up to it that day.  Beatiful trails at that park!  The kids played on the bridge and my son tried to catch a few frogs.<br/>
<br/>
How does one get their hands on these unpublished mystery clues?  This letterboxing has so many facets to it!  <br/>
<br/>
My 2 year old daughter cracked me up on Saturday.  While walking along the trail she came to a large rock on the side of the trail and stopped and said, "Box mommmy!"  while trying to lift the rock (which was almost as big as she was).  I told her that the directions said to keep going, but she was mad, insisting there should be a box under that rock!  Maybe I'll have her pick the spot for our first plant!<br/>
