4 of the 5 missing East End sereis were replaced....<br/>
<br/>
#4 - Forest City (new clue change)<br/>
COURT HOUSE - facing the park<br/>
2nd gate take a right<br/>
3rd of 8 out of sight<br/>
<br/>
#7 - Public Library - replaced in the same spot<br/>
with a triangular rock - really wedged in there this time.<br/>
No composting taking place anymore!!<br/>
<br/>
#8 - MECA - replaced in the same spot<br/>
Right inside the brick atrium in front of D'Angelo's sub shop.<br/>
There's a nook that is perfect inside this brick. Make sure not to leave the box back in <br/>
the mulch or it will be seen and go missing. Thanks! <br/>
<br/>
#9 - PMA - replaced same spot<br/>
This really needs a black film canister in hindsight - oh well.<br/>
I highly recommend doing this in the evening.<br/>
<br/>
I replaced all the portland boxes at night. It was great because Congress Street is still <br/>
vivid (in many respects) the cops are really too busy arresting the local drunks and <br/>
hooligans to notice your behavior. I wouldn't go it alone, but I would say that we had <br/>
a blast replacing these at night.<br/>
<br/>
Also finally placed 2 boxes. Clues forthcoming.<br/>
<br/>
Bangor Folk Festival now resides in a fixed location downtown - in Bangor and awaits <br/>
a finder with a hitchhiker prize.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy! <br/>
