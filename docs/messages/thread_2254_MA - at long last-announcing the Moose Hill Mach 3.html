This event will take place on Sunday, August 21, 2005 beginning at <br/>
12 noon and lasting until round about 5 p.m. or so. Our past two <br/>
have been great fun and this year should be no different.<br/>
<br/>
There are several permanent boxes on the sanctuary and many more <br/>
within close proximity at nearby parks. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the generous folks at the sanctuary (doing me a favor yet <br/>
again, since I no longer work there), we will be allowed to use the <br/>
canopies and picnic tables in the field adjacent to the nature <br/>
center and parking lot. (I hope folks will consider a small donation <br/>
to the sanctuary as a way to say "thank you" for this courtesy.)<br/>
<br/>
A few items of note:<br/>
The restrooms are in the nature center, which closes at 5 p.m.<br/>
Alas, as always, dogs are not allowed on the sanctuary.<br/>
Smoking and alcohol are also not permitted. (The town of Sharon has <br/>
a no public smoking statute)<br/>
We will have a hitchhiker hostel and will observe strict "bring one <br/>
to take one" rule as well as "no double, triple etc dipping" to <br/>
prevent the over-exploitation of hitchhikers.<br/>
CSCM and I will be hosting and will provide cold drinks and we <br/>
welcome folks to bring their favorite dish.<br/>
<br/>
I will carve an event stamp but certainly welcome any other event <br/>
stamps or traveling event stamps to join us that day. <br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions, comments <br/>
or concerns....or if you'd like to RSVP.<br/>
We hope you'll be able to join us on this relatively short notice.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>

total of 36 finds (including one hitchhiker), a new personal best for <br/>
each of us. We hiked about 11 miles through Gillette Castle and <br/>
Devil's Hopyard State Parks, and here's what we found:<br/>
<br/>
Sherlock Holmes #1-2<br/>
African Queen<br/>
As You Wish #1-5<br/>
Use Your Imagination #1-4<br/>
The Grinch in Connecticut<br/>
Eagle at the Lone Wolf Tree<br/>
Hopbox<br/>
Devil in the Hopyard<br/>
Devil's Hopyard #1<br/>
Waterfalls Two<br/>
Curious George and the Giant's Chair<br/>
A Series of Unfortunate Letterboxes #1-12<br/>
Flower Drum Song #2-3<br/>
<br/>
Birthday Cake in Devil's Hopyard has been pulled, which we didn't <br/>
know, so we couldn't find that one. We did find the Happy Hitchhiker <br/>
and two bonus boxes which brought our day's total to 36.<br/>
<br/>
We replaced baggies when needed (until we ran out!), but most <br/>
everything was in good shape.<br/>
<br/>
We also replaced Devil's Hopyard #2 with a new box, stamp and log <br/>
(with the permission of Jay Drew), and refreshed #1 with a new log book.<br/>
<br/>
Funny incident at the end of the day -- as we were pulling in to <br/>
Flower Drum Song #2, a van pulled in behind us, and Clueless thought <br/>
for sure they were following us. Turns out they were -- it was North <br/>
Star and Kreepi Kelli! We found Flower Drum Song #2 together and <br/>
exchanged new personal stamps and tips and inside info. Quite a fun <br/>
chance meeting!<br/>
