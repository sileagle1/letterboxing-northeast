recently. It was definitely there when I visited in August, but I<br/>
don't doubt that it's gone now. I've made a note in the clues, and<br/>
won't be replacing it since it was an orphan box anyway. If anyone<br/>

I'm glad to report that my Shooting Star box, also in Rockport but<br/>
requiring more of an effort to find, was reported to be in great shape<br/>
as of last week.<br/>

I don't know about more recently, but Bull Frog Pond was in place as of <br/>
9-4-04 when we stamped in.  We actually found the MA Stamp Catcher HH in <br/>
there as well and moved it on.  Shooting Star was also a nice location.<br/>
<br/>
Hope all finds you in good hunting,<br/>
