Mountain state park and meet me up at the pavillion near the tower. <br/>
Chances are you'll be headed that way anyhow. The halloween trail will <br/>
make it's debut on the metacomet trail that works it's way up the <br/>
mountain and intersects with with the tower trail. 13 spooky creations <br/>
will haunt your journey up to the top where you'll find me under the <br/>
pavillion waiting for you with an event stamp and clues to at LEAST 5 <br/>
new boxes in the park. This will be my first shot at a gathering, so <br/>
bear with me. Hope to see you there!<br/>
