                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-490151769">Thanks to everyone who contacted me about my quick trip to CT! I am <br/>
happily ensconced in a lovely hotel room in Avon, and am celebrating my <br/>
recent hiring by The Hartford. <br/>
<br/>
No, no..not the one in CT. Although I will be working out of the <br/>
Syracuse office, I will be visiting the home office here in CT from <br/>
time to time. I will still be involved in the film fest at home, and <br/>
will stil be found working at the games in the Carrier Dome...so come <br/>
see me!  I am doubly encouraged to visit CT though as I have found <br/>
lovely boxes here so far.  You really CAN trip over boxes in CT!!<br/>
<br/>
I have my trail maps ready for Talcott Mountain, clue sheets printed up <br/>
and some mystery boxes solved, and have received some enthusiastic  <br/>
recommendations from the locals here. Wow. After boxing here in CT, <br/>
Central New York is going to feel like a return trip to the moon! *wink*<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, I really do appreciate all the help and advice. Kreepy <br/>
Kelli tracked me down, she's bringing along a couple of others and we <br/>
have emergency rides if we get stuck. Thank you thank you thank you for <br/>
all your kindness and hospitality!<br/>
