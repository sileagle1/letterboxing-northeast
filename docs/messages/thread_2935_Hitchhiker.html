it by all means log it/stamp-in, and leave it for another.  If you <br/>
decide to take it, (and this may take some time to do) find a suitable--<br/>
i.e. big enough, 'box in which to leave it.  If it won't fit easily in <br/>
a 'box, please don't leave it.  I've found a couple of drowned HH's and <br/>
one caused damage to the LB it was shoe-horned into...<br/>
I've taken some and left others where/when I found them.  <br/>

So now that you have taken the HH with you, log it into your logbook adn plan on planting it when you head out boxing again. when you place the HH in a new box, you will need to stamp the Letterbox stamp into the HH logbook just as you did with your personal stamp, and the HH stamp into the new host Letterbox the HH will now stay in. after that, the HH will be taken by someone else who finds that box after you.<br/>

  i hope that this was a good enough explanation this time.<br/>

It is always very easy to make errors with hitchhikers, but <br/>
especially when you are tired, it is raining &amp; you have logbooks &amp; <br/>
stamps scattered all over the place.<br/>
<br/>
Picking Up a Hitchhiker<br/>
<br/>
1.	Prior to picking up a hitchhiker (HH) be sure you will be <br/>
able to get it to a letterbox within a reasonable amount of time <br/>
(varies), usually within about one week.<br/>
2.	Check the hitchhiker carefully for movement restrictions.  Is <br/>
it limited to one state, one town, or maybe to one park, or just to <br/>
Scouts etc. etc.?  Be certain you can comply with the owner's <br/>
wishes.  Some owners require that the hitchhiker be moved within 24 <br/>
hours etc.  Some HH's are marked "No Gathers."<br/>
3.	Be sure the stamp &amp; logbook are present.  Check the box &amp; the <br/>
ground if the stamp is missing.  If you take a broken hitchhiker you <br/>
should be willing to contact the owner &amp; try to help.<br/>
4.	Verify that the hitchhiker was stamped into the letterbox <br/>
logbook correctly.  If not, you should stamp it in (see below).  If <br/>
necessary, stamp the letterbox into the HH (see below).<br/>
5.	Ready to take the hitchhiker?  If yes, record in the <br/>
letterbox log that you have taken the hitchhiker, this is very <br/>
important.  Some people stamp the HH into their log now, some wait <br/>
until they get home (don't forget!).  Reassemble the HH and take it.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dropping off a Hitchhiker<br/>
<br/>
1.	Find a letterbox that meets the requirements of the HH, <br/>
sign/stamp into it, and stamp the HH into the letterbox logbook.<br/>
2.	Stamp the letterbox stamp into the HH.<br/>
3.	Record that you left the hitchhiker.  Double check that the <br/>
HH still has its stamp &amp; log sealed into its own container; drop it <br/>
off.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is really pretty easy.  Mistakes are made all the time, but most <br/>
of them are easily fixed.<br/>
