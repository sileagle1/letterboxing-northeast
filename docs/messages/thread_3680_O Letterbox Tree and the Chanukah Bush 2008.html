<br/>
The possibility of ocean-effect snow flurries are showing up in our<br/>
local weather forecasts, a sure sign that the time has come to think<br/>
about O Letterbox Tree &amp; the Chanukah Bush once again. We decided to<br/>
give this year's series a theme, a way of getting to know each other<br/>
better: holiday traditions from our families or heritage. We will have<br/>
both our letterboxing Christmas tree decorated and our Chanukah bush<br/>
under the light-up dreidel and menorah ready on the weekend after<br/>
Thanksgiving. <br/>
<br/>
From then through December 10th, we will gratefully accept<br/>
contributions of stamps from those who want to celebrate with our<br/>
corner of the country. Archimedes' Screw and I will supply a decorated<br/>
ornament/box in which we will hide your stamp. You do not need to make<br/>
a logbook. We will ask each finder to log in on cardstock which I will<br/>
scan and return to you in full color with your stamp. <br/>
<br/>
If you live locally and wish to make your own container for your stamp<br/>
and put it on the tree yourself, it will be ready and waiting for you<br/>
from November 24th through December 10th. We will post the clues as a<br/>
series on the evening of December 10th. At that point we will consider<br/>
the series complete so visitors don't feel that they have to wait<br/>
until January 1st to come to the tree in order to collect them all.<br/>
For those who wish to contribute after that date, a hitchhiker,<br/>
perhaps one with a note asking it to remain with the tree until<br/>
January 1st, would be a delightful addition. We ask you to post the<br/>
hitchhiker on your own wherever you want and we will send them on<br/>
their way either in boxes we find during our winter boxing or with the<br/>
stamps and copies of the log that we return to the generous contributors.<br/>
<br/>
We will retire the tree on the morning of January 2nd and give our<br/>
neighbors a break from letterboxing, (at least for a few months.)<br/>
Stamps should be mailed to:<br/>

Thank you in advance from the holiday revelers in the Northeast!<br/>
