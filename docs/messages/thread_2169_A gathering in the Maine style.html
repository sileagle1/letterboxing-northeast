September (in my "from away") opinion, is the best time of year in<br/>
Maine because it's the only time when the cold waters of the gulf of<br/>
maine warm up enough to swim. It's also the best time for hiking and<br/>
exploring coastal areas devoid of touristas aka people "from away"!!<br/>

True mud season only really exists in Vermont based on my experience.<br/>
Many of their back roads are still dirt and literally turn to mud.<br/>
Folks either vacate their homes or stay put until it's dried up.<br/>
Things may have changed since global warming persists.<br/>
