I launched a HH at the MMM, and realized I forgot to put the explination in the baggie.  The Hitchiker is named The Dusty Stubby Spotted Dick Award.<br/>
<br/>
Now relax your knickers a sec.. A Spotted Dick is a dessert served throughout England.  Granted it's an inside joke for a few, but please read below for a little clarity.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is offended by the use of the word dick in this context, please let me know and I'll have the hitchiker pulled.<br/>

We just tackled the origin of "Dick" as a nickname and a few other usages--a riding whip, an apron, abbreviation for "dictionary," a policeman, a declaration, and (of course), a part of the male anatomy. <br/>
With all these varied usages, you got a problem with "dick" being also derived from "pudding"? My sources all pretty much agree with the derivation, without being specific how. However, I can see "pudding" become "puddink" becoming "puddick" and then just "dick." <br/>
<br/>
The word "dick" has appeared in any number of strange places. Around the 1840s, "dick" was used to mean a type of hard cheese; when treacle sauce was added, it became "treacle dick", and finally when currants or raisins were added (looking like little spots), the "spotted dick" was born. <br/>
<br/>
The earliest recipes for spotted dick are from 1847. For non-British readers, "spotted dick" is a boiled suet pudding, with bits of dried fruit (usually raisins or currants) that (as already noted) look like little spots. <br/>
<br/>
The Oxford Companion to Food comments that, strictly speaking, "spotted dick" is made by taking a flat sheet, spreading sugar and raisins on it, then rolling it up. A similar dessert is "spotted dog," a plain cylinder of suet paste with the raisins and currants and sugar stuck into it, so that the spots are visible on the outside. Both spotted dick and spotted dog were traditionally boiled (or even steamed) in a cloth, but nowadays they are usually baked. <br/>
<br/>
The dessert is slightly different in Ireland. In Ireland in the late 1800s, the tradition of yeast-bread manufacture was not strong, so most breads were raised with bicarbonate of soda and an acid, rather than with yeast, and thus called soda breads. Thus, the spotted dick in Ireland is sweet soda bread, with sugar, currants, and raisins, and it's also called the spotted dog or railway cake. <br/>

<br/>
I can't get into it on this family-oriented talk list but suffice it to say The Baker's Dozen had quite a time with this dessert's name one night in the pub at Langstone Manor! We'll leave it at that.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you that have read our trip commentary on our website, this is one of the reasons why I thought we might have done some damage to US/UK relations and probably the main reason for Andy's continuous red face during dinner that night. <br/>
<br/>
Alexis - you forgot to let everyone know the first recipient of this award!!<br/>
;-)<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!! <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-814213453">I think Mark is referring to gentleman (and I use the term loosely) who serves as the barkeep of the pub at the Higher Longoford Caravan Park.  Said barkeep took offence to to 13 D*** Yankees ...my interpretation of his words... well they weren't actually words now that I think about it..... he did a great deal of sputtering in his righteous indignation) stomping in (not!) without having phoned in reservations to his fine and most quaint establishment.  He did, most graciously offer to serve us out of doors at 8 o'click at night and bring the letterboxes contained therein out to us.  Forgive if me if I forgot to mention the joint was jumping with a whopping 1 patron at the time.<br/>
<br/>
If this didn't bruise our delicate egos enough, he managed to throw us out  AGAIN the following night when we sent Mark in to apologize for the previous evenings intrusion.  He just wan't trying to hear it!  Fortunately, when you're from the east coast, you never learned as a kid to have a delicate ego.  We moved on to other diggs and had a roaring good time in the car on the way.  <br/>
<br/>
I was going to go back the third night to really dig it in, but I was afraid he might burst a blood vessel and keel over... now how would Box Hound explain to the Baby Bandits that I was in the town gaol, and couldn't come home just yet???<br/>
