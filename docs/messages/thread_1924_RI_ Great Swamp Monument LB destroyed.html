what was left of it) was in my front door. A critter had chewed off a<br/>
corner of the stamp and the log book was soaked through:( This was the<br/>
first letterbox that I put out back in January of 2002. Lots of cool<br/>
old sigs in there. Lots lost to the H2O. Not sure about when I'll get<br/>
around to replacing it. 3 years is a pretty good run.<br/>

Special thanks to Warrior Woman, who rescued it and got it back to me.<br/>

boxes today.<br/>
<br/>
We started out with Laurette's Coffee Break in Wakefield, RI...<br/>
<br/>
...found the location...even found a piece of inked paper towel...but<br/>
no letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Then we went to the South County Bike Path near the train<br/>
station...found the location, no rocks!<br/>
<br/>
We then went to Great Swamp...and despite no LB a third time, it was a<br/>
great walk, great place to explore and cool history about the place.<br/>
<br/>
FINALLY! We found the Warrior Woman Jukebox 7 - Three Dog Night LB in<br/>
NK, RI...<br/>
<br/>
Buddy...<br/>
<br/>
Great Hiking Day, and just a great day to get out!<br/>
