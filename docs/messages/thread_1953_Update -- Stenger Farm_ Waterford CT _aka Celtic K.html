for this 4 box series.... a 2nd box in the series has been vandalized <br/>
and I have to pick it up from a teacher at Clark Lane Middle School <br/>
this week. That leaves only 2 of 4 in place still as one disappeared <br/>
last year. <br/>
<br/>
It is not yet clear if we will be retiring the remaining 2 or if we <br/>
will recarve and re-tool the series. <br/>
<br/>
More to come in the following weeks.<br/>
<br/>
If you look around, you can find a copy of the clues online, though NOT <br/>
on letterboxing.org or atlasquest. (cough hint hint cough) <br/>
