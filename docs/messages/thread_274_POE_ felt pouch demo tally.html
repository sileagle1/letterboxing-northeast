<br/>
I'd like a final tally on how many folks are interested in the felt<br/>
pouch demonstration that I will be doing on Sunday. Please respond to<br/>
me through email not on the list.<br/>
<br/>
Again, the felt pouches are very easy to make, a simple stitch and<br/>
because there are so many people attending the POE gathering I will be<br/>
putting together little "kits" so to speak that even people who don't<br/>
have time to see a demo may pick up for a small donation.<br/>
<br/>
The kit will include:<br/>
trimmed felt piece<br/>
button<br/>
sewing thread<br/>
instructions<br/>
<br/>
For anyone who won't be able to attend this gathering I'll be happy to<br/>
bring my demonstration for the Maine Gathering in March.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know - Thanks!<br/>
