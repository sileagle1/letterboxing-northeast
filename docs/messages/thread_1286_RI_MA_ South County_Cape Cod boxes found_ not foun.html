Kingstown, RI, on the 11th. We found the following in place, intact,<br/>
and dry:<br/>
<br/>
Great Gathering<br/>
Inn of the End<br/>
Little Red Schoolhouse<br/>
Nurse Log<br/>
<br/>
Hike On! HH was found with Nurse Log.<br/>
<br/>
We did not find the following:<br/>
<br/>
Trustom Pond #1<br/>
Trustom Pond #2<br/>
<br/>
That night we remembered that we'd had the LBNA 100 PLB since the<br/>
Moose Hill Mach 2 gathering. We've finally stamped into it and will be<br/>
sending it on its way soon.<br/>
<br/>
I was on the Cape for my company's annual snoozefes... er, staff<br/>
retreat on the 13th and 14th and found the following boxes in place,<br/>
intact, and dry, unless otherwise noted:<br/>
<br/>
Cape Cod Life Savers<br/>
The Triker (sign gone, but box is findable)<br/>
Fort Hill (log very full!)<br/>
Lady Slipper (stamp is broken in half)<br/>
Winged Deaths Head<br/>
The Empty Tomb.<br/>
<br/>
I did not find the following:<br/>
<br/>
Chatham Rooster 2<br/>
Tot Toter<br/>
Wind Power<br/>
<br/>
At one of these boxes, the Kissy Kissy HH, carved by RTRW, was released.<br/>
