this Saturday.  This is just a little "mini-gathering" but thought it <br/>
would be nice to have a stamp for this event.  So all those who don't <br/>
have 500 finds will have an event stamp and myself and Lenny are <br/>
working on a letterbox for Saturday.  We hope to see many of our <br/>
letterboxing friends Saturday.  This is what Mark Pepe wrote on his <br/>
site about the F500 stamp.  He has a great web page and I encourge <br/>
all to visit it at  <br/>

(A little plugging of my friends web-site never hurts)<br/>

"Don't forget about the F-500 stamp "parking lot gathering" at Kathy <br/>
John's Restaurant in Storrs, CT this Saturday, December 13 between <br/>
10am and noon. Look for Teach &amp; Preach, who are transporting this <br/>
ScoutDog's stamp for all to use. Even if you have not reached the F-<br/>
500 mark, ScoutDog's encourages you to stamp it and count as an <br/>
exchange! Also, per Preach's most recent post to the new Northeast <br/>
talk list, Lenny of NeeDeeps is carving a special stamp for that day. <br/>
Two letterboxes and exchanges - it all seems worth the drive! See you <br/>
all there on Saturday!"<br/>
