Kingston, NY. On Friday, we took my niece (Horse Girl) and nephew (Sox<br/>
Fan in NY) out for some Ulster County boxing.<br/>
<br/>
Boxin' on the Hudson: The first two boxes were in place, intact, and<br/>
dry. The last box was not found.<br/>
<br/>
Next we met up with Phynstar to tackle a 10-box unpublished series.<br/>
All were found in place, intact, and dry. <br/>
<br/>
Old Matt's Cabin: Found in place, intact, and dry.<br/>
<br/>
Seamon Park: Both boxes found in place, intact, and dry. The Tiny<br/>
Tulip HH was found in the second box.<br/>
<br/>
On our way back home on Saturday, Rustypuff and I tried a couple in<br/>
Winsted, CT.<br/>
<br/>
Winsted Crawdad was not found.<br/>
<br/>
Winchester Soldiers Monument: Both boxes found in place, intact, and dry.<br/>
<br/>
The Touring Turtle HH was dropped off in one of the above boxes.<br/>
<br/>
The Hike On! HH was passed on to Phynstar.<br/>
