wonderful job at this gathering as did everyone else who helped.  The <br/>
entire weekend was planned perfectly (I think the two of them could <br/>
really make a killing at professional event planning - Could be a career <br/>
change?). <br/>
<br/>
It was our first event and everyone was wonderful.  It was great to meet <br/>
and box with such great people.<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait until the next one.  Kudos!<br/>
