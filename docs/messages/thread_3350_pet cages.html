  I have 2 pet bunnies and they are the cutiest,vader and hermione, <br/>
but they keep getting bigger and bigger...but now that we think they <br/>
are done growing we have bought them MEGA cage. Because we have kept <br/>
upgrading their cages I now have 4 rabbit cages taking up a whole lot <br/>
of space in my not so spacious apt. <br/>
  I am looking to sell them to someone who is going to use them rather <br/>
than have them sit in my house being useless. They're good cages that <br/>
I have paid a pretty penny for so if anyone is interested please let <br/>
me know off list. i have a few different sizes too.<br/>
I would like them to go to a good home and I know a fellow boxer would <br/>
put them to use. That is why i wanted to let everyone here know about <br/>
them before I sell them on e-bay or something.<br/>
<br/>
HAPPY TRAILS<br/>
