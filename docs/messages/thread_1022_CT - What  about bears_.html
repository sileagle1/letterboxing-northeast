<br/>
<br/>
  I was out boxing last night and ended up being longer than I <br/>
  thought.  Darkness was coming (in the woods anyways).  I saw some <br/>
  deer which were beautiful to see. But then it dawned on me.  There <br/>
  are bears in CT (and other places as well).  What do you do as a <br/>
  letterboxer if you come across one?  Does anyone carry anything that <br/>
  would help?  Just a thought....I am usually out boxing by myself <br/>

bear--unless your in Shenandoah NP or something--seeing a bear is <br/>
real treat.  I hiked the entire Appalachian Trail from Georgia to <br/>
Maine and one saw bears once--in the Shenandoahs.<br/>
<br/>
Bears are VERY shy animals.  You could walk by hundreds of them and <br/>
not even know they are there.  They hear or smell you coming from a <br/>
long way off, and generally make a point of steering clear of <br/>
people.  If you are *lucky* enough to see one, just don't do <br/>
something stupid like chase it and you should be okay.  =)<br/>
<br/>
And if you see cubs nearby, stand WAY back.<br/>

Even though I hadn't yet had lunch, I KNEW that noise did NOT come from me!  I mean, it stopped me dead in my tracks, and I'm not one to frighten easily.  It occurred to me that nothing could have made that noise except a verrry large (hungry?) animal.  Then I heard it again!  Knees shaking, and walking as fast as I could, I high-tailed out of those woods!  I carry an assortment of "protective paraphanalia" which I hope to never need, but put into a questionable situation... I just wanted OUT of there!  So, ladylee.... want a boxing partner?  lol  MayEve<br/>

avoid you.  Their senses are much more acute than yours, specially <br/>
their sense of smell.  You may spook one if you approch up wind, but <br/>
bears are more likely to run from something then turn to see what it <br/>
was.  If you do run into an aggresive bear your best chance of <br/>
survival is to back away and give ground.  Don't turn and run and all <br/>
the advice you hear about laying down and playing dead applies to <br/>
brown bears (not in this area) not black.  A brown bear is much more <br/>
likely to be aggressive and consider you a threat, if you play dead <br/>
you're no longer a threat and it may just go away.  If a black bear <br/>
is aggressive (which is very rare) he most likely considers you a <br/>
food sorce and you should defend yourself or give ground immediatly.<br/>

is a bit of overkill.  I've spent a lot of time on the trails and <br/>
have never found a need for either of them.<br/>
<br/>
Just be alert and use your common sense.  That's much more effective <br/>
than pepper spray or bells will ever be!<br/>

Well consider mansfield Bear country one has been spoted on our farm,<br/>
 and the one that visited a  Willimantic school recently left on a<br/>
beeline toward our farm. So if you go to Got Milk be sure you don't<br/>
get Got bear! Well I hope that bears don't do drive bys  but then I<br/>
didn't think they would do school either. I wear a bell but I am more<br/>
afraid of the hunters than being hunted.  Bear with me folks!   Leader<br/>
