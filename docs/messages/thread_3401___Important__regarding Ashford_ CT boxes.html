   The owner of the property does not want people visiting while they <br/>
are closed.  They have a small business there, plus a petting zoo. She <br/>
has asked that the cluesheets be revised to state the boxes are on <br/>
private property and will not  be available until May.<br/>
  I have e-mailed the placer, but am sure other finders also already <br/>
have.<br/>

  Also, I'm sorry to say the Quacker box has a smashed lid. I double-<br/>
bagged the box's contents to keep them dry.  I let owner know that much <br/>
more durable square boxes  are available at Joblot.</div>
