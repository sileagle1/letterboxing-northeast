<br/>
Wanda Miner is the winning letterboxer to first complete this 8 <br/>
county series and we offer her our congratulations for her effort!<br/>
<br/>
In an effort to keep this quest interesting, The Engraver has <br/>
suggested that we give you other boxers 1 year to complete this <br/>
series from today - 6/15/2005, after which a drawing will be held <br/>
from all of the eligible boxers who have completed this series for 10 <br/>
personalized gifts. <br/>
<br/>
"So 10 lucky letterboxers out of all who finish will get a <br/>
personalized gift from The Engraver!" [Thank you, Don Pardo]<br/>
<br/>
I thought we would end this fun series [not that it hasn't hit a few <br/>
bumps in the road!! - HH!!] with - what else - a gathering. Look for <br/>
details to come for the CT Stamp Series Gathering to take place some <br/>
time next summer.<br/>
<br/>
Until then, get all 8 stamps, email me with your scanned images, or <br/>
email me for our snail mail address. And if you complete the series, <br/>
your name will be added to the CT Stamp Series Hall of Fame page <br/>
located on our webpage.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!! [and complete the CT series!]<br/>
<br/>
Mark &amp; Sue Pepe, along with The Engraver</div>
