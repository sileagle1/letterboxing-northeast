correct Refuge Brook box, I came across another LB lying open in the <br/>
trail located near some large square concrete blocks. The spiral <br/>
notepad was soaked and on the ground, the small stamp (a rough carving <br/>
of a bird) was still in the box, swimming in a pool of water. That was <br/>
it.. no baggies, pencils, ink or anything else lying around that I <br/>
could identify. I took it home and after the notebook dried out I was <br/>
able to peel apart the pages. From what I could see from the orange <br/>
blur.. the notepad was stamped/signed only once. I think the date was <br/>
May 25th? and it said the Donahue Group. I'm thinkng this may be the <br/>
planter because there didn't seem to be any LB title page.  I'm also <br/>
thinking this box is/was not listed anywhere? Does anyone know anything <br/>
about it or who owns it?    K*</div>
