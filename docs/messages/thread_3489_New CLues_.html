it had completely washed away from the heavy rains we had recenly. We <br/>
went out to check on it today and had to hunt for it--luckily we found <br/>
it not too far upstream!  Also, it was in a Lock &amp; Lock box--<br/>
EVERYTHING was completly DRY!!!!<br/>
It has been moved to another location within the same area and the <br/>
clues have been updated.<br/>
Enjoy!  Howling Wolf</div>
