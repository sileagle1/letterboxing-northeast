<br/>
I'm in cyberspace for 48 hours, and wanted to let you know:<br/>
<br/>
Just Bass is Just Fine, in the same old space, dry and secure.  <br/>
Previous reports of MIA were erroneous.  My 10 year old spotted the <br/>
cairn from 20 feet away when we checked on it today.  Found twice <br/>
already in August.<br/>
<br/>
Point Judith has been fully restored with new baggies, new inkpad, <br/>
and new pen.  Found twice already in August (same finders as Just <br/>
Bass).<br/>
<br/>
Note:  The LbNA database has a glitch.  I, as Warrior Woman, am <br/>
unable to add new letterboxes for some reason.  I can edit my own, <br/>
but I cannot add any new ones.  I had done some meddling to fix the <br/>
problem on my own and ended up deleting Point Judith, only to <br/>
discover that I couldn't add it back.  I just went in and added the <br/>
clues to Point Judith to the Just Bass clues, and created a 2 box <br/>
entry so that folks could access the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Private emails to Wes Garrison have not fixed the problem (this has <br/>
been going on ever since the "conversion" a year or more ago), and <br/>
now I had to resort to a public plea on the LbNA forum (Flames Away!)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone needs me, catch me while you can!  I will return to <br/>
cyberspace, and MA, in the fall, when I will recarve and <br/>
replace "Thrill Me" - probably as a microbox, since I have discovered <br/>
that this location sees quite a bit of "thrill me flames of passion".<br/>
<br/>
(oh, to be young again!)<br/>
