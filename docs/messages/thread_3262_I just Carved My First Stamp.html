<br/>
Well -<br/>
I did it!<br/>
I just carved my first stamp.<br/>
I am very excited it came out pretty good.<br/>
I carved it on a regular pink eraser 1" by 2 1/2 "<br/>
I bought at the dollar store.<br/>
<br/>
Now I want to glue it on to another eraser.<br/>
What type of glue should I use???<br/>
Some stamp carving sites say rubber cement.<br/>
Others use wood glue but I think that is if you mount it on a wooden <br/>
base.<br/>
I don't want this to fall apart.<br/>
<br/>
I can't believe this stamp came out good.<br/>
Much better than I expected.<br/>
Can't you tell I'm excited?<br/>
<br/>
Ok, now I can be ready to plant my very first letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
" Oh Joy!!!"<br/>
<br/>
Blessings to all you wonderfull letterboxers out there.<br/>

It is so exciting!  ...and when you plant your first letterbox, you will want to check it every week to see who stamped in.  I still get so excited when I plant.  It is so gratifying to give back to the community by planting and to hear feedback on your box.<br/>
<br/>
  Way to go and keep up the good work!<br/>
<br/>
  Enjoy!<br/>

I'll never forget carving my initials in an eraser I had laying around<br/>
while I was at work one afternoon because I had just recently<br/>
discovered letterboxing, and I couldn't wait another moment to try my<br/>
hand at carving...<br/>
<br/>
the rest, is history!<br/>
Have FUN!<br/>
