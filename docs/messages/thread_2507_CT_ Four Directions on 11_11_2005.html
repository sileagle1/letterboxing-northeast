<br/>
If you are interested in joining us, please e-mail me off list.  Depending on who's going, we may meet in the Westfarms Mall area.  I would like to get to the Cornwall area by 8:30 a.m.  (which would mean a 7:45 departure from the Westfarms area).<br/>
<br/>
Also, we would need to take two cars, since we will be spotting cars.  If you are interested in driving, please let me know that as well.  :-)<br/>
