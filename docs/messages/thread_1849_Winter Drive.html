when I wasn't able to join you.  I came down with a nasty case of the flu, and <br/>
there was just no way that I could have left the apartment.  I could barely <br/>
walk across the room, let alone go letterboxing!  I also missed my rehearsal <br/>
last night and didn't go to work today.  My head still hurts...  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, as someone (Mom of 3?) reminded me, winter doesn't technically end <br/>
until March 20 or so.  So maybe there's still time for another event... one that <br/>
I can actually attend.  ;)<br/>

*SICK* to go letterboxing!<br/>

If you want it, Chrissy, email your snailmail to Mark Pepe and tell <br/>
