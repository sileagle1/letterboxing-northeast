couple that stand out.<br/>
First, it's generally agreed that any of the various 'baby wipes' are<br/>
discouraged because the scent may be attractive to critters. <br/>
Second, since hand-carved stamps may be more fragile than<br/>
store-boughts, any scrubbing should be avoided lest the stamp be<br/>
damaged during the cleaning.<br/>
I've seen lots of boxers just use damp paper towel -- just 'stamp'<br/>
repeatedly until the ink residue is gone.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

bottle and then patting it dry with a paper towel works really well.<br/>
