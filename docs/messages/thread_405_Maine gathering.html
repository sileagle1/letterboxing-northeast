                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1713138635">Thanks to all those who made the trek to (southern) maine for the "Letterboxing at <br/>
Laudholm" event this past weekend. I'm happy to say that we had around 40 people <br/>
attend though we were still missing a few from the north country. Alas, though the <br/>
weather was typically new england, I think it remained nice throughout the day on <br/>
Sunday. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you to Casco Bay Painter for her creative contributions to the game in southern <br/>
maine, thank you to Merenwen and Olwe for their fantastic pouches (putting mine to <br/>
shame!!!) and their innovative approaches, and thanks to Deb Blanchard for coming <br/>
through on her presentation despite some of the technical challenges.  Thank you <br/>
AmyMisha for organizing the pre-event dinner and Nautilus and Culex for your <br/>
gracious hospitality throughout the weekend :-)<br/>
<br/>
And finally THANK YOU to those who attended making all our efforts worthwhile. It is <br/>
so nice to know that others enjoy our wonderful boxes and trails that are so special <br/>
to us in Maine. I hope that this will encourage many of you to come up in the summer <br/>
and try Deb's "Lakes Region Letterboxing Trail" when it is put out for the season.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who have digital images please post pictures and/or contact <br/>
us when they are ready - I'd love to have some copies.<br/>
