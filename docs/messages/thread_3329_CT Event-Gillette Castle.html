program this summer featuring a different State Park each weekend <br/>
offering activities and prizes to participating families.  It was so <br/>
well accepted, that they are doing another one at Gillette Castle, <br/>
Dec. 2&amp;3, from 10 a.m.-3 p.m.  They have asked us to "man" a table <br/>
highlighting Letterboxing. They are supplying paper, stamps, and ink <br/>
to interested people. They have an event stamp,also. We are planting 2 <br/>
new boxes.  Anyone wishing to stop by and check the activities out, <br/>
and maybe lend a hand, would be greatly welcomed. It will be a great <br/>
day for kids of ALL ages, with lots to do. Hope to see you there!<br/>

visited relatived down there a few years ago when my<br/>
kids were little and we all went and toured the castle<br/>
and had a picnic lunch in the picnic area afterwards. <br/>
Great place to visit.  I wish I lived closer.  I'd<br/>
come to that event.  Oh, but I'm leaving on my cruise<br/>
on Dec. 2 anyway.  Hope to find those boxes in St.<br/>
Thomas.  I'll let ya'll know when I get back.<br/>

Wyassup Lake, who would like a dog for her children but isn't able to take<br/>
on the responsibilities of ownership at this point, so the idea of leasing<br/>
