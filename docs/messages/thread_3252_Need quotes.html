the letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
What do you love about letterboxing?<br/>
Where have you letterboxed?  In CT?  Along the Coast/Shoreline?  <br/>
What are some of the joys of letterboxing?<br/>
What are some of the frustrations?<br/>
Do you carve your own stamp?  (could you provide a pix to use in the article?)<br/>
Do you go alone? Or in a group (family, boyscouts)?<br/>
What kind of letterboxes do you go after?  What are your favorites?<br/>
<br/>
Please contact me offline.<br/>
And I need your full name and address for legal compliance.   Your address <br/>
will remain confidential<br/>
