There will be a list of boxes local to the event and there is sometimes a list of personal travelers that attendees will be bringing.<br/>
Also, some people are happy to share their personal stamps and will do so if you ask when met on the trail. <br/>
Sometimes there is some question that needs to be answered (usually trivia of some sort).<br/>
<br/>
It is always good to ask questions! There is also a Newbie Chat site that would be very helpful to you. <br/>
Does any one have the info for Mark Pepe's List?<br/>
Any questions that can't be answered by the information links at AQ or LBNA can be asked at this list.<br/>
<br/>
When someone new comes to the chat list they invariably ask the same questions as you and this can get bothersome to some of the people who have been boxing for awhile. Especially if they have not had their coffee yet!<br/>
Have a great time with this hobby - Dave and I hope to meet you sometime, perhaps on the trail.<br/>
