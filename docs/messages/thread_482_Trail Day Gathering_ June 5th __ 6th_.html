The first Saturday in June is National Trails Day. This is an event<br/>
designed to get people out to do trail work, to participate in hikes<br/>
and clinics and become aware of the trails available to them for<br/>
their recreational enjoyment as well as how important it is to<br/>
maintain them.<br/>
<br/>
Eastern Mountain Sports has been a part of National Trails Day since<br/>
it began 10 years ago. The EMS store in Danbury in conjunction with<br/>
The Great American Stamp Store and several dedicated letterboxers<br/>
are planning to host a gathering on June 5th from 10-3 PM. The CT<br/>
Forest and Parks Association and Eastern Mountain Sports are<br/>
publisizing this event.<br/>
<br/>
Events will include ...<br/>
* a clinic on letterboxing to introduce new people<br/>
* a stamp carving class by Brian of Team GreenDragon<br/>
* carving/letterboxing supplies by The Great American Stamp Store<br/>
* plenty of additional letterboxes on the property and nearby areas<br/>
<br/>
In addition, plans are in the works for camping permits on the<br/>
property. All those letterboxers who stay for the campfire that<br/>
evening to swap stories and roast smores will also get a special<br/>
event stamp. All those letterboxers who campout will recieve yet<br/>
another event stamp. But wait ... there's more ...<br/>
<br/>
Clues to "Things That Go Bump In The Night" will be distributed at<br/>
sunset. These limited edition letterboxes will only be around from<br/>
sunset to sunrise on June 5th to 6th. If you have never letterboxed<br/>
at night ... believe me, it is fantastic!<br/>
<br/>
I hope you all come from near and far to this wonderful event. If<br/>
you have some ideas you would like to share for this event feel free<br/>
to drop me an email at: Letterboxer2002@y...<br/>

Can we do it by lantern instead of flashlight? You ruin your night vision if you switch <br/>
on the headlamp...This does sound enticing. Thanks for the info!<br/>

no clouds it could possibly be done by moon light?<br/>
