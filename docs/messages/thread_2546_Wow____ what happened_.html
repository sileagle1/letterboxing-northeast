Its amazing how individuals and little groups can publicly battle like <br/>
this. These discussions really should be taken off list and settled <br/>
best (perhaps?) by just ignoring each other. This particular list has <br/>
interesting dynamics because MANY of us have met face to face and <br/>
really know each other better than just "penpals". I find it hard to <br/>
believe that neighbors can sleep at night when they are out bashing <br/>
each other in front of mutual friends. Remember that there's always 3 <br/>
sides to a story and that writing to a public forum while you still <br/>
have a clenched fist often results with egg on your face. <br/>
<br/>
As a moderator on the big list, I've always steered those who send me <br/>
emails to the effect of "Leaving the big list because of the <br/>
bitterness" towards these regional lists because they tend to be <br/>
kindler and gentler. I'm beginning to rethink that decision and <br/>
guidance. <br/>
<br/>
As far as clue removal from the site....go for it! But bring them back <br/>
once the storm blows through. There's too many good boxes out there <br/>
that need to be shared and enjoyed by all!  If you are worried about <br/>
vandalism, make your box harder by either clues, tricks, or longer <br/>
hikes. Not only will you avoid the "casual" letterboxer who is after <br/>
the numbers, but you will make the hike more enjoyable for the rest of <br/>
us. <br/>

been peaceful and friendly.  When I look at the main list I know to <br/>
wear my asbestos suit (oops must use some newer high tech <br/>
material).  I have had the pleasure of meeting many of us on this <br/>
list and never had an ugly word with anyone.  Please, everyone, try <br/>
to keep it that way.<br/>
