<br/>
The cat is out of the bag, er, so to speak.  In fact it is missing from  She Swallowed a Bat series.  The wizard is alive and well though.  One of us will re-carve the cat, put it in a new spot, and post the revised clues within the next few weeks.  <br/>
<br/>
I did tweak the clues, however, for the wizard as they were a little off.  (Must have been Curly's fault, yuk,yuk,yuk!)<br/>
