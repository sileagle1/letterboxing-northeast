  By visiting your website now and then, I can read of your finds (in <br/>

me!<br/>

</span></blockquote>I'd just like to say (my classic statement) that I'm "not sure how I feel" (note: strong <br/>
opinion to follow this statement) regarding the dialogue on people's webpages <br/>
about their finds. I love it in the sense that it is an online journal, which I maintain <br/>
myself, but as far as giving away mystery boxes or by defacto on the same date, <br/>
etc. I think I'll never read about someone's adventure just on my own choice. I don't <br/>
want any spoilers, I don't like seeing stamps ahead of time on people's webpages <br/>
either and I don't want to have their experience bias my hunting.<br/>
<br/>
Just the scientist in me.<br/>
Unfortunately those who enjoy those stories won't find them in anything but clue <br/>
form for boxes that I've placed so as not to give away anybody else's ideas or clues.<br/>
<br/>
