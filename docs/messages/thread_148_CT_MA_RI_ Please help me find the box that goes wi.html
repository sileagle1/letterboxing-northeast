been to the box (because I have the stamp!) but I don't know which box it is.  <br/>
It looks hand carved, and its a blue cloud with a face inside and the face <br/>
inside is crying rain.  I think I was at this box two summers ago, since it looks <br/>
like it's on the same paper that Darrin used in his logbook.<br/>

Help!<br/>
