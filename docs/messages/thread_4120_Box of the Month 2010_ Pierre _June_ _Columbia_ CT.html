 <br/>
There has been a bit of a change to the clues to reflect the changing trails. This is a very new preserve that is still a work in progress. <br/>
 <br/>
We were checking out the community garden while we were there to day.<br/>
 <br/>
Be sure to get this box if you enjoy amazing carvings and wonderful boxes ;-) It was created by Feather of WA and is well worth the trip.<br/>
