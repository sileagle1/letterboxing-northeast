</span></blockquote>Maybe someone (or the placer) can scan you a pic of the piece for <br/>
pasting into your book.  Not actually a find but that and a nickel <br/>
would get you, hmmmmm, nothing?<br/>
<br/>
Such are the woes of LB'rs.  I still want to find Maine Man at <br/>
Hammonasset Park - 1-1/2 hrs poking under rocks was just as <br/>
disappointing--think how many finds I could have done with that time <br/>
if Butterfly had me in tow!!!  And it cost me $10 to park--gotta a <br/>
nickel to spare %^?<br/>
