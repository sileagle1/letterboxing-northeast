does lead to some interesting new vocabulary being thrown out there. <br/>
Thanks Butterfly-yes, the DEP stamp program has been such a marvelous <br/>
venue for learning more about our state parks.  The clue sheets <br/>
provide well researched info. to read as one hikes to the golden pot <br/>
at the end of the rainbow (*a.k.a. "letterbox").  I have not earned <br/>
the patch which the DEP will award if one stamps into 5 of the <br/>
letterboxes placed in our state forests. I certainly plan to do so, <br/>
if the offer extends into next spring. I bet you got all the stamps <br/>
and earned a walking stick!!  I am so eager to see SwampYankee's <br/>
stamp. Hopefully the opportunity will arise for me (and others) to do <br/>
so.<br/>
