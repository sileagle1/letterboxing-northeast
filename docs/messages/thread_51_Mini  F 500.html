was especially for the F500 folks.  The weather man promise of snow<br/>
tomorrow sort of forced us join in today. I hope no one was upset by<br/>
the different turn of events. Leader of the Pack is still planning to<br/>
have a few more boxes join into the mix. They will all be at her house<br/>
until sometime next week.  I have heard from a few others also that<br/>
want to send.  If you wish to add your greeting and stamp into these<br/>
boxe ,I will be around with them untill after Christmas.  Please<br/>
contact me off line . A big thank you to all who added their greetings<br/>
and personal stamps.  It will be so nice to share with other. <br/>
