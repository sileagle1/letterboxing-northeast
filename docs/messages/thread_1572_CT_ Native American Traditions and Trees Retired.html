UPDATE: Series Retired 11-7-04<br/>
<br/>
These boxes are being retired/removed for repair/relocation. Two <br/>
boxes were carried off by animals in only a few months time. Chuck <br/>
and Molly miraculously recovered the Spruce Box, however, the <br/>
Tamarack box was completely destroyed. Due to every critter's <br/>
curiosity, this will forever remind me to keep tempting (food) scents <br/>
away from boxes and always cover the boxes with heavy objects.<br/>
