The Trustees opened a new property this month, Moose Hill Farm in <br/>
Sharon. The trail map is on their website.  At the kiosk in the parking <br/>
lot are directions for a quest - though the number of copies was low <br/>
this weekend. So far, the quest directions don't appear on the website.<br/>

<br/>
Anyway, it is a pretty property and the stamp is hand made. <br/>
<br/>
The Trustees are opening a couple of other properties later this Fall. <br/>
One called Signal Hill in Canton (next town to Sharon). I don't know if <br/>
they'll have quests there or not, but at minimum there will be new <br/>
trails to place boxes on!<br/>
