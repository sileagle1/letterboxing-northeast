steal so perhaps we should all get out there as much as possible to<br/>
the parks they will likely target next such as Rocky Neck,Hartman,etc<br/>
and keep ours eyes open for suspicious people carrying a lot of<br/>
tupperware on thier person.Maybe we can catch these S.O.B.'s in the<br/>
act.They may be a bit less inclined after that to continue especially<br/>
if someone can get a license plate # or something.I can see the<br/>
headline now . . . Angry LBers Chase Astonished Picnickers . . . hahaha</div>

<br/>
Are there any NE boxers that are also geocachers?  Or have geocaching <br/>
friends?  Or are willing to go on the geocaching dot com forums?<br/>
<br/>
My thought is this...I'm wondering if perhaps this person or group is <br/>
not just targeting boxes...but caches as well.  The reasoning is that <br/>
perhaps the theif/theives are not just out to steal the boxes because <br/>
they have a tupperware defiency...perhaps they think NO boxes/caches <br/>
should be in the wild?  Sort of a wacky enviromental slant of NO ONE <br/>
gets to leave ANYTHING in the woods...<br/>
<br/>
does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps a inquiry into the geocaching community would produce some <br/>
answers.  At the very least...it would have more people out there on <br/>
the trails on the lookout for sinister behavior.<br/>
<br/>
just a thought...<br/>
<br/>
and when this blows over...let us out in the Pacific Northwest <br/>
know...we would love to help replace and bolster the numbers of boxes <br/>
in the NE!</div>

I also logged into the geocaching forum to see whether this was happening to them, and this is happening in NY right now with the geocaching community.  I sent a quick note of condolences and relayed our situation.  Maybe someone will write back.<br/>
