I just received a notice from a finder today that the box stamp itself is missing as well as the log book. In its place is a hitchhiker named Car Ferry by mudflinginfools. The box stamp is stamped into the hitchhiker, so it must have just recently been removed. <br/>
 <br/>
I am hoping that the last finder accidentally took the box stamp instead of the hitchhiker. <br/>
 <br/>
PLEASE, if you have been there recently, check your bag and see if maybe you took the box stamp by accident.<br/>
If so, please contact me and I will work out getting it back in place for others to find.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks so much.<br/>
