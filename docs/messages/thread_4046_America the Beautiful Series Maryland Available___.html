By the way, does anyone have any restaurant suggestions in the area of the America the Beautiful series?  We'll be based in the Vernon area, near I-84, so that is an area of particular interest.  We like seafood, ethnic, brew pubs, pizza and more.  Prefer non-chain establishments if possible.<br/>

Greetings from the shoreline .  my niece Cindy will not be here this week end , so if you do try to reach me by phone , it won't work <br/>
Donutz and I hike often and she is going to try to reach you and  get us to meet somehow over the week end , perhaps just for lunch , so I hope that works out .  We have only  hunted three of the boxes , in Columbia &amp; Andover , so are open to the whole series .<br/>
Bugs are busy around here now , so spray up good  and have a wonderful time .<br/>
smile<br/>
Nancy , aka butterfly<br/>
<br/>

Great news! We hope to look for it this weekend.<br/>

By the way, does anyone have any restaurant suggestions in the area of the America the Beautiful series? We'll be based in the Vernon area, near I-84, so that is an area of particular interest. We like seafood, ethnic, brew pubs, pizza and more. Prefer non-chain establishments if possible.<br/>
