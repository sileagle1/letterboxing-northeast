tomorrow, as this is the second report of it being missing. If it is not<br/>
there, I will do my best (as its caretaker) to carve a replacement, even if<br/>
it is a temporary one while I confer with Aisling.<br/>
Either way, I will post to the list to let you all know if it is there (and<br/>
maybe misplaced) or if a new one will be made.<br/>

appeared to be the tree mentioned in the clue had been cut down and the <br/>
rock was at the base of the tree stump. It looked fairly recent at the <br/>
time since the chips were still fresh and the rest of the tree was still <br/>
there and they were just starting to cut it up. We notified Aisling (the <br/>
placer) that we didn't find it and thought the tree might have been cut <br/>
down and thought she might want to contact the forestry center to see if <br/>
they had her box. I don't know if she ever checked on it. Do let us know <br/>
if you find it!<br/>
