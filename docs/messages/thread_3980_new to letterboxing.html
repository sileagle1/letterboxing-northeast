I don't blame them, though, woodpeckers can get on your nerves :)   Enjoy all the boxing adventures in the future.<br/>

<br/>
I have been letterboxing with my son (now 8) for three years.  It is  <br/>
definitely a disappointment when that box isn't there.  Make sure when  <br/>
you check the clue online, that someone has found the box very  <br/>
recently - that greatly increases your chance that it will be there.   <br/>
Also, pick boxes that are planted off the beaten path.  They are less  <br/>
likely to disappear than boxes hidden in an obvious hollow tree, or  <br/>
someplace easily found by non-boxers passing by.  Sometimes you really  <br/>
have to persevere and double-check that you are closely following the  <br/>
directions.  The box could be under your nose.  It's hard to keep at  <br/>
it, with the kids getting impatient while you look - but it's actually  <br/>
a good lesson for them in sticking to a task.<br/>
<br/>
It's definitely worth the effort to keep trying it with them.  The  <br/>
look on my son's face when he got his 50th box was priceless.  Our log  <br/>
book contains the story of each day that we went boxing, and now it's  <br/>
a real treasure of memories.<br/>

I had been hoping to do some hiking/letterboxing this week<br/>
while the kids are out of school, but I seem to have gotten the flu<br/>
(despite having gotten the vaccine).<br/>
<br/>
I will put all of your tips to use and try again with renewed<br/>

On both sites there is a way of seeing when the last letterboxer found that box. <br/>
Try to go for boxes that have recently been found - at least for the near future - so the boys don't get discouraged.<br/>
It's hard to convince you children that the hike is enough! <br/>
Also include areas that have something else to offer that the boys will enjoy - like a good romp in a nearby playground or searching for shells and rocks on a beach.<br/>
Before going out (if you plan ahead) try contacting the placer about the box. If they don't get back to you, don't go after the box.<br/>
Good Luck and I hope we meet on the trail sometime.<br/>

  Hi Michele, Welcome to the "fun" of letterboxing. I get my clues from www.atlasquest.com I find this web site more user friendly then LbNA. You can search boxes by town/city, hike length, and difficulty. They even list drive bys if you want/need a quick box to keep the boys interest up. I sometimes box with my "almost 9 year old" Grand daughter and most days she's only good for one box and maybe a quick drive by. I live in MA above Worcester and would love to meet you and the boys if you're ever up this way. <br/>

  Subject: [LbNE] new to letterboxing <br/>
<br/>
  Hello all. I am new to letterboxing and trying to get my family <br/>
  involved, and I need some beginner's help. We have three boys (3, 5 <br/>
  and 7) and live in RI. <br/>
<br/>
  Our first attempt to find a letterbox was a success (sort of). We <br/>
  found one of two letterboxes in Beaver River park in RI, and the boys <br/>
  were thrilled to have found one and to use the stamps that they had <br/>
  made. However, since then, we have had no success out of four attempts <br/>
  (two of which, I will admit, were only half-hearted efforts). I am <br/>
  happy to keep searching, but the boys are losing interest. <br/>
<br/>
  We have gotten our clues from the letterboxing.org website. I have <br/>
  read the Letterboxer's Companion and the letterboxing.org website. <br/>
<br/>
  Can anyone offer some tips to a newbie? For example, is it common for <br/>
  letterboxes to get "lost" after a while? How do you pick sites for <br/>
  success? <br/>
<br/>
  Thanks in advance, <br/>
<br/>

to it also, but, like you, I'm bringing, sometimes dragging 2 children<br/>
along on the expeditions.  For the most part, they've been great, but<br/>
they're getting a little weary of it now.  They are much more<br/>
interested in climbing the trees than caring what's in the boxes we find.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you have tons of fun!  I look forward to hearing about your<br/>
adventures.<br/>

<br/>
But this brings up another topic: automatic letterbox clue backups. When we post our clues to letterboxing.org, we have the option to archive the clues at <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lbox-announce/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lbox-announce/</a><br/>
<br/>
I think that is a great place to store our backups. But if we only put a link to our personal website in the clues then the lbox-announce archive won't help a bit when our websites go down.<br/>
<br/>
So I suggest that we boxers who keep clues on personal websites also cut and paste the actual clues into the letterboxing.org Add A Box page. Then our text will be stored both at LbNA and on the yahoogroup archive. Poof! Free backups! This helped Margaret and I quite a bit earlier this year when our own website went down unexpectedly.<br/>
<br/>
Just a suggestion, Jay in CT<br/>
