They are VERY bad already.   I pulled 5 off of me and the dog on Tuesday,<br/>

PS.  Frost does NOT kill ticks.   Anyone with dogs will tell you ticks were<br/>
around all winter long this past winter.<br/>

really out there and have been for a few months. Essential oils don't <br/>
really work. To my knowledge, there is no scientific evidence to back <br/>
this up. However, a compound commonly sold at outdoor supply stores (LL <br/>
Bean, EMS, even WalMart) called permethrin is quite effective at keeping <br/>
ticks off of clothing. Permethrin is only applied to clothing, not skin, <br/>
and will last for several wash cycles. It breaks down in contact with <br/>
skin oils but doesn't do anything detrimental. You can still use DEET <br/>
though on your skin, but keep it at 20%. Using the 100% doesn't give you <br/>
any extra protection.<br/>
A good website with info is the CDC Lyme site<br/>

suggested and in addition, you can check yourself afterwards<br/>
thoroughly - and wash your clothes right away. It has been my<br/>
experience that the wooded areas of Southern Maine have a much higher<br/>
(deer) tick population in proportion to other areas. To date, I have<br/>
not noticed a significant tick issue in Northern Maine, 'cept the time<br/>
that I was walking a local trail in Bangor near the animal shelter<br/>
alongside a river. Man, watch out for that!<br/>
