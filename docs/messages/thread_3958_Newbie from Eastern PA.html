to use atlasquest.com too.  I've found that most boxes are listed on both<br/>
but some are only listed on one or the other so it's good to check both.<br/>

<br/>
We also use atlasquest.com.  There are some common boxes between both <br/>
sites as well as hyperlinks between the sites when clicking on the <br/>
clues.  We also started this very addictive hobby recently and are <br/>
having a blast learning about areas practically in our back yard.  <br/>
Being in Central NJ, we may cross paths some day.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck and Happy New Year!!<br/>
