                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-927762117">A new Hitchhiker Hostel, "Christmas Spirit" is available in North <br/>
Billerica, Massachusetts.  It consists of 3 boxes, two of which are <br/>
far easier than my usual offerings.  The third box, Glacial Action <br/>
provides a longer hike and some educational material.  It is a micro-<br/>
box, a 35mm film canister.  Opening was delayed until "Shotgun" deer <br/>
hunting season ended.<br/>
<br/>
All three boxes are winter placements, and are immune to snow.  The <br/>
main box is only partially sheltered from snowfall, but since its <br/>
volume is 14.5 liters, (equals seven 2-liter soda bottles) it is <br/>
still easy to find.  The two satellite boxes are completely sheltered <br/>
from snow.  All three are in plain sight, once you look from the <br/>
correct spot.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to the people who helped me check the clues and <br/>
created/provided hitchhikers for the hostels.  One of the outlying <br/>
boxes was converted to a hostel at the last minute to reduce <br/>
confusion while stamping into the 5 hitchhikers that remain in <br/>
the "Christmas Spirit" box.  Many Thanks to Choi, DDD, and Wildcats.  <br/>
Since they were generally ineligible for "First Finder," two First <br/>
Finder opportunities still exist.<br/>
<br/>
If you have avoided letterboxing in the snow until now, and you live <br/>
in the Billerica area I hope that you will stop in to visit these <br/>
boxes sometime.  The current plan is to remove all hitchhikers after <br/>
winter ends, for the following reasons.  At some times of year the <br/>
last 25 feet to the main hostel is infested with ticks.  In good <br/>
weather, the hitchhikers can return to active circulation.  Some <br/>
hitchhiker owners might also want their hitchhikers in more remote <br/>
locations, during fair weather.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>
