Well, if y'all are interested in Maine. Mount Agamenticus in York,<br/>
Maine  has a cabin that is available to rent. Heated with a fireplace<br/>
and folding tables atop the Mountain. It might be difficult to drive<br/>
up there, but I imagine that they plow it seasonally. <br/>
<br/>
If you folks think that might be fun, I can certainly investigate for<br/>
pricing. I've been there for various meetings and during winter for a<br/>
conservation corps meeting. The views on a sunny day are amazing...not<br/>
to mention that there are many nearby southern maine letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Just an idea,<br/>

Does Warrior Woman know of this list?  She is from near the center of MA and might have some suggestions.  I like Phyto's idea of the lodge but I'm not too keen on trucking up too far north unless we were staying for a day or two, or more, like for that gathering in Maine this past summer. (Which Dan and I both enjoyed.  Great place.) <br/>
<br/>
Now, there's supposed to be some sort of get-together for the F100 traveling stamp, yes?  Can it be the same event to kick off the new NE talk list or do you (anyone) think that would imply only those with 100 or more Fs should come? Would this be acceptable to the organizer of the F100 event in western MA?  (Or has the "real" one already happened and I'm slow on the updake?)<br/>

in Rye NH is a beautiful spot Jay Drew and I have some boxes there. <br/>
It is an old military  spot so boys  love the WWII  gun placements <br/>
etc. There is a science center there with tables and bathrooms etc. <br/>
It is about a 2  plus hour drive from Ct and near the shore usually <br/>
gets less snow.  I would be happy to look into it.  So not to bad <br/>
from  Ct. Mass or Maine. No hills either.   Carol - Leader of the Pack<br/>

First let me say how pleased I am to see this list and how excited I am <br/>
to hear a winter gathering is in the works. I've managed to meet a few <br/>
of you, but there are still many more I have not met yet (but hope to soon).<br/>
As far as winter gathering places go, I love the building on top of Mt. <br/>
A, but the road is a bear in winter and they close it off sometimes due <br/>
to weather conditions. I'd especially rule it out if we would have to <br/>
pay a rental fee.<br/>
I've got another idea for a spot you're familiar with and love and that <br/>
I might just have a bit of pull at &lt;grin&gt;. Think Laudholm Farm in the <br/>
Mather Auditorium where we could have it for free. We don't have a <br/>
fireplace, but have got plenty of tables and chairs, audio-visual <br/>
equipment if we wanted it, access to a kitchen, and lots of historic <br/>
charm. There's also 7 miles of trails perfect for snowshoeing and cross <br/>
country skiing with a few of Phyto's beautifully carved boxes planted <br/>
there. It's in southernmost Maine and just a quick jaunt off the <br/>
highway, so easy to get to. Maine is pretty far north for a lot of folks <br/>
who might be interested in coming though.<br/>

Farmer Harvey, owner of the farm where my "Peace on Earth" letterbox <br/>

This is located in Westborough, MA, near the intersection of Routes <br/>
