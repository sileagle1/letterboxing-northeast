the number of visitors and the quality and variety of the stamps. <br/>
This person saw this as a way to attract visitors to other land trust<br/>

activity for children of hunting letterboxes on land trust<br/>
properties, rewarding those who find all available with a t-shirt on<br/>
Avon Day in September.  The advice I need is what to tell them for<br/>
the newsletter.  What should I NOT do or say, especially.  Can I let<br/>
them photograph the contents of one of my boxes and publish some of<br/>
the stamp images in the newsletter?  They asked if they could do<br/>
that.  <br/>
<br/>
Would some of you be willing to place some boxes on Avon Land Trust<br/>
property?  I'm not sure how many they are anticipated nor what areas<br/>
they are considering, but I have already learned the location of one<br/>
area that I had not been able to find before.  I will be having a<br/>
phone conversation with them on Tuesday so will have more information<br/>
after that.  I'm working on new boxes but I'm sure they would like a<br/>
variety of placers.  Will keep you informed as I learn more.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-907562923">I would absolutely LOVE to carve a box. I grew up in Avon and it holds such a special place <br/>
in my heart. I lived on Blueberry Lane, off of Lovely Street. Talk about the idylic childhood! <br/>
Horses, farms and endless woods with waterfalls and glacial rock formations. I have so <br/>
much I'd like to commemorate. Just e-mail me off line and I'll get started right away.<br/>
<br/>
I personally think that it's exciting that a Land trust is asking for boxes. I would say that <br/>
you could let them photograph anything that you own. Or anyone else's letterbox with <br/>
their permission. <br/>
<br/>
I'm planning on coming to Avon this summer with Songbird ( ...you know who that is :-)  !<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with the newsletter.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>

That is fantastic news.  I'm glad they recognized the benefits of <br/>
having boxes on their properties.  An introdiction to letterboxing <br/>
and pointers to the web sites are appropriate for their newsletter.<br/>
<br/>
As far as images, just your own stamp images or those where you have <br/>
permission from the artist/carver should be published.  Also do not <br/>
publish the real or trail name of any other letterboxer, without <br/>
permission from them.  Those have been the problems in the past.  A <br/>
photo of the box and contents would be fine, without any stamp <br/>
images showing.<br/>
<br/>
I could plant a box where one is needed.  Contact me off line.<br/>
