I feel that we should keep letterboxing private.  Just a couple of <br/>

(Hartford Courant to be precise).  However, we have had increasing <br/>

We need to make this effort to keep the hobby private.  We can not rely <br/>
on the news media to write an appropriate story on letterboxing.  I <br/>
have seen too many stories where the placements of letterboxes has been <br/>

unveiling the next generation of badges for girls aged 11-17, and one <br/>
of them is "Hi-Tech Hide and Seek" -- an entire badge about <br/>
letterboxing and geocaching.<br/>

<br/>
Girl Scouts all over America are going to be dabbling in letterboxing. <br/>
The best we can do as a community is to offer our skills and knowledge <br/>
to our local GS councils. Let's make sure the girls and leaders learn <br/>
proper 'boxing form right from the start.<br/>
<br/>
Please contact your local councils and offer to lead a workshop on <br/>
letterboxing dos and don'ts. Your expertise will be greatly <br/>
appreciated, and letterboxing across America will be enhanced, not <br/>
damaged, by the enthusiasm and creativity of all those girls.<br/>

introduced to it, get interested, plant boxes.....<br/>

<br/>
Personally, I think Letterboxing has gotten TOO much publicity in recent years.  Though it brings good people into the hobby, it also brings those who do not want to see our hobby.  There is a large amount of people out there who would probably gawk at the fact that we leave rubbermaid and stamps in the woods!  (Technically,) letterboxing and geocaching are littering and there are people out there who would think as much and pull the boxes.  I've met people who feel as though our boxes have no right up there and if we continue to get this influx of publicity, our boxes will be stolen, vandalized and we may not be allowed to box in public places!  Look at the National Park System!  Geocaching is allowed (for some reason) but letterboxing is not because it is thought that we are trampling precious vegetation etc....<br/>
<br/>
I feel as though this should be a WOM hobby only.<br/>

&gt; &gt; article on making a letterbox that's in our Getting<br/>

&gt; &gt; section section with what we what newbies to know and what<br/>
&gt; &gt; we expect in terms of etiquette. I think many letterboxes<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; years ago, I too found out about letterboxing through<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; (Hartford Courant to be precise).  However, we have had<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;increasing<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; have seen too many stories where the placements of<br/>

past summer, but like the person who just built a new house in the woods and wants a <br/>
ban on new development, it really is not possible nor fair to stop spreading the word <br/>
about letterboxing. I agree, face to face contact, telling friends about letterboxing is ideal, <br/>
but how many of us would be here were it not for SMithsonian's article, for NPR's piece, or <br/>
for more recent publicity?<br/>
<br/>
I think the problem lies in part because of letterboxing's appeal being the secrecy (at least <br/>
for me)...it is so amazing that this is going on and that most people are oblivious! Its draw <br/>
is its downfall. We are at a point in the US where we really cannot stop the media from <br/>
spreading the word. But I think there are other things you can do, as a placer: write more <br/>
difficult clues. I hate to say it, but most people will not continue to pursue letterboxing if it <br/>
is hard and won't grant them instant satisfaction (remember the "stupid and lazy" post <br/>
from Sangfroid several months ago? It is true!) You can also pull your clues and distribute <br/>
them in other ways. (WOM, alternate websites, inside other boxes etc) I personally find <br/>
boxes that are  hard to find clues for, hard to figure out and hard to actually find <br/>
extremely satisfying. <br/>
<br/>
Also, anyone can trash your boxes, animals, kids, partying teens...not just oblivious <br/>
newbies, some of whom may end up being fabulous carvers and placers if given the <br/>
correct tools and guidance.<br/>

<br/>
I learned of this hobby from the Smithsonian article which my mother <br/>
sent to me. By the time I started, she had passed away from cancer so <br/>
I was never able to box with her. But she would be proud that I have <br/>
made over 100 boxes accessible to all people, while retaining a few <br/>
special boxes as WOM. I do not offer myself for interviews but have <br/>
taken many newbies under my wing and escorted them to boxes..as well <br/>
as taught box etiquette. Just like experienced boxers did for ME. <br/>
Yes, some of my boxes have gone missing...mostly due to my own poor <br/>
placing skills...and mostly when I was a newbie.<br/>
<br/>
I am forever grateful to those who generously helped me learn and <br/>
shared their expertise with me. Mark and Sue Pepe, Catbead, Alafair, <br/>
Turtle McQ and a few others, to be exact. They have gained another <br/>
person who wants to share the great outdoors, cool places and neat <br/>
stamps with others. Do those "PRIVATE ONLY" boxers act this way with <br/>
other things? Do they not share a great new restaurant with others..a <br/>
good fishing hole...a store running a great sale..where to get lock-<br/>
n'lock?<br/>
<br/>
My OWN opinion..is if you want to make ALL your boxes WOM or for a <br/>
select few...do it. I won't miss your boxes in the least. But I urge <br/>
you to try EDUCATING new boxers...not EXCLUDING them. You were a new <br/>
boxer once, weren't you?<br/>

<br/>
It will be interested to see how long the Dunkin Donuts and McDonalds boxes will last now that the clues were plastered into the news article for all to see.  The other three boxes whose clues were in the article were inside stores, so they have a better chance of surviving.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, that there are a lot of people out there who do not accept our hobby.  For example, the NPS has outlawed letterboxing on National Park land (though they have not outlawed geocaching... which I don't understand).  The NPS has been known to confiscate boxes on their land.  This could happen anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
I feel as though our boxes that we plant are in many ways, "the box owner's property."  Shouldn't the news media respect the owner's wishes before putting information in a news article?<br/>
<br/>
I believe there was an instance in the southeastern part of the US within the last year that the reporter of a news story actually put the entire clue in a story.  (do I have that right, or is my memory failing me?)  These acts of reporters greatly compromise the boxes in question.<br/>
<br/>
I've seen too many boxes, which were in very good hiding places, go missing, stamps stolen, nasty things written inside the boxes etc... (many were my own boxes) mostly due to non-letterboxer interaction.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I do have two messages in at the newspaper for the reporter.  <br/>

<br/>
I couldn't agree more. In fact Lock Wench's entire reply was<br/>
eloquently put. Archimedes' Screw and I have had 4 boxes go missing.<br/>
Two were rehidden in their original placements by the individuals who<br/>
took them after they learned about letterboxing. One was returned by<br/>
two nine year olds on their bikes because the girl who had found it<br/>
and brought it home months earlier finally found out and understood<br/>
what it was. She even stamped in and wrote an apology in the log. The<br/>
other was returned by a town librarian after the gardner found it and<br/>
threw it in her book drop. She contacted us and asked about it, then<br/>
immediately re-hid it, and became a letterboxer herself. The other two<br/>
were not hidden well enough. I hate secrets. I love letterboxing for<br/>
the creativity that is offered freely to all. If an individual wants<br/>
to keep his/her boxes private then posting them on any web site is not<br/>
wise. As for me, I get great pleasure from leaving boxes where they<br/>
can and will be found. <br/>

letterboxing via an article in a newspaper.  We now have a new <br/>
favorite hobby.<br/>
<br/>
We were all ready hikers but would often not go because there was <br/>
just not enough "draw".  A big draw in fact.  We just replaced our <br/>
old car with a new one, mainly so that we could count on it to make <br/>
it all over the place reliably so that we could letter box (we might <br/>
be addicts).<br/>
<br/>
So, we are very glad that this article was written.  We now have <br/>
something to do that doesn't cost much and is extremly rewarding and <br/>
enjoyable for us.  As I write this we are F9's.<br/>
<br/>
I know you are worried about people trashing your boxes, but secrecy <br/>
will not necesarily aid in saving your boxes.  Some of the boxes <br/>
we've found were almost visible...a bit a white or blue showing in <br/>
the rocks and looking out of place from the trail...covering debris <br/>
looking very out of place in the surrounding landscape.  These could <br/>
have been seen, discovered and maybe trashed by the "uneducated" <br/>
(and we made an effort to solve this problem with extra leaves and <br/>
such).  However, they could have lead to new letterboxers who asked <br/>
the question upon finding them, "what is this letterboxing thing?"<br/>
Some missing boxes might be "missing" because someone who found them <br/>
took it upon themselves to take them home and replace wet items.  Of <br/>
the nine we've found so far, at least 3 were pretty moist and could <br/>
probably have used some attention from the planter...so e-mail <br/>
contact info is a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
Here's an analogy for you to ponder...<br/>
My wife and I work at a store.  The store is publicly known of.  <br/>
People come to the store and most of them use if for what it is <br/>
inteded...a place to buy things they want.  Others, however, and a <br/>
small percentage at that, do cause problems, make messes, steal and <br/>
in general disturb our lives.  Its like this with anything.  These <br/>
people are people after all, so what did you expect?  Life goes <br/>
on...don't let them ruin it for you/us...replant!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading this...and thanks for planting boxes.  Hopefully, <br/>
we'll start our own plantings in the spring.<br/>
<br/>

I've said this before:  When I put out a letterbox, I know that it is in peril.  That's the chance I take - like asking a girl out on a date, remember?  If you go 'secret', then you can still be trashed.  The best defenses against being trashed are:<br/>
1.  DON'T pick a party spot!<br/>
2.  Letterboxers that take more care in re-hiding than just throwing some leaves over the box.<br/>
3.  Good initial placement off of the beaten path (more than 2 feet!), but in a place that's not suspicious to be seen in.<br/>
<br/>
My brother-in-law found a letterbox by accident and asked my wife to look up what it all means.  She did and now we have a great new hobby.  Accidents happen, and can be good.<br/>
<br/>
I, too, have lost letterboxes.  It really bites when the box is several states away, too!  Will I pull my boxes away from my fellows?  Heck, no.  Others have, and we are all diminished thereby.  And I don't believe that they are more secure now, just less enjoyed.<br/>

  Make it private?!  I hope not.  My wife and I recently discovered <br/>
  letterboxing via an article in a newspaper.  We now have a new <br/>
  favorite hobby.<br/>
<br/>
  We were all ready hikers but would often not go because there was <br/>
  just not enough "draw".  A big draw in fact.  We just replaced our <br/>
  old car with a new one, mainly so that we could count on it to make <br/>
  it all over the place reliably so that we could letter box (we might <br/>
  be addicts).<br/>
<br/>
  So, we are very glad that this article was written.  We now have <br/>
  something to do that doesn't cost much and is extremly rewarding and <br/>
  enjoyable for us.  As I write this we are F9's.<br/>
<br/>
  I know you are worried about people trashing your boxes, but secrecy <br/>
  will not necesarily aid in saving your boxes.  Some of the boxes <br/>
  we've found were almost visible...a bit a white or blue showing in <br/>
  the rocks and looking out of place from the trail...covering debris <br/>
  looking very out of place in the surrounding landscape.  These could <br/>
  have been seen, discovered and maybe trashed by the "uneducated" <br/>
  (and we made an effort to solve this problem with extra leaves and <br/>
  such).  However, they could have lead to new letterboxers who asked <br/>
  the question upon finding them, "what is this letterboxing thing?"<br/>
  Some missing boxes might be "missing" because someone who found them <br/>
  took it upon themselves to take them home and replace wet items.  Of <br/>
  the nine we've found so far, at least 3 were pretty moist and could <br/>
  probably have used some attention from the planter...so e-mail <br/>
  contact info is a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
  Here's an analogy for you to ponder...<br/>
  My wife and I work at a store.  The store is publicly known of.  <br/>
  People come to the store and most of them use if for what it is <br/>
  inteded...a place to buy things they want.  Others, however, and a <br/>
  small percentage at that, do cause problems, make messes, steal and <br/>
  in general disturb our lives.  Its like this with anything.  These <br/>
  people are people after all, so what did you expect?  Life goes <br/>
  on...don't let them ruin it for you/us...replant!<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for reading this...and thanks for planting boxes.  Hopefully, <br/>
  we'll start our own plantings in the spring.<br/>
<br/>
