and to those who put out boxes for the day.  They were all fun to find, <br/>
and  to  oh and ah over the stamps.  The day was perfect, food was too <br/>
and the raffle was the best ., even though my numbers were not called,  <br/>
I enjoyed the fun of seeing happy faces everywhere. !  Can't wait to see <br/>
some of the pictures.  thanks Music Woman for taking that group picture  <br/>
We will need a very wide angle lens one of these gathers.<br/>

<br/>
OT: Some of us poor souls can't afford a nice digital 11-28 lens (which on a digital camera would still come in wide angle.... for those of you who have digital SLR's and have used regular SLR lenses with your digital, you know what I mean ;-).  I'm still using the SLR lenses from my old Nikon SLR.<br/>

the Manchester Winter gather. What fun! My daughter and I enjoyed seeing everyone and <br/>
meeting new people. <br/>
   A special thanks to Stephanie of Pointer party for giving us our tour. Now, I look at <br/>
hiding boxes in a whole new light. In fact "box" don't seem to be the appropriate word! <br/>
And Music Woman gave a great demo on carving, especially the transfer technique. Our <br/>
iron just broke so I can't wait to get a new one and give it a try!.<br/>
   Aren't we lucky that we're not just a virtual community but a real one to boot. And full of <br/>
such exceptional people! Connecticut's lucky to have such a talented bunch living there. <br/>
<br/>
   I hope to return to CT this Spring and hit the trails but I'm afraid I'll never get back home <br/>
once I start!!!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>
My first stop will be Avon, my childhood hometown!<br/>
