                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-462278447">We tackled the epic hike today. 6 1/2 hours in Bigelow Hollow and <br/>
Nipmuck SF. 11 miles,  6 boxes, 1 hitch hiker, and we're exhausted. <br/>
What an incredible hike. If you can swing a full day hiking, go for <br/>
it!   We liked how you came back by the car from time to time, makes <br/>
for a nice central area to eat lunch and hit the little hiker's room. <br/>
<br/>
The scenery was incredible. The terrain tough at times. Its a perfect <br/>
hike with places to linger, Maddie got lots of swims in, and we just <br/>
cannot rave enough about what a fun day we had! All 5 of Jay's boxes <br/>
and Lenny /Kathy's Maine State Stamp were in excellent shape. Picked <br/>
up the Ebenexer Tuttle HH and will move it south a ways. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the placers! What fun!<br/>
