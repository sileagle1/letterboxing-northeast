series.  I need to know specifically which ones are missing.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can e-mail me offline and let me know between now and <br/>
tomorrow, that would be great, since I'm going to replace some of them <br/>
tomorrow after school.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

underway for many weeks, spearheaded by Pine Tree, to revive and <br/>
revitalize Carolyn Stearn's [Leader of the Pack] letterboxes. Carolyn <br/>
was instrumental in introducing letterboxing to the Mansfield area in <br/>
the late 1990's and early 2000, thus influencing and encouraging <br/>
planting in other parts of the state.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who has any information of ANY of her boxes, please contact <br/>
Pine Tree on this list.<br/>
<br/>
Kudos to Pine Tree and her crew for their efforts in their maintenance <br/>
project to preserve these early CT boxes from one of our state's <br/>
pioneers. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to you all!!!<br/>
