word that there is a missing stethoscope out on Higby Mountain.  It <br/>
belongs to a Middlefield Firefighter/EMT who was out there two weeks <br/>
ago on a Monday night during a drill.  He isn't sure at what point <br/>
along the trail he lost it.  They were doing a rescue drill and <br/>
getting the new firefighters familiar with the area in case they <br/>
needed to go up there again.  You can contact me if you find it.<br/>
Any help would be appreciated.<br/>
