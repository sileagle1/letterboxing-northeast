State forest in Wendell, Ma. tomorrow (Saturday). They are expecting <br/>
around 300 people to attend and there is even going to be a radio <br/>
station broadcasting live at the event. I know there are a lot of <br/>
letterboxes there. Hopefully they will be ok. Those who have boxes in <br/>
the area may want to check up on them after the event. You can read <br/>
about it at <br/>
