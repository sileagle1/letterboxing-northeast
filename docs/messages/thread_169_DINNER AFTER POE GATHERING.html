</span></blockquote>mmmm, honestly can't remember it, and Rt 9 is the only road I <br/>
know 'fairly' well. How long ago were you there last?  There is <br/>
a "JP's" on the corner of 135 and 9..strategically well placed, <br/>
which I think I remember is a great spot to gather, although I <br/>
thought I might visit it this Sunday (gotta watch the game somewhere <br/>
right??!) before I commit. I called them and while they don't take <br/>
reservations, they said "Come on Down! We'd love to have you! 20 <br/>
something people shouldn't be a problem on a Sunday afternoon."   <br/>
The Naked Fish is excellent,and one of my favorites, but a little <br/>
higher on the "real nice restaurant" list than I had in mind. I was <br/>
thinking more along the casual line.. yaknowwhatImean?</div>

AHEM! <br/>
sorry for the diversion, you've got me drooling now! I'd settle for a<br/>
casual atmosphere as well. After gathering dinner is definitely a<br/>
priority for us as we'll be on the road from Maine and en route to CT<br/>
afterwards. See you folks then!</div>

</span></blockquote>As a first generation Cuban American, I can tell you that their food <br/>
is authentic!  But I agree, it is pricey and always crowded.  We <br/>
would definitely need to make a HUGE reservation if that's the place <br/>
we pick.<br/>

The Matador.<br/>
