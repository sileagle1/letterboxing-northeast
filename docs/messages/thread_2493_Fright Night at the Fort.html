Boch's Circus was in town right through to the costume contest, fun was the key to the <br/>
day! Fort McClary was a great spot, loaded with history. I've lived a 1/2 hour away for over <br/>
20 years and have never been there. With all the stone walls and granite blocks it was the <br/>
ideal spot to play hide and seek!<br/>
<br/>
    I brought along several of my family members (new boxers) and they had a great day as <br/>
well. The people were friendly, the food was delicious and the event boxes were clever. <br/>
There are some pretty talented up and coming carvers out there!<br/>
<br/>
   So to Maine Kopellian, Oceanwytch, Cooties, The End and all involved- a big thanks for a <br/>
job well done!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion</div>
