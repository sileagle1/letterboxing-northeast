Today would have been the PERFECT day to go box the new boxes in Bristol.  I <br/>
ended up getting an early dismissal from my school in Bristol today and <br/>
would have had plenty of time to grab the boxes before the snow started <br/>
falling.  Seems as though all of the new boxes show up after I've been in <br/>
the area.....Figures..... LOL<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully I'll get more time in May when there's more daylight to grab the <br/>
boxes!  C'est La Vie!<br/>
