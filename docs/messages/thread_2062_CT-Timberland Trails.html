and well.  Just follow the clues to the spots described and you'll <br/>
find a prize!  The Hideout series of three is also in great shape.  A <br/>
bit of planning with a trail map can get all 6 of these at the same <br/>
time as well as Timberland Tiger.  It's a 3 hour trek, but definitely <br/>
worth it.  The property is fabulous!!! Happy Boxing Everyone-Sunshine, <br/>
