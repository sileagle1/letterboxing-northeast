Subject: [LbNA] A+ hitchhhiker. ......... ..sound familiar to any HH<br/>
<br/>
placer?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This hitchhiker has been travelling since <a href="mailto:annino@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">annino@...</a> placed it in August<br/>
<br/>
of 2004.  The placer left a note on the cover to the logbook saying "please<br/>
<br/>
keep me in CT."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, it's come a long way from Connecticut.  In July of 2008, it was found<br/>
<br/>
in a Massachusetts letterbox, and from there, there's absolutely no<br/>
<br/>
indication as to how it ended up in Wheaton, IL, a suburb of Chicago.<br/>
<br/>
Unless it was the folks who found it in MA and they moved it from MA to IL.<br/>
<br/>
There are no stamps in it after their stamp.  I just found it today in a<br/>
<br/>
Wheaton, IL letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At some point, the stamp was obviously lost, and a kind soul name<br/>
<br/>
"Confederate" recarved it.  The logbook says that he/she found it without a<br/>
<br/>
stamp at Quenticut Letterbox in April of 2006.  So from August 2004 to April<br/>
<br/>
2006, it had the original stamp and from April 2006 to July 2009, it's had<br/>
<br/>
Confederate' s stamp.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So anyway...... ......... .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There's a request on the logbook cover by the placer saying they want the HH<br/>
<br/>
to remain in CT.  It definitely ain't in CT.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone recognizes who <a href="mailto:annino@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">annino@...</a> is, please tell them to get in touch<br/>
<br/>
with me if they want the HH mailed back to them so they can re-place it in<br/>
<br/>
CT.  There's no name.  Just the email addy asking folks to contact them if<br/>
<br/>
they find the HH and a carving of a fish.  It doesn't have many stamps in it<br/>
<br/>
for having been travelling since 2004, but it has some nice ones.  It's a<br/>
<br/>
small stamp but a large logbook, so I can imagine that it was hard at times<br/>
<br/>
to find a letterbox that it would fit into.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The email bounced right back to me.  Can't find any record of the HH on<br/>
<br/>
atlasquest.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll wait a couple of weeks, then if I've heard nothing, I'll just move it<br/>
<br/>
on.<br/>
