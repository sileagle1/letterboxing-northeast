  Love these June evenings! We had light until 8ish and were able to go after the north half of "Up North/Down South" at the Carolina Management Area. I'm really getting to like that area for hiking.<br/>
  The box is alive and well. <br/>
  We had the clues to "bobbin' bobber" in the notebook and decide to check to see if we could locate it. It's still there and hadn't been visited in over a year. Imagine when Wanda and Pete only had 1214 finds!  What a lovely spot the Carolina Trout Pond is! <br/>
