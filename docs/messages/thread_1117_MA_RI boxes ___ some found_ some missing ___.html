shape.  We were lucky enough to be the first finder for 2 of them, <br/>
raising our first finder count to 4!<br/>
<br/>
Otis Smith Farm (Cumberland, RI)<br/>
Wandering Bird and Catch a Falling Star (Franklin, MA)<br/>
Old Landing (Marion, MA)<br/>
Pratt Farm and Oliver Mill (Middleborough, MA)<br/>
<br/>
We attempted to hunt for some of the Scout Law Series, but weren't <br/>
very successful with the first one we went after ... the first one, <br/>
Trustworthy, is said to be in the "Veronica Geddes Bowen Wildlife <br/>
Preserve", "0.5 miles" on Angell Road (from Mendon Road).  At 0.5 <br/>
miles, however, we saw no trails or mention of a preserve, just <br/>
houses.  We asked a couple of locals and they had not heard of the <br/>
preserve either.  A check of our Gazetter yielded nothing <br/>
either.  ???  We haven't contacted the placer yet.  Has anyone found <br/>
this first box?  If so, what did we miss?<br/>
<br/>
We also went after the Diamond Hill letterboxes, but the Cumberland <br/>
Fest was going on at the park and there was no way to get to the <br/>
boxes -- even if we paid the admission to get into the fair.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the Almost Last but Not Least letterbox in Woonsocket, RI <br/>
appears MIA.  We're contacting the placer to determine if is missing <br/>
or if we missed something, so it's status is not yet confirmed.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of bad luck continued for us Saturday as we hunted boxes in <br/>
southern MA.  We couldn't get near some of the Seaside Series boxes <br/>
as there were too many people around blocking the box or beacuse we <br/>
were unable to park (many areas required a resident sticker).<br/>
<br/>
We did hunt the Dunseith Gardens and Island Wharf letterboxes, both <br/>
part of the series, and found both to be missing.  Again, we have <br/>
not contacted the placers yet and could have simply missed them.  We <br/>
did get one box from the series (The Seaside Series II, actually) -- <br/>
Old Landing.<br/>
<br/>
Work has been incredibly busy so I have not had time to update our <br/>
website with any stories of our finds yet, but I will soon.  And, <br/>
lastly, because of other commitments and a lack of time, the <br/>
finishing touches on one of the two boxes we're placing has not been <br/>
completed -- and the placement of those two boxes remains delayed <br/>
despite my telling all of you that we will be placing them soon.  <br/>
Well, that's true, we will be placing them soon -- and, I promise, <br/>
soon means before Labor Day.  We'll let you know!<br/>

Hi All -<br/>
 We have just recently discovered this LbNE Yahoo group.  We have <br/>
been letterboxing for about a year now, but 'casually' : we don't go <br/>
out every weekend, we didn't carve our own stamps, we don't keep <br/>
close count of what we have found ( altho everything is stamped in <br/>
our logbook ), we forget to exchange stamps with people whom we have <br/>
introduced to letterboxing.....we just like the hiking so much and we <br/>
love discovering new places and finding boxes...there are so many <br/>
things we would never have seen, if we were not out there, <br/>
letterboxing!!<br/>
 We tried to find Dunseith Gardens, in July and were not successful. <br/>
We tend to think this is because we don't look hard enough.  Now we <br/>
don't feel too badly, since it seems to be actually missing.  There <br/>
was no response to our attempt to contact the placer.<br/>
 We are off to Ogunquit ME for three days at the end of this month <br/>
and look forward to some nearby letterboxes there. Any ideas?<br/>
Be Having Fun,<br/>
