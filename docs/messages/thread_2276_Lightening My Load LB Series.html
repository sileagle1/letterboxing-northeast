Geez, Deanne, you cannot possibly live up to your trail name!  That hike was a real workout, with downhill slopes, an uphill to an observation tower, then down a STEEP trail, only to climb gradually all the way to the end!  Don't let this deter you, though, because the trail was clearly marked, the clues were excellent, the stamps were all hand-carved, and the story to tie the stamps together was enjoyable and entertaining.  I highly recommend it!  Keep 'em coming!<br/>
