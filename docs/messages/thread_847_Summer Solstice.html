Tomorrow is the day offering the most daylight hours in the entire <br/>
year. Hard to imagine, but after tomorrow we actually start slowly <br/>
losing daylight hours, minute by minute. It is my last day of school <br/>
and things have been exciting right up to the end, so it'll be a long <br/>
day for me ;-) Perhaps, just perhaps, I can get home, unpack my <br/>
bookbag and sneak out for just one..or two..or three letterboxes. <br/>
Welcome to the official start of summer, my letterboxing companions.<br/>

  Am I ever envious of you!  My school doesn't let out until next Monday the 28th.  Everyone, kids and teachers are ready for the break.  Hope you had time to find a few boxes!<br/>
