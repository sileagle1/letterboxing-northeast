<br/>
Does anyone have saved (or know how to obtain) the clues for the "old" (Centennial Series) DEP LB's?<br/>
<br/>
Specifically, I am interested in the #10 (Nepaug S.F.) box, in an effort to "re-find" the Nepaug Series boxes whose clues start from the Centennial Series #10. It is too beautiful a park not to keep these boxes in action!<br/>
<br/>
Had a great time finding the "new" (Seedling Series) #10 box, and participated in our first exchange today! Happy Independence Day to one and all!<br/>

PS - Replies directly to me at <a href="mailto:dthreedvm01@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dthreedvm01@...</a> are probably best in order to limit unnecessary inbox filling of non-CT LB'ers. Muchas gracias!<br/>
<br/>
PPS - Does anyone else get mildly annoyed by personal replies that go out to the entire group? Apologies in advance if this newbie is the only one who is!!!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Specifically, I am interested in the #10 (Nepaug S.F.) box, in an <br/>
&gt;effort to "re-find" the Nepaug Series boxes whose clues start from <br/>
&gt;the Centennial Series #10. It is too beautiful a park not to keep <br/>
&gt;these boxes in action!<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Here are our suggestions. You can use these in conjunction with the <br/>
clues to the current DEP box and the series to (hopefully) find all <br/>
the Nepaug Series boxes! The DEP box used to be much closer to the <br/>
parking lot and was moved when they updated it with the new stamp.<br/>
<br/>
  - Follow the clue for the DEP Nepaug State Forest box, but stop <br/>
right before the power line cut -- box #2 is on the left side of the <br/>
trail before the cut. (Note: The trail here is the Tipping Rock Loop <br/>
of the Tunxis Trail -- the CT Forest &amp; Parks Association was to add <br/>
colored dots to the light blue blazes on the side trails in Nepaug in <br/>
preparation for the release of the new CT Walk Book, but they haven't <br/>
yet done this trail when we were there, so I can't say what color the <br/>
dot may be!)<br/>
<br/>
  - Continue to the DEP box.<br/>
<br/>
  - Continue to box #3.<br/>
<br/>
  - Now, return the way you came, back on the trail to the road, and <br/>
turn right. (This is the blue-blazed Tunxis Trail.) Follow the trail <br/>
blazes on the road and go left at the first intersection. Continue to <br/>
follow the blue blazes along that road to the next intersection. This <br/>
is the "Y in the road" in the clue. The tree just to the left of the <br/>
rocks rocks now has a dark blue blaze on it, and there is another <br/>
trail to the left of the tree/rocks, you need to take the trail <br/>
between the two rocks to the right of the tree. This trail was easy <br/>
to see and follow up the hill now, but that may change in the summer <br/>
when the grass grows up.<br/>
<br/>
  - After finding box #1, just continue on that trail -- there are <br/>
now no downed trees blocking the path. When you get to the forest <br/>
road, turn right and follow it down to the parking area.<br/>
<br/>
We did email this note to the planter but they never responded. If <br/>
you have any updates to these notes, let me know, and I'll see if I <br/>
can't get a note added to the clue on the letterboxing.org web site.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
