<br/>
     The Chicken Cows was at the Pirate from Every Port gathering <br/>
today.  He left his exchange book on our table.  We went out boxing <br/>
and arrived back after dark and everything had been packed up.  If you <br/>
are holding it for him, please contact me(his Mom). <br/>
     The first page of the book has exchanges with Mumma &amp; Bunny Boy, <br/>
Chunna, Cape Cod Letter Boxer, Cape Cod Lightning Bug and Archimedes <br/>
Screw.  His last exchange was with Wanda and he will be very sad if it <br/>
is lost.  Please let us know!  His name is not on the book and it is a <br/>
small spiral mead.<br/>
Thanks to everyone at the gathering.  What a great time!<br/>
<br/>
