</span></blockquote>Oh, my, yes! My daughter and I have been reading about LBing for some <br/>
time and had done all of 4 boxes - one close enough to us, 3 on <br/>
vacation - but live in an area that only now seems to be discovering <br/>
LBing..... (I'm hoping to plant a whole bunch this spring and see if <br/>
that has the desired effect. lol)<br/>
<br/>
Sooooo, we had been debating whether or not to head to Mansfield since <br/>
we had a long weekend. When Fisher and Family sent a list email asking <br/>
if anyone with kids wanted to LB, we jumped at the chance.<br/>
<br/>
First, a HUGE thanks to Fisher and her lovely kids. We had an absolute <br/>
ball and she was a real help with directions, restaurant suggestions, <br/>
and even driving the whole gang around.<br/>
<br/>
Pre-Mansfield - HH(ours) 3, HH(found) 1, PLB 3, F4<br/>
<br/>
Post-Mansfield!!!! - HH(ours) 7, HH(found) 1, PLB 3, X 14, F 30!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I mean, when CT people talk about stumbling over LBs while mowing their <br/>
lawns, they ain't just Whistlin' Dixie! We found one box simply by <br/>
looking back up at a hill we'd just come down and seeing what looked to <br/>
be a hiding place. It about killed me thinking about all of the boxes <br/>
that we were probably walking right by...... but it was great to meet <br/>
Fisher and everyone else who was out on the trails.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, a quick list of the boxes we found - almost all were in great <br/>
condition. No major problems with any of them, except the ones we <br/>
couldn't find. ;-)<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1467747137">I have decided I love the Mansfield area.  The parks and land trusts are plenty and very nice.  The trails are almost always found pristine.  Some of the places Dan and I went to over this past weekend were the kind that have you saying, "Oh, let's come back here again."  We didn't run into a lot of people on the trail but we saw a lot of cars at the trail heads and did one stamp exchange on the trail.  We enjoyed having a bite to eat at the general store while stamping in.  We watched 2 people hunting around the chicken's roost while we ate, so we invited them to sit with us.  We have only gotten about 22 of the MMM boxes and we hope to go back and get them all.<br/>
<br/>
The stamps have been very impressive, too.<br/>
