<br/>
May 15, 2010<br/>
<br/>
St. Thomas, Ontario<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please join us for a day or two or three --<br/>
whichever works for you. We promise to keep you entertained and letterboxing in<br/>
some very beautiful areas including Downtown St. Thomas, Old Talbot Street,<br/>
Pinafore Park and areas further afield.<br/>
<br/>
We will be introducing a new series of boxes representing Heritage<br/>
Trees at this meet up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
TREES<br/>
<br/>
I think that I shall never see<br/>
<br/>
A poem lovely as a tree<br/>
<br/>
A tree whose hungry mouth is<br/>
pressed<br/>
<br/>
Against the earth's sweet flowing breast;<br/>
<br/>
A tree that looks at God all day<br/>
<br/>
And lifts her leafy arms to pray,<br/>
<br/>
A tree that may in summer wear<br/>
<br/>
A nest of robins in her hair<br/>
<br/>
Upon whose blossom snow has lain; <br/>
<br/>
Who intimately lives with rain.<br/>
<br/>
Poems were made by fools like me<br/>
<br/>
But only God can make a tree.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce Kilmer<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Schedule of Events:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
11 am: Registration at Pinafore Park, swaps,<br/>
goodie bags <br/>
<br/>
12 pm: Pot luck lunch, group photo, and then off letterboxing<br/>
<br/>
7 pm: Supper and social at a local restaurant (location will be determined when we know how<br/>
many people will be coming)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Last year’s Musical Mystery Tour boxes (a walking<br/>
tour of downtown St. Thomas) are still active but with some changes, as well as<br/>
the Pinafore Park boxes.  The Dalewood/Waterworks<br/>
area boxes will be re-planted before the meet-up  (They were pulled for the winter).  And we will be introducing a new series<br/>
representing Heritage trees.<br/>
<br/>
Clue packages<br/>
will be provided when your team registers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to plant letterboxes while you<br/>
are visiting us, we would be absolutely thrilled.<br/>
<br/>
