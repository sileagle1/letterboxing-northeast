The groom is doing very well but the poor bride is a bit worse for <br/>
wear. No log book, the box was a frozen lump and she was incased in a <br/>
sheet of ice. We carefully thawed her out enough to stamp in but didn't <br/>
have a spare log book with us to leave. She's safely back in the wall <br/>
in a new baggie for those who want to find her, some of the clues have <br/>
disappeared but a bit of sleuthing will do the trick.<br/>
