Pt Judith Letterbox was in tough shape.<br/>
<br/>
As the maintainer, I went down today and restored it with fresh new <br/>
double ziplocked bags and a new container.<br/>
<br/>
No damage was done to the logbook or the stamp, but the proximity of <br/>
this letterbox to a nearby geocache creates a lot of non-boxing <br/>
inquisitiveness, and the box gets much non-boxing wear and tear.<br/>
<br/>
This is my third restoration in the last year!  But the box is worth <br/>
keeping as Mad Mary (the original placer) is a great carver.<br/>
