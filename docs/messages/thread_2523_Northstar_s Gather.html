hope you're leaving the boxes out for more boxers to get them.  they <br/>
are all worthy of hanging around.  You did alot of work in a short <br/>
time and we totally appreciate your efforts.  ToadDog is on the couch, <br/>
comatose, he's so tired. We check him for a pulse now and then, so far <br/>
so good.  We of course are ready for another hike,yeah right!-we're <br/>
pooped, too! It was great seeing everyone.  I've seen that tower since <br/>
my childhood when visiting relatives in Simsbury- it was such <br/>
a "high"(get it?) to actually be there. Kudos!! Sunshine and her <br/>
boys :0)</div>
