                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1737776874">We visited this box yesterday and it was fine.  It had been left out on the steps with a small piece of concrete on it. We placed it back on the left-hand side of the stairs under vines.  This looked to be where it belonged.  We didn't want to place it too low for fear that the tide would get into it, but we didn't want to leave it sitting on the steps either.<br/>
