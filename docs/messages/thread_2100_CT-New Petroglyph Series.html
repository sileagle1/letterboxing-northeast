well, and all boxes were found!!  the stamps are outstanding- they <br/>
make a wonderful grouping in our logbook.  Many thanks for the <br/>
beautiful First Finder's Certificate, too!! We couldn't believe that <br/>
we were first-WooHoo!!!  It is well worth the 6 mile hike. I even saw <br/>
a wildflower that I'd never seen before.  Wanda joined up with us when <br/>
we met at the middle of the trek.  She identified the plant as <br/>
Indian's cucumber.  It had a unique arrangment of leaves and a very <br/>
small, green flower.  Neat!!! Happy Memorial Day everyone and Happy <br/>
Boxing!! Sunshine, Swamp Yankee and the very tired ToadDog  :0)</div>
