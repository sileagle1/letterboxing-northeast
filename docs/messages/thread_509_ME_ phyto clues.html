I am about to make a shocking statement. I will be pulling all my clue links from <br/>
the main LBNA webpage soon. This means that you will only be able to access my <br/>
clues from our home gwi.net page. I will most likely leave up the adopted boxes <br/>
under the name "phyto" however I might also make a link for that on our page.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you wondering why I opted to do this, there are many reasons. First <br/>
and foremost because I enjoy having complete creative control over my clues if I <br/>
want to add images and links. Secondly because as demonstrated today, there are <br/>
times when access to the clues via the main letterboxing north america page might <br/>
be limited.  <br/>
<br/>
So, until further notice, if you notice a steep drop in the number of boxes in maine, <br/>
they will be moved over to our home page. In five years I would like to compile our <br/>
clues into printed-only bound book format and in that case you may opt to be put <br/>
on my mailing list to receive clues.<br/>
<br/>
Questions? - email me OFF LIST thanks! :-)<br/>
