week in Ogunquit, Maine from August 10-16.  We are bringing dozens of <br/>
letterbox clues that you Maine boxers have so generously created and <br/>
posted.  Thanks in advance for the fun we know we'll have rediscovering <br/>
Maine as we seek your letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
As a thank you, we plan to leave a few boxes in Maine for your <br/>
letterboxing pleasure.  They will be orphans, at least until we can get <br/>
back in a couple of years to check on them.  Please treat them kindly <br/>
and let us know if any go missing.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
