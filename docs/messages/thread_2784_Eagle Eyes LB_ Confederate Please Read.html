&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've been trying to get a message to you about the Eagle Eyes LB but<br/>
&gt; I'm having computer issues, especially with Atlasquest.  I also tried<br/>
&gt; to "contact placer" via: LbNA.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On Fri., 24th.March I found the LB.  The box was well hidden but there<br/>
&gt; was no stamp pad, and the log was wet.  The stamp is fine.  Someone had<br/>
&gt; placed a bag, with a few index cards cut in half, as a replacement log<br/>
&gt; (?).  These were in the box with the stamp, while the original log in<br/>
&gt; its bag was ON TOP of the tupperware with everything tucked inside a<br/>
&gt; Gal. ziplock.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I have the log and have dried it out.  I plan on replacing it<br/>
&gt; in the LB on Monday.  I hope you don't mind that I took it for first<br/>
&gt; aid.  If you want to contact me, try my cell Phone:  1860.794.5020 best<br/>
&gt; way to reach me.<br/>
