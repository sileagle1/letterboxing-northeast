week. On the way back up to Bangor, with a picturesque Maine harbor sunset, we <br/>
stopped to visit Andre the Seal. Though our spot was lightly covered with snow, we <br/>
still managed to find and stamp into this sweet little box! <br/>
<br/>
What a nice place to view the old lime kilns and see Rockport Harbor out of season. <br/>
The afternoon sunlight made the granite rocks along the ocean water glow with a <br/>
strangely orange hue. Contrast this with a "Parrish Blue" sky, it was just gorgeous.<br/>
<br/>
Classic Maine...<br/>
