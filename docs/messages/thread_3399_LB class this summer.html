I am looking for a volunteer to teach an introductary class on <br/>
letterboxing at the Audubon Center in Glastonbury, CT.  We had a class <br/>
there a few years ago and it was quite a success.  <br/>
<br/>
We have a classroom for up to 20 people, and a park with five boxes <br/>
already.  We are thinking of an indoor presentation followed by a walk <br/>
to search for the boxes in the park.  Probably a Saturday or Sunday in <br/>
June through August.<br/>
<br/>
If you could help us, email me off line and we can get together.<br/>
Thanks<br/>

I was an instructor for a variety of grad school courses  while I was earning my degree.  I look forward to talking with you!!<br/>
