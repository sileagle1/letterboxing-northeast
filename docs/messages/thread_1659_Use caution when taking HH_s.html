box where there was a HH.  The name of it was new to us, so we <br/>
excitedly opened the bag to check it out.  When we opened the <br/>
logbook, we were already stamped in as the first finders and we <br/>
recognized it as a box we'd been to.  We didn't look at the stamp <br/>
because we thought the placers had decided to make their permanent <br/>
box into a HH.  I emailed them when we got home to ask about it and <br/>
found out that they hadn't done any such thing!!!  Fortunately the <br/>
box where we found it was very near our house, so I went back and <br/>
retrieved it.  The stamp is, indeed, from a HH that we had never <br/>
found.  I'm meeting the placer tomorrow to get things back in order, <br/>
since he went to his box and found the right stamp, but wrong <br/>
logbook!!  It's just lucky that we don't live very far from each <br/>
other, and the home of the permanent box is also close by.  This is <br/>
not meant to flame ANYONE, but just to remind us all to take an extra <br/>
second to make sure you're doing what you mean to do!!! Happy Boxing <br/>
