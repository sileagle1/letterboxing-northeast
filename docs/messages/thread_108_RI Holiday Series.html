Wanda's Holiday Series Letterboxes.  While treking in Arcadia, a  <br/>
park ranger stopped me and made it very clear that in RI all outdoors <br/>
people have to wear blaze orange during the hunting season. As I was <br/>
signing in on the third micro box of the angel series Grady &amp; I met a <br/>
couple horseback riding and not only did the riders wear orange but <br/>
the horses had orange saddle pads on.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great new year<br/>
