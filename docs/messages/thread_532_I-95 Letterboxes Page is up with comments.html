<br/>
I have added some comments to the I-95 boxes so that you may better <br/>
understand the length of time you will need to commit to these boxes. <br/>
Hope this is helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Steve, of Steve &amp; Heidi fame, for your suggestions and all <br/>
of the many boxers who have emailed box suggestions!<br/>
<br/>
Please email me with other boxes or your comments. There are still a <br/>
few blank states that need some boxes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
<br/>

   Excellent job on the 2nd draft!  I definately think we needed to <br/>
qualify these box listings.  When we travel long distance we like to <br/>
stop once in a while and a short walk or drive-by is a good idea. <br/>
Perhaps a 1/2 hour lunch break hiking is in order once in a while <br/>
too. Our concern was simple: You could very easily get caught up <br/>
letterboxing and veer way off your travelling game plan!  <br/>
<br/>
For those who will be suggesting boxes, here's a good rule of thumb.  <br/>
Driveby's rule when travelling, but also consider places of <br/>
significance to that specific area. I.E. in South Eastern CT you <br/>
would probably suggest Captain's Walk, Fort Griswold, and Fort <br/>
Trumbull as must-haves for the I-95 traveller. These boxes have <br/>
meaning to this are and make for a fine representation of our neck of <br/>
the woods. They can all be done, including getting off and back on <br/>
the highway in a matter of 20 minutes. <br/>
<br/>
We'll be travelling to S.C. for 4th of July week and look forward to <br/>
finding some boxes and learning about the areas we travel through! <br/>
Thanks again for all the hard work : ) <br/>
<br/>
-Steve, Heidi, and Madras<br/>
