is heading to do that letterbox, the Pink Flower Letterbox is in the <br/>
same general area.<br/>
<br/>
I saw some definate signs of spring today.  While checking on the <br/>
Pink Flower LB, I heard the wonderful sound of wood <br/>
frogs "quacking".  The observation platform along the trail was the <br/>
perfect place to listen and spot these harbingers of spring (also <br/>
means that there is a vernal pool there...time to dust off my vernal <br/>
pool certification stuff, its that time of the year again!!!). <br/>
<br/>
And then, while placing the Grouchy Cat LB, I spotted a garter snake <br/>
basking on the rocks at the first stream crossing.  I grabbed him <br/>
right behind the head to get a closer look but then he did something <br/>
that most garter snakes do when bothered...peed.  Yuck!  I hate that <br/>
smell!  I quickly let him go and rinsed my hands in the stream.  <br/>
Aaahhhh, the wonders of nature!<br/>
<br/>
Get out there, box, and enjoy the spring weather!</div>
