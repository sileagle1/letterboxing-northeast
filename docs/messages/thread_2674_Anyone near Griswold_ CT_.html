Hi, my name is Ida Parker. I am working with the National Wild Turkey<br/>
Federation to provide a day of activities for women. This day will be<br/>
held on Saturday, April 1, 2006, at the Pachuag Outdoor CLub in<br/>
Griswold, CT. The day goes from 8am to 4pm. I am looking for someone<br/>
to come and share the Letterboxing exprience. Maybe even set up a<br/>
Letterbox on the club grounds for the women to find that day.<br/>
Do you know someone who would be willing to do this?<br/>
<br/>
You an reach me at 860-376-0816 or email me at <a href="mailto:justmeinvltwn@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">justmeinvltwn@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time.<br/>
Sincerely,Ida Parker<br/>
<br/>

Any volunteers? =) They're ASKING to have letterboxes on their property!<br/>
