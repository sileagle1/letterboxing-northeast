letterboxes, I signed up with geocaching.com so I can use their <br/>
website.  The free option gives me everything I need.  By looking at <br/>
the maps and calling up the cache details you can get a link to the <br/>
placer's profile.  There you can email the placer<br/>
<br/>
I have done this with the caches that were near to my boxes, and <br/>
they all responded positively.  They were aware of the difference <br/>
between caches and boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
I also have a GPS receiver and try to separate my boxes 300 ft or <br/>
more from the nearest cache.<br/>
