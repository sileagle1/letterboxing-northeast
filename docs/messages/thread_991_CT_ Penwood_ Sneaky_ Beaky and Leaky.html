 I did bring reinforcements (aka my friend Chong), who has a firearm and <br/>
permit and is not afraid to use it, but he forgot it at home..... LOL  So much for <br/>
bringing people for protection :-)... Of course, bringing in firearms into a <br/>
state park would probably be illegal anyway!<br/>
