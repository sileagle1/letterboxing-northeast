<br/>
Chrissy (aka Brandy) and I were stamping into the box in the car when two DOT trucks came into the parking lot and took a LONG coffee break (well, for one guy, it was technically a smoke break, but you get the idea).  They wouldn't leave, we didn't want to endanger the box and Chrissy and I had to get home, so I currently have the box in my car.<br/>
<br/>
I was going to send it to Sweet Pea, but she has told me that she won't have time to replant it any time soon.... SOOOOOO...... It will stay in my car until the middle of next week, which is when I'll be back in the area again (as long as it doesn't snow!).<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to those who may be out looking for it... and I WILL get it back in place soon!<br/>
