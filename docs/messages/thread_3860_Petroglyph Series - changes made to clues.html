 <br/>
I was not able to to take care of missing box and clue changes until today.  Healing Hands are now in a new location and a second logbook has been placed in the last box as the other was full.  The clues are updated with a few minor changes so please print the clues again if you are planning on doing this series.  Thank you all for your kind words in the first logbook.  The visitors enjoyed their hike - even the ones who were tired out when done.    <br/>
 <br/>
Thank you to those who updated me with changes and info about the condition of the boxes.  Letterboxers are truly amazing people.  I am honored to be a part of this hobby.<br/>
 <br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
