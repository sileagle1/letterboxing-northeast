the Route 302 traffic! The Lakes Region Letterboxing Event was a great<br/>
time had by all - though it was fairly short.<br/>
<br/>
Boxers traveled from as far away as Cape Cod, Rhode Island,<br/>
Massachusettes, and even the Brown Knight and family were in<br/>
attendance all the way from Indiana! It was nice to see new as well as<br/>
familiar faces.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a few of the people that were present:<br/>
Phyto &amp; Isosceles of Bangor, Maine<br/>
Nautilus of Sanford, Maine<br/>
Deb Blanchard of South Portland, Maine<br/>
Team Green Dragon of Taunton, Mass.<br/>
Phynstar of Maine by way of NY.<br/>
Oceanwytch of Portland, Maine<br/>
Dragonfly  of Cape Cod, Mass.<br/>
Team Caffeine of Providence, Rhode Island<br/>
Brown Knight of W. Lafayette, Indiana<br/>
Wanda of Wanda &amp; Pete<br/>
Gryphon of Westbrook, Maine<br/>
Beedle &amp; Mac of Richmond, Maine<br/>
Postal of Edgecomb, Maine<br/>
Uneksia of Hillsboro, NH<br/>
The Dynamic Duo<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure to have missed a few here and there. There were students from<br/>
Deb Blanchard's elementary school classes! There were also plenty of<br/>
nearby boxes to be found - some that I'm sure I even missed. Wanda may<br/>
have been heard saying something to the effect that it was the most<br/>
concentrated number of boxes she's ever found in one area! ??!<br/>
<br/>
For those who boxed afterwards, did anyone try the Holt Pond Preserve<br/>
Porcupine Den? Nautilus, Phyto and Isosceles braved this box, but with<br/>
regrets as Phyto got stung by a hornet. If you attempt this box,<br/>
please confirm that it is present with the placer or preserve. I was<br/>
disappointed to be stung by a hornet on top of not being able to find<br/>
the box. Where on earth does the trail go "up"????<br/>
<br/>
Nice to see some faces again and meet some new folks.<br/>

Wanted to say I had a fantabulous time at the gathering. Thanks so much to <br/>
Deb for organizing the whole thing. In response to the question about the <br/>
Porcupine den, I (Dragonfly) along with Oceanwytch and Gryphon went in search of <br/>
this box after the event, and while there we met Chess Master, Wimpy and   <br/>
Uneskia (of Hillsboro, NH), who were also searching for the box. Unfortunately, even <br/>
with all these boxers, we still came up negative too. Afterwards, we <br/>
caravanned to Crossed Arrows at the Peabody Fitch Nature trail, what an amazing view. <br/>
We found the box, and on our way back to our cars we ran into Team Green <br/>
Dragon, The Dynamic Duo, Binx, Solor and met another letterboxer to exchange with <br/>
Wendy from Narramissic. It was like a post gathering-gathering. How very <br/>
sychronistic. Anyway had a blast and wanted to say Thanks you, it was great to meet <br/>
some of the Letterboxing community!<br/>

Holt Pond Preserve Trail at L.E.A. (Lakes Environmental Association).<br/>
I'm very bummed about that, as I used to work for the Portland Water<br/>
District and was waiting for years to walk on that trail. It didn't<br/>
help that I got stung by the hornet either :-( <br/>
<br/>
We enjoyed meeting you (Dragonfly) and I hope you find the hidden<br/>
homes on Monhegan. You might want to check this out:<br/>
<a href="http://www.oddnewengland.com/state_me/faeries/faeries.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.oddnewengland.com/state_me/faeries/faeries.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
There are also books that have been written about his fantastic place.<br/>
When you plan a trip up to Maine to see the homes, contact myself and<br/>
Isosceles and we can give you some directions and suggestions on other<br/>
boxes to hit along the way! <br/>

was not with the "trailhead kiosk to the right" as the clue<br/>
specifically states. ERghhhhh!!! I was more than a bit frustrated by this.<br/>
<br/>
No cairn either.<br/>
But at that point, we were starting to wonder if the cairn was maybe<br/>
smaller, like the remains of chipmunk munchies, or perhaps a stack of<br/>
fallen leaves, or mushrooms, or something else?! :-)<br/>
<br/>
All in all, still a great area, good hike and wonderful idea - just<br/>
have to actually find the box sometime.<br/>

the trail that we could find, nor could we find evidence of one that was. as<br/>
we were sitting contemplating our dilemma dragonfly and friends (trail names<br/>
are escaping me....it is early can i be forgiven?) came along. we all<br/>
searched again, thinking this might be the spot. no luck. two things, either<br/>
i am just not reading the clues right, or the placer could perhaps check? in<br/>
either case i have not yet given up.... i will be back!<br/>
