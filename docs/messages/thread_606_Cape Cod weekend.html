everyone should try to seize the opportunity to view these fellow <br/>
mammals in their natural habitat. It is awe inspiring to put it <br/>
mildly.<br/>
  Now, on to the topic at hand!!   I found "Stonecroft"..well, let me <br/>
restate that, I found brand new letterboxers, "The Vt. 2" stamping <br/>
into Stonecroft and joined them. This box was their third. On Sat. we <br/>
checked on my "Great Island" letterbox.  It was so nice to see the <br/>
sign-ins of visiters.  On Sun. I found "Tandem Mates", part of a <br/>
series on the Cape Cod Rail Trail for bikers and hikers. I had gotten <br/>
one other stamp from the series last year. Now, have found all th <br/>
eWellfleet area boxes except "Long Pond" one.  Driving directions to <br/>
the site are not working out as spelled out. Would have been great to <br/>
run into Camera Obsura at Nickerson. Clues were printed out but we <br/>
chose to linger at the beach before heading back to CT. <br/>
