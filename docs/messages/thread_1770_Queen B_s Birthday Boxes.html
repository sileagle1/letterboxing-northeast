boxes. She gave me the clues today and we went to find them. She did <br/>
a wonderful job in creating the clues and carving the stamps. The <br/>
pansies have a special place in my heart, and were an emotionally <br/>
pleasant surprise. Thanks also to Butterfly for the added pleasure of <br/>
falling leaves. When these clues are posted, which I believe will be <br/>
within a day or two, be sure to make the trip to get the boxes. They <br/>
are terrific!!!<br/>
