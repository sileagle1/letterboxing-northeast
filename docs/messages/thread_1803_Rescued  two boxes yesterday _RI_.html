walking to it I could clearly see it from a distance. The person who <br/>
was there last was a nonboxer and had written that they thought it <br/>
was a box of weed(?), if they meant the kind that you smoke I didn't <br/>
know the locals hid it in tupperware. I placed the box behind the <br/>
rock and it is no longer visible. <br/>
    Next I went to find the Few, the Proud. I found the Grey Owl HH, <br/>
of the critter racing fame, with his feathers so ruffled, I guess <br/>
cause he's stuck in RI, that he'd popped the lid clean off the box. <br/>
Good thing I got him out of there before the rain, snow, and sleet <br/>
that's expected to fall on that very special box tomorrow. I had to <br/>
take grey owl home with me cause the other boxes that I visited that <br/>
day weren't large enough to house the poor critter but I did promise <br/>
him a trip to CT after the storm and he's really happy about that.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Thanks, that is my box - and yes, it could have the potential to be<br/>
easily spotted if not hidden well. Ah, the hazards of urban boxing in<br/>
landscaped places!!<br/>
<br/>
If it goes missing, I'll surely replace.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me know,<br/>

lid did close.<br/>
