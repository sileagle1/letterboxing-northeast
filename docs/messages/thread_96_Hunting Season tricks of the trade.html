are some of my  ideas. Well a lot of preserves have boxes and no <br/>
hunting that doesn't mean no poaching so I wear orange pretty much <br/>
all fall and winter. I think it is goose and black powder season <br/>
now.   I got my orange sweatshirts and vest at Walmart but they sell <br/>
out eary in the season and don't seem to replace when its gone as it <br/>
is a short selling season for that. If you are in the vicinity <br/>
Danielson Surplus in Danielson , Ct had some in the fall a call may <br/>
let you know how the stock is before you drive out or Dicks sporting <br/>
goods Buckland Mall in Manchester and there happen to  be boxes in <br/>
both directions.  Then I have two bells on my back pack all through <br/>
the fall. I enjoy the jingle as I walk the trail and certainly any <br/>
hunter will know that only Santa's deer jingle all the way. Sounds <br/>
funny but I believe  it helps . The last thing that will help you <br/>
would be my son... no really he is so loud in the woods everything in <br/>
a mile radius has heard him coming including the hunters who would <br/>
know all the wildlife have been scared off a 100 acre area.  well <br/>
have fun and be safe as always. carol - Leader of the Pack</div>

currently open in your area. As a former CT DEP Employee (emergency <br/>
dispatcher), I will mention that RI has the right idea with hunting -<br/>
if you're going in the woods from October through February, wear your <br/>
orange!!!!!   <br/>
<br/>
One thing to mention:  Hats are better seen than vests when walking <br/>
through brushy cover.   If you can afford an orange vest and an <br/>
orange ball cap, that is ideal. I personally wear a vest and an <br/>
orange "fisherman" hat with a wide brim. Heidi wears an orange <br/>
ballcap. We have a vest for Maddie and she also has a small cowbell <br/>
that you see used for bird dogs usually! <br/>
