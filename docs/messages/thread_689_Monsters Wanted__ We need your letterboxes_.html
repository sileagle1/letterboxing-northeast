                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-88953447">We are looking for volunteers that want to make us a letterbox with a carving of a TV or Movie monster or science fiction character. We will plant the box for you. The box can be given to us or mailed to us. The letterboxes will be put out all over the town of Mansfield CT Tolland County and will be left out only from October 1st to October 31st. As of November 1st they will all be picked up and taken in. You will be given full recognition that this is your box and carving. It will be your box and you count it as a plant for yourself. We are just planting it for you as part of the Mansfield Monster Mash. We are also having a Mansfield Monster Mash gathering Saturday October 2nd 2004 from 12 to 4 at the Lions Club Soccer fields pavilion off route 89 in Mansfield CT. More details to come. We would like the boxes by September 1st so we can have time to get out and plant them and write up the clues. To help us by making a box, contact me and tell me what you will be carving so we know<br/>
 what and how many boxes are being done. Send us all your monsters. Weï¿½ll put them all in Mansfield CT. We need your help to make this a success. The Mansfield Monster Mash is being organized by Chuck &amp; Molly, Chickabirdie, The NeeDeeps, and Teach &amp; Preach. Contact any of us if you would like to make a letterbox.<br/>
