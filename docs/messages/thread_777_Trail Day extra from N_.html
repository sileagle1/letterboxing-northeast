stamp that I will be turning into a letterbox to place during the <br/>
gathering. I intend to place it alone(possibly) and will not post the <br/>
clues until AFTER the gathering on Monday evening. This means you <br/>
will have to return to Tarrywile Park to collect the box. HOWEVER, if <br/>
you can translate the name of the box, and tell me it's name,(in <br/>
secret of course) you can collect the image and stamp into the <br/>
logbook. Sort of like a P.T.  I will not reveal the name of the box <br/>
until late tonight, so be sure to check your computers before you <br/>
leave in the A.M.!! Hope to see you all there!    ---Northstar</div>
