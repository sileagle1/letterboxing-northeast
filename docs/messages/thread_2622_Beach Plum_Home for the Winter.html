Winter. First Encounter Beach could'nt even be driven into due to a massive puddle/lake!<br/>
I'll be placing it back in the Spring with maybe some revised clues. It seems that the spot I <br/>
picked is a favorite teenage drinking spot. It's such a great spot though...<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing is, it had been hidden under a pile of logs. The kids used the wood to <br/>
build a campfire and obviously found my box. But one young man named Jon adopted the <br/>
box as his person diary and made such entries as " although I'm an infidel I will keep this <br/>
Beach Plum safe" then he would make entries about the weather etc. I kind of hated taking <br/>
his blog away. But I may have to put Beach Plum in a different spot because other kids may <br/>
not be as protective. Thanks Jon for keeping our Mother's letterbox safe! <br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion</div>
