We found this yesterday. It is definately there. Just make sure you expand your search a bit. I've been in contact with the placer after we found it and it appears it may have been moved a little from its original location. Also, watch out for poison ivy. Just don't touch any plants.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-350626822">Many thanks to those who have been in touch with me regarding this <br/>
box.  It appears that it didn't actually "go missing" as I had <br/>
believed.  And, as has been reported here, it does not appear to be in <br/>
the spot where it was orginally placed, so you will indeed need to <br/>
expand your search.  I have a friend who has been watching over this <br/>
box for me for two years and even he couldn't find it, so it is <br/>
definitely out of place.  If he doesn't get to it sooner, I will be in <br/>
Massachusetts the end of May and I will get it back in its original <br/>
location since I don't want to be responsible for anyone getting <br/>
poison ivy!!  I will also do my best to get a new log book down there <br/>
as soon as possible.  I can't tell you how happy I am to know it is <br/>
there, as it is one of my favorite stamps!<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting all!<br/>
