i am TOTALLY new to this. i read about it in Family Fun magazine, and <br/>
thought it would be a blast for me and my three sons, 7, 6 and 3. we <br/>
live in suffolk county, long island, new york. i am a single mother, so <br/>
the budget is TIGHT! we cannot travel all over the place to do this, <br/>
but wanted to give it a try. are there locations in our vicinity that <br/>
have "boxes"? (is that what you guys call them ?? LOL) please advise on <br/>
any locations or ideas that you may think would get us started. thanks</div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1741894543">Welcome to the hobby. My family (me, my wife, and 3 year old son) have <br/>
benn letterboxing for nearly 3 years now, and we love it. Though we <br/>
live in MA, most of my extended family live in Suffolk County. When we <br/>
vivist them we try to get a few letterboxes. There are quite a few <br/>
letterboxes in Suffolk County. There are several in and around Ridge. <br/>
Do a search on AtlasQuest or letterboxing.org. If you get out to <br/>
Hampton Bays, we just planted one out in Sears Bellow County Park in <br/>
August. We also found several more in and around Southampton. Good <br/>
luck and have fun.<br/>
