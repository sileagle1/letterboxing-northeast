<br/>
I remain subscribed to the big list (LbNA) but I don my asbestos armour <br/>
and carry extra flame-retardant when I post over there.  For some <br/>
reason I am actually amused by some of the flames/flamers ;).  One <br/>
reason I read the list frequently is just to see who's knickers are in <br/>
a twist!  Silly me. :p  And once in a while I actually get some useful <br/>
information or (heavens!) insight.<br/>

the flames can actually be quite funny. also, if you do your research you<br/>
will find that many flaming each other are actually the same person.  the<br/>
exception to this is when the flaming starts on a newbie or a principle,<br/>
then my o my, they can get their undies in a bunch. it helps if you realize<br/>
that many there are tired of the same old questions and the same old debate.<br/>
most, not all, of the members of the main list are dedicated boxers with a<br/>
lot of good advice if one cares to listen and learn. the waves of publicity<br/>
are scaring some and causing a lot to go underground. i can't say that i<br/>
blame them. the publicity scares me as well. i just happen to be of a<br/>
different belief. teach the newbies, those that are serious will stick<br/>
around and those that aren't will fade away. so, yes, i think the main list<br/>
is worth it. just don't take everything you read seriously, think before you<br/>
respond so that you don't fan the flames, learn what it there under it all,<br/>
and enjoy the banter inbetween. <br/>

<br/>
Thank you to all who responded to my questions about unsubbing from<br/>
the LbNA main list. I have decided to unsubscribe and just stick with<br/>
LbNE (we are in CT), the Newboxers list and Atlasquest. I just think<br/>
there is such a difference between being "honest" in replies and being<br/>
downright nasty. Someone over there replied to me that being on the<br/>
list and being anonymous allows people to be honest in their<br/>
responses. Though that may be true, it also allows people to be rude<br/>
and disrespectful and mean - not my cup of tea.<br/>
<br/>
I have enjoyed the talk on this list and look forward to getting to<br/>
know everyone better here.<br/>
<br/>
God bless ~<br/>
