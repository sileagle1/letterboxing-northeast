"The DEP, in conjunction with several other State agencies, is launching an initiative called "No Child Left Inside," to encourage children and their families to explore Connecticut's state parks. <br/>
A key part of the program is a contest called The Great Parks Pursuit: The Connecticut State Parks Family Adventure.  Families compete to hunt for clues in various state parks.  Prizes include mountain bikes and camping equipment. <br/>
<br/>
For more information about the program, or to register for the contest, just visit their official website at <a href="http://nochildleftinside.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://nochildleftinside.org/</a> "<br/>
