the event organizers for the wonderful prize! I never win anything. <br/>
Am I remembering correctly that it was made by one of the Maplines? <br/>
(sorry if I'm wrong!) Wonderful work! I look forward to using it on <br/>
some of the longer treks in Arcadia Park, RI. :)<br/>

I left the REALLY big honking stick for Brian so watch out if you <br/>
meet him on the trails! Tell him you really LOVED finding Dexter and <br/>
maybe he won't brain you with it. 8-)<br/>
