like we're beyond that here. Unfortunately, at this point, the oils  <br/>

at that point is reduce the itch as much as possible with cold  <br/>
compresses or oatmeal baths or calamine or creams or, frankly,  <br/>
Whatever The Heck Works On That Awful Itch....... Your doc may have  <br/>
some suggestions - antihistamines maybe or oral steroids if it's  <br/>
really bad. And wash the clothes you were wearing really well!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1458801787">This is kind of late in the process, but I'll tell you what I have found to help.  Immediately after known exposure, Technu seems to do a great job of preventing an outbreak.  They have a product line and sometimes they bundle in a bottle of Caligel (clear gel, not that thick pink junk) anti-itch, which seems to help an itch and dry blisters.<br/>
<br/>
I have gotten horrific cases of PI. If I get an outbreak, it usually becomes systemic.  Benadryl (oral) or similar antihistamine helps to help me sleep, but I drag butt. I find calamine lotion, oatmeal, and Cortaid to be totally ineffective for me.  Things that have helped in the past:<br/>
<br/>
Pre-emptive shot that works like most allergy shots.  I think it's a sort of hair-of-the-dog before the exposure that minimizes reaction.  Now that you know you are sensitive, you may want to get a shot around April.  I think the timing is important. I haven't done this in a while because I haven't had any serious outbreak in a while.<br/>
<br/>
Technu to clean any urushiol off anywhere that may have come in contact but hasn't erupted yet. I fell completely into a hedge of PI a couple of weeks before my wedding. When I got myself out of that bush (and ivy can grow enormous, especially by the water; it can climb, but doesn't need to in order to grow huge), I ran to the drug store and got Technu, and showered at a friend's house. The branches and leaves had poked in, under, around, and through my clothing. I ended up with only two small batches of rash that I managed to clear up fast on my forearms, and I think that the reason why the Technu couldn't stop the rash on my forearms was because the skin had been broken, letting the plant resin under the skin. Years ago, I would have suffered for weeks from such an exposure, and my skin would scar from it. This time, Technu saved the day. No PI or blotches on The Big Day.<br/>
<br/>
When I have had that rash-on-rash, hideous bubbling, blistering, weeping reaction that crops out all over in places that it should not, the only OTC remedy that dried up the blisters for me was Ivy Dry. I think they have a whole product line now, but all they had then was a brown bottle of a tanic acid solution. It dries up the blisters, whereas calamine would dry up and flake in some places, but combined with that lymphatic (I think) fluid and make a sticky, oozy, and runny mess that would soak into bandages and clothing. <br/>
<br/>
The pharmacist and doctor should be able to recommend things that patients have said worked for them. You can probably get lots of info on line, but you may have to do all your own trials to find out what works for you. I think a cortisone shot saves the day for many people with bad reactions, minimizing the blistering and shortening recovery time.  Good luck!  And think about asking for the Boo-boo box. I think there's a PLB for just PI, too.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and make sure you wash everthing that came in contact with the plants really, really well, or throw them away.<br/>
<br/>

  Yeah, that stuff is nasty!<br/>
  But at least you got it doing something good!<br/>
  When I end up with a batch Ivarest is good, but as someone else said you might be beyond the PI remedy stage and on to scratching infection - this is why they tell you not scratch the rash (even if it feels good for the moment).<br/>
  I have also used a salt poultice or gone down to the beach, but if I remember correctly you're from up North and not necessarily near a salt water beach. <br/>
  Good luck and I'll keep you in my thoughts.<br/>

clothes if it was hit bad with PI. TECHNU is some over the counter  <br/>
stuff that I love to use when we get it, or think we have gotten it.  <br/>
TECHNU can also be used to wash out clothes. Put some in the wash  <br/>

&gt; If you can wash off the oils immediately, that's great, but it looks<br/>

My worst experience wasn't exactly mine. A woman I knew was out  <br/>
hiking with friends and they pointedout some poison ivy. I don't know  <br/>
if it had purple leaves or why she didn't think it was PI, but she  <br/>
told them it wasn't PI. Well, a discussion ensued and she, being one  <br/>
of those people who is always right (we all know at least one, lol)  <br/>
decided to demonstrate that she was right by grabbing a handful of  <br/>
leaves and rubbing them alllllllll over her face. I can't describe  <br/>
how terribly itchy and painful that looked once her entire face  <br/>
erupted in sores. Noone is always right and PI is an awful way to get  <br/>

&gt; it will decrease. after i get out of the shower, i would spray on  <br/>
&gt; some benadryl spray on it then and go most of the day without  <br/>
&gt; itching it at all. of course, with the hot muggy weather, the spray  <br/>
&gt; may not work and the hot water probably wouldn't feel that great on  <br/>
&gt; none infected areas. my suggestion is if you try this route, do it  <br/>
&gt; at night when it is cooler and the hot water would feel better.  <br/>
&gt; spray yourself and go to bed. repeat in the morning before it gets  <br/>
&gt; hot again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   this worked for me, but i have heard that the hot water thing is  <br/>
&gt; a bad idea.<br/>
