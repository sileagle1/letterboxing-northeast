They're predicting this to be quite bad up here "Like a wall" was what the<br/>
news said this a.m., with over 12" predicted, to start around noon.  Maybe<br/>
he could stay with a friend on Fri and you could drive up (with less<br/>
headache) on Sat?<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck!! <br/>

few years ago the weather was exactly like this.  My  husband was in <br/>
California, and I had to get her back to school.  What a  nightmare.  I guess, looking <br/>
at your situation, mine was better, I am a  lot closer than Maryland, only two <br/>
hours away for me.   Good luck  and Happy Holidays!<br/>

like it's going ot be a mess, with snow in some areas coming down  <br/>
