<br/>
I knew if I waited long enough, someone would articulate at least part of how I feel.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't agree with you more.<br/>
<br/>
If I see a repeat, and I recognize it as such, I have a choice: reread and revisit the topic, or dismiss and delete.  Not a tough one for me: not keystroke, thought, or time intensive. I figure people cross-post either because they don't want to overlook anyone in their intended audience (to cover all the bases), or they are looking for more ideas or responses than one board might give them.  Whatever.  It hardly hurts me. And you are spot-on about the positive side of seeing the post repeated: it can make one go, "Oh, yeah!  I forgot all about that!"   <br/>
<br/>
The only times that cross-posting is irritating to me is when the post is totally irrelevant to the group, either in terms of the topic or the people involved on that list.  I don't see much of that on any of the many lists I have to weed through.  <br/>
<br/>
Slightly irksome is the same thread under new topic headings, which is what happens when replying to digest posts.  Now, do I change this heading to "Crossposting revisited" or "more on crosposting"?  Nah. Then we get the same topic split into different threads and you might never know that I posted a "Me, too!" post in reply to yours. Just a capital letter, hyphen, or misspelling could cause some mail program to sort the reply into yet another thread on cross posting.  Hey, that would be a cool passive-aggressive way to tick off the people who want things just so, now wouldn't it?  &lt;evil grin&gt;  And I could add all the LB subgroups into the To: field.  mwahahahaha.<br/>

&lt;eagerly awaiting a new thread on why we should make a new rule or just outright ban any dry, sarcastic, me too, or otherwise bothersome-to-some-people post(er)s.&gt;<br/>
