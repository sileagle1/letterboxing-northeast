We noticed that the yellow and red trails have been reblazed and a new white trail has been added. Lots of exploring to be done. Today we had to move box #3 of the Circle of Lives series because of trees down (it was buried under three large trees and thank you Gizz for crawling under them to retrieve the box) be sure to print out new ones.</div>
