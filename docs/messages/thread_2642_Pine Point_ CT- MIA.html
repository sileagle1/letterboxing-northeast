ago, but between then &amp; now the box has vanished.  If anyone was there<br/>
after Nov. 28 &amp; saw the box could you let me know.  If anyone found<br/>
the box, but took it home for some TLC would you please let me know<br/>
(it's possible I included an old email address in the logbook).  <br/>
There's a hole in the Earth/stone where the box used to be, so it's<br/>
definitely gone; I'd like to salvage any of it that I can.  <br/>

Thanks a bunch!<br/>

<br/>
I found that box on 11/26/05 along with Moonstone Baby.  It was right <br/>
where it was supposed to be, and we are *extremely* careful rehiders <br/>
(we've both got 5 years letterboxing experience *each).<br/>
<br/>
Were we the last finders, or did someone find it after us?<br/>

at all concerned with how you left it- I was there after you (I drive<br/>
by every day after all) &amp; I know it couldn't be seen.  Someone had to<br/>
FIND it &amp; remove it.  So, either someone who already knew it was there<br/>
took it, or someone hanging around the grounds, somehow stumbled upon<br/>
it (could've been rock thieves- I know they come around sometimes).  <br/>
<br/>
No one at the school seems to have it, but they are all on the<br/>
lookout- just in case.  I think I'm going to have to recarve...sigh. <br/>
Mostly, I just mourn the loss of the logbook.  C'est la vie.  <br/>
