I'm not kidding. I went boxing today and boy does the old nose run in cold<br/>
weather, LOL.  I also carry an old ski pole, which helps me keep my balance<br/>
and get up and down trails safely.<br/>
<br/>
Found the In My Heart and Good Luck boxes in Ashfield, MA today.  Beautiful<br/>
spots, although the trails are snow/icy right now.  I didn't mind but would<br/>
not have taken kids--too slippery for little ones.  These are new boxes<br/>
that haven't had many visitors, so go find them!<br/>
<br/>
Tried but failed to find Chip N Dale at Lake Fitzgerald Reservation in<br/>
Northampton, MA.  I think the long flat rock I needed to see must have been<br/>
buried under snow.  It was a great hike, very scenic, so I'll go back<br/>
another time.<br/>
<br/>
I also bring energy bars, fruit, water, extra Ziplocks, and paper towels<br/>
whenever I set out, even if I think it's a quick hike (sometimes they turn<br/>
into long treks).<br/>
<br/>

suggestions for 5 or 6 boxes in one place that are doable right now in the<br/>
snow?  I'm willing to drive down to Connecticut.)</div>

</span></blockquote>Phyto, Isosceles and crew did some boxing today. Started out <br/>
with Brodie Park. Replaced all the bags in that box. They were <br/>
slimey. Moved on to Hermit's Grave. This isn't listed on the new <br/>
site anymore, but I'm happy to report that we placed some <br/>
greens in honor of this site for the box is very much alive! Did <br/>
some box/bag repair at that site too.<br/>
<br/>
Finished the Nature of the Forest Series at the DEP in <br/>
Barkhamsted in the dark. This is alive and well but it was a <br/>
stretch for us finishing up at 5:15pm!!! Thank goodness for the <br/>
sliver of moonlight. It's dark at 4pm in Maine usually.<br/>
<br/>
So, my suggestion (for winter boxing) would be to bring paper <br/>
towels to wipe out the inside of the box and EXTRA PLASTIC <br/>
ZIPLOC FREEZER BAGS.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the great series Music Woman, Engraver, Chuck and <br/>
Butterfly. <br/>

<br/>
Just thought I would tell you about some of our boxes (search under <br/>
placer...amy &amp; jay).  We have placed 9 boxes in Wrentham, Plainville, <br/>
Norfolk, and Franklin.  All boxes are off of 495, within short drives <br/>
of each other, and none are super long treks.  We checked a few of <br/>
our boxes this weekend and placed another (Happy Turtle LB) yesterday <br/>
and the trails are pretty clear for the most part (some ice in areas, <br/>
but not much).  It sounds like you are from Western or Central Mass, <br/>
so Southeastern Mass might be a shorter drive to get to F100 before <br/>
New Years!  Good luck in finding your letterboxes and I hope you find <br/>
ours~if not soon, then maybe later~!<br/>
