Pigtographer and I went out on the calm before the storm down to East<br/>
Providence, RI to find the Looff Carousel box.  Great stamp, and we<br/>
got some sea glass too.  Only downside was our head and eyes were<br/>
hurting from the biting cold!<br/>
<br/>
We must be crazy going out today!<br/>

Tomorrow is the most important thing in life. Comes into us at midnight very clean. It's perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands. It hopes we've learned something from yesterday. <br/>

I remember seeing your comment on not finding box 1... In the clues <br/>
Redbird is under a small crabapple tree, When I was there yesterday, <br/>
the crabapple tree had been cut down by a beaver (cant blame the <br/>
beaver!) ... I actually couldnt identify crabapple without leaves, <br/>
but saw a distinctive rock setting there (today covered with much <br/>
snow, but with PowWow Dancers tracks serpentining to it - I brought <br/>
him back there today)... the paces are correct in the clues, the box <br/>
is there but I think there is water damage to the log book... all the <br/>
pages are kinda... ice encrusted... and frozen together).<br/>
