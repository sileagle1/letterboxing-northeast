 <br/>
As a side note, this box will be in place for the first three weeks of the month, as stated in the clues. It will be pulled late in the day on the 21st or early in the morning of the 22nd EACH MONTH. When I remember, I try to give a warning when it is almost time. I sometimes get busy, as "life gets in the way" of letterboxing on occasion. <br/>
 <br/>
A wonderful Eagle Scout project was completed and the trail there now is blazed in red and is a LOOP TRAIL!!! 8-) It is still a little rough in some spots, but is in much better shape than before. Please follow the blazed trail now and disregard the earlier clues.<br/>
 <br/>
To all that have mentioned it, the trail was mowed and there was no issue with Nettles today when the box was planted. I wore shorts and did not have a single problem. Of course, Baby D still does not like the coarse ground across the field 8-(<br/>
 <br/>
I hope you all use the entire blazed loop trail. You never know, there just may be a little something along the way if you have read my clues to one of my mystery boxes...<br/>
 <br/>
If you go tomorrow (7/3/10), there is going to be a fun time at Szegda Farm. From 10-2 there will be demonstrations, samples of locally made ice cream and cheese, trail hikes, compost discussions as  well as talking about the community garden.<br/>
Have fun!!<br/>
