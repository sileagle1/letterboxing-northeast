and Cats of the Castle are missing.  They also told me that several <br/>
other boxes there were missing.  The grinch was one of them and <br/>
Inspiration was the other I believe.  Sunshine is going tomorrow to <br/>
confirm that my boxes are truly missing.<br/>
I'm hoping that Sunshine finds them alive and well, but I'm beginning <br/>
to have my doubts.<br/>

person or persons I just wanted to say that having been robbed three <br/>
times within the last year and a half, this is just a glitch in the <br/>
road for us.  I'm saddened that one of the boxes that was my favorite, <br/>
and one that I worked very hard on, was taken, but in the scheme of <br/>
things it's just a game/hobby after all.  The folks who removed our <br/>
boxes are just as cowardly as the people who robbed us.  It'a a shame <br/>
that they couldn't put their talents to some pursuit of greater good.  <br/>
People are suffering and dying all over the world and these people <br/>
couldn't find anything better to do than spend their energies on <br/>
hunting down tupperware in the woods to destroy.  If it wasn't so <br/>
pathetic it would be laughable. <br/>
If they are reading this post, they have my permission to fill my <br/>
tupperware with writing materials or toiletries and send them to a <br/>
charity of their choice. <br/>
If they don't have a favorite charity, which I tend to think may be <br/>
closer to the truth, they may use the containers for leftovers.</div>
