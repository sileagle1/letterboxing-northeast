It is part of our Treasures of Yarmouth Scavenger Hunt, and there will be over a dozen new hand-carved stamps along our map route, plus the chance to gather with other letterboxers at the reception in the evening. The event is only $12,(children under 12 are free) and includes the entire day's adventure plus a reception with live music, food and drinks. Truly valubale prizes for successful "hunters"! The day allows plenty of time to go do additional letterboxing - and there are a LOT of boxes in Yarmouth. We have already posted on Atlas Quest - but would love to learn how to get the word out throughout New England with your help! Thank you! Any questions call 508-394-7100</div>
