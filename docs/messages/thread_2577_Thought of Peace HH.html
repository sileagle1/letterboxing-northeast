Thank you Rev. Noone et al. for the opportunity to meet and the warm <br/>
welcome that was given to a neophyte in Gathering Customs. I was able <br/>
to meet many new people and put faces to the names but I also realize <br/>
that there were many colleagues that I missed <br/>
<br/>
I hope I will have the opportunity to `cross paths' with them in the <br/>

We had a great time, as usual, at the Gathering. I t was wonderful to see everyone and meet some new people as well.<br/>
Any one going aster the clues in the "Scroll"? We understand it's very difficult. Would love to tag along. Dave and I got a late start and saw some of the landmarks, but could not find tha first 3 boxes.<br/>

Ahhh that was a fun day .  Starting off with rain and the crowd proved <br/>
that rain does not stop letterboxers. The rain stopped, some sun  came <br/>
out and it was wonderful   Thanks to Bluebird, Fish or Man and those <br/>
that also planted.  We were all so quiet working on the clues,  and then <br/>
went off for the hunt.<br/>
 As usual, the food was fun too.<br/>
Thanks to all<br/>

great gather!  I got there so late however, that I didn't get much <br/>
boxing done, but it was nice to meet some new boxers as well as seeing <br/>
some old friends (not old as in age though!)!<br/>
<br/>
The carvings that I did see were excellent!  We are so blessed to have <br/>
such great carvers!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for a great gather!  Maybe next time, I won't have <br/>
rehearsal and can get there on time ;-)<br/>
