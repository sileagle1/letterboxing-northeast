Hello, all! Sorry we hit the trail so soon after arrival, but we always have to capitalize on Jonah's momentum!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we were the last to leave the pavilion after the main event broke up, and there was one reusable insulated shopping bag left all alone with no ID and some stuff inside. Not wanting to leave it unattended, we took it home. If it is yours, please contact us off-list or via AQ mail, tell us what was in it, and then we'll discuss how to reunite you.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to all, especially Charlotte and Juliana (apologies for spelling!) for playing soccer later in the afternoon!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see many of you at Where the Wild Things Are in two weeks! We'll be there to share some Bear Noise to all who missed it.<br/>
