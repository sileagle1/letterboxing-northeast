Judith for that letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
The logbook and stamp are fine, but water had gotten to the stamp <br/>
pad and made a mess. Unwrapped the stamp from a very blue, very wet <br/>
paper towel. We re-bagged items and removed the pad and its bag and <br/>
left happy but with blue hands!<br/>
<br/>
So, if you visit this box, be sure to bring a stamp pad. Oh, I would <br/>
recommend long pants and shoes, not sandals, if you are in growing <br/>
season as the path is quite overgrown. (We managed without but are <br/>
now praying there was no poison ivy...)<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
