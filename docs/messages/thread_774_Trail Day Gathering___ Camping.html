<br/>
Camping at the Trail Day Gathering has been taken care of.  If you <br/>
have emailed me with the intent to camp at Tarrywile and participate <br/>
in the "Things That Go Bump In The Night" evening letterboxes, you <br/>
are all set.  As you arrive tommorrow please be sure to register <br/>
with the park for your camp permit.  They will meet with all of us <br/>
at 3:00 PM to explain the park rules and regulations.  We will have <br/>
to move some cars to Immaculate HS or the Mall so that parking is <br/>
available for the wedding reception that evening.  I thought we <br/>
would all head over to Rosie Tomorrow's for some dinner and come <br/>
back for some fun evening letterboxing.  I am very sorry for all the <br/>
confusion in the past few days.  I hope to see you all on Saturday!<br/>
<br/>

call the park @ 203.794.1043 to sign up as a volunteer, due to the <br/>
fact that the park is taking a head count of volunteers so they can <br/>
provide a lunch for the volunteer workers... <br/>
