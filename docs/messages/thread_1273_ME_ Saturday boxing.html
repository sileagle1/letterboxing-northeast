                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-230940792">I found a few boxes on Saturday. Not as many as I would have liked <br/>
to, as I think some of them may have been missing. All the boxes <br/>
listed below were in great shape. All were hidden well and not wet at <br/>
all!<br/>
<br/>
I found:<br/>
<br/>
Royal River<br/>
Griffondale<br/>
Maine Hiking<br/>
Mackworth Island #3<br/>
River of Our Love<br/>
<br/>
I tried looking for the Bradbury Mountain LB, but couldn't find it. <br/>
Has anyone found this box recently, or is it missing? I also tried to <br/>
find the Mackworth Island series, but only found the last one. I have <br/>
since discovered that the 2nd one is missing, but is the first one <br/>
missing as well??<br/>

anything. Are the clue to the series you mention on lbna? Any one <br/>

<br/>
Remembering Garry is missing.<br/>
Fairy Homes was moved a long time ago.<br/>
I haven't checked on them in a while, but it wouldn't surprise me if <br/>
they're gone -or- if they're still there. The only one confirmed <br/>
missing is #2 which is actually Isosceles' box.<br/>
<br/>
It is a busy busy spot in the summer as well as a favorite dog-<br/>
walking spot of locals.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>
I also listed these on the Atlas Quest clue directory.<br/>
