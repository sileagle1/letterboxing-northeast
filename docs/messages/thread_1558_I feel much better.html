I've got just one thing to say.  Everyone ready...deep breath.  I'M <br/>

this whole "PFX" thing.  No one would care.  Am I right?  I love the <br/>
fact that I have upwards of 3500 finds.  Really, does anyone really NEED <br/>
to hike from Georgia to Maine.  You couldn't pay me.  Well you could, <br/>

letterboxers seem to approach counting in quite the same way.  The <br/>
Thunderhooves approach is simple --  LIE!  Rainy day, slept late, <br/>
can't find your shoes?  No problem, just say you went out anyway.  <br/>
You can letterbox 24 hours a day, 365.25 days a year, in any <br/>
weather, from the privacy of your own home.  The monetary savings in <br/>
logs, ink, stamps, etc. are astounding.  If you want to start lying <br/>
about geocaching, the savings are even greater.<br/>

&gt; Here at Thunderhooves World Headquarters, we've been following this <br/>
&gt; thread with great interest, and I've noticed that no two <br/>
&gt; letterboxers seem to approach counting in quite the same way.  The <br/>
&gt; Thunderhooves approach is simple --  LIE!  Rainy day, slept late, <br/>
&gt; can't find your shoes?  No problem, just say you went out anyway.  <br/>
&gt; You can letterbox 24 hours a day, 365.25 days a year, in any <br/>
&gt; weather, from the privacy of your own home.  The monetary savings in <br/>
&gt; logs, ink, stamps, etc. are astounding.  If you want to start lying <br/>
&gt; about geocaching, the savings are even greater.<br/>

Look, I generally just lurk on this board, but I feel obliged to <br/>
point out that this post is, unless I am seriously misreading it, a <br/>
joke. And a pretty funny one.<br/>
<br/>
Read it again. Then take a deep breath. Consider, also, that the <br/>
poster called himself "Dinker Von Dinkerstein." <br/>
<br/>
Let's not get too bent up about things like this. FUN hobby, remember?<br/>
