                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-642010774">Hi Carrie,<br/>
<br/>
I live just outside of Worcester, and just started LBing 3 months ago with<br/>
my husband &amp; two children (ages "just turned 4" &amp;" 5-1/2"). I'd love to swap<br/>
tips off-list for "good" &amp; "bad" hunts for kids in this age group. I thought<br/>
I'd first respond on the list in case there are others nearby who might also<br/>
be interested in this kind of info sharing for our area.<br/>
<br/>
I will say that among our first trips out were two "the lazy letterboxer"<br/>
series in Waushacum Ponds Rail Trail in Sterling, MA (Dave's Faves and Build<br/>
your own Burger), and I recommend both.<br/>
<br/>
First, (and these are in no particular order) it is a Rail Trail, which<br/>
allows for taking along a wagon or stroller, in case your daughter gets<br/>
tired. The first time I had to hike any distance carrying my 35 lb son, I<br/>
started to attend to this option, unless I knew it was a short hike. I also<br/>
tend to take water &amp; snacks &amp; a few other kid things (e.g., a change of<br/>
clothes has been needed) in addition to the usual LB stuff &amp; camera, so a<br/>
wagon is handy.<br/>
<br/>
Second, there is a lot of "bang for your buck" since these two series are<br/>
both multiple boxes (6 boxes and 7 boxes). This is nice b/c if you cannot<br/>
find a box or two, no big deal. Also, my kids like to take turns with the<br/>
"find," so I lean toward plants with at least 2 boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Third, the clues are easy for the kids to follow (which is the coolest kind<br/>
of LB for them) with perhaps a bit of subtle guidance from the helpless<br/>
adults who can "never" find those Tupperware boxes anywhere!<br/>
<br/>
Fourth, they are FUN, hand-carved stamps for the kids to find...engaging for<br/>
them in a way that some of the more abstract adult-oriented stamps are not.<br/>
<br/>
Fifth, it is a beautiful reservoir with a fun little bridge that just calls<br/>
to be played, as if an instrument, via a variety of stomping techniques.<br/>
<br/>
Sixth, there is no hunting allowed.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, they were definitely fun times! We did them in two separate<br/>
trips.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to these family outings, I try to go at least once a week by<br/>
myself to explore some new areas. This is part "therapy," part adventure,<br/>
sometimes scouting (for good places to take the kids later), and all<br/>
wonderful. In these journeys I have found a few local LBs that I really<br/>
enjoyed, but I would definitely NOT recommend when you are out with the<br/>
young-uns.<br/>
<br/>
We sometimes call them "treasure hunts" in addition to "letterboxing," b/c<br/>
what is cooler for a kid than a treasure hunt? However, I also think it is<br/>
really fun to try to incorporate some learning opportunities into the hikes.<br/>
Not too much, or they can't take it all in &amp; will tune me out. I am repetive<br/>
as much as possible. For example, teaching them the words "trail blaze" and<br/>
having them search for them. Then adding that these help us stay on the<br/>
trail and know where to go next. And using the terminology &amp; activity on<br/>
each hike that has trail blazes. Also about what a reservoir is, or the<br/>
difference between oak leaves and maple leaves, or what is "bushwhacking"<br/>
and why do we not want to do this, or anything else we come across that I<br/>
have a clue about. And I'll ask them about what we've talked about on other<br/>
journeys, e.g., "Who can find the kiosk? What is a kiosk for?" I'm starting<br/>
with some very basic instruction on using a compass. I do these kinds of<br/>
things b/c I don't want it to be just about finding the "treasure." I want<br/>
them to engage in the place, to enjoy the walks for what else they hold<br/>
(kids LOVE to learn new things), and, most especially, to try to nurture a<br/>
sense of stewardship toward the land.<br/>
<br/>
One of my first "mistakes" was to try to "squeeze" an LB trip into a certain<br/>
time-frame with my 5-year-old. I thought one hour was plenty of time, but I<br/>
didn't count on the 20 minutes she took to enjoy playing with milkweed. I<br/>
actually had to move her along to stand a chance of finding the box,<br/>
thinking she'd be upset if we didn't find it. In the end, the box was<br/>
missing. She was unphased--she just wanted to get back to the field of<br/>
milkweed to play with it some more! Ding-ding-ding went the bells in my<br/>
head...lesson learned from daughter.<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to hear about the LBs you've done &amp; your thoughts about them.<br/>
Please feel free to contact me off-list to exchange info re: Worcester<br/>
County kid-letterboxing.<br/>

  Thank you so much for all of your helpful advice for the Sterling area.  My friend and I are looking into branching out into a few different areas of Mass and RI, so we will definitely try the ones in Sterling that you had mentioned.  Maybe we will run into you sometime!  Has anyone been to a LB event in the area???<br/>

<br/>
My mom &amp; I started letterboxing in August, we are having a blast.  We are from the Springfield Mass area.  So far, one of our favorite carvers around here is curiouscrow.  Her stuff is just incredible.  She has alot in the Northampton/Holyoke area, and along rt 63.  <br/>
<br/>
We've also been to some events, and they are so much fun, and we get a ton of great stamps.  My family is hosting an event in Holyoke on June 26th.  It's called Boxing Lake Bray.  The theme is children's fictional characters and we'll have tons of stamps as table-tops and in the woods.   Feel free to sign up on Atlasquest.com<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I've rambled enough.  Feel free to ask anything further.  I'll be happy to help!<br/>

&gt;   Thank you so much for all of your helpful advice for the Sterling area.  My friend and I are looking into branching out into a few different areas of Mass and RI, so we will definitely try the ones in Sterling that you had mentioned.  Maybe we will run into you sometime!  Has anyone been to a LB event in the area???<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi Carrie,<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I live just outside of Worcester, and just started LBing 3 months ago with<br/>
&gt; &gt; my husband &amp; two children (ages "just turned 4" &amp;" 5-1/2"). I'd love to swap<br/>
&gt; &gt; tips off-list for "good" &amp; "bad" hunts for kids in this age group. I thought<br/>
&gt; &gt; I'd first respond on the list in case there are others nearby who might also<br/>
&gt; &gt; be interested in this kind of info sharing for our area.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I will say that among our first trips out were two "the lazy letterboxer"<br/>
&gt; &gt; series in Waushacum Ponds Rail Trail in Sterling, MA (Dave's Faves and Build<br/>
&gt; &gt; your own Burger), and I recommend both.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; First, (and these are in no particular order) it is a Rail Trail, which<br/>
&gt; &gt; allows for taking along a wagon or stroller, in case your daughter gets<br/>
&gt; &gt; tired. The first time I had to hike any distance carrying my 35 lb son, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; started to attend to this option, unless I knew it was a short hike. I also<br/>
&gt; &gt; tend to take water &amp; snacks &amp; a few other kid things (e.g., a change of<br/>
&gt; &gt; clothes has been needed) in addition to the usual LB stuff &amp; camera, so a<br/>
&gt; &gt; wagon is handy.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Second, there is a lot of "bang for your buck" since these two series are<br/>
&gt; &gt; both multiple boxes (6 boxes and 7 boxes). This is nice b/c if you cannot<br/>
&gt; &gt; find a box or two, no big deal. Also, my kids like to take turns with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; "find," so I lean toward plants with at least 2 boxes.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Third, the clues are easy for the kids to follow (which is the coolest kind<br/>
&gt; &gt; of LB for them) with perhaps a bit of subtle guidance from the helpless<br/>
&gt; &gt; adults who can "never" find those Tupperware boxes anywhere!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Fourth, they are FUN, hand-carved stamps for the kids to find...engaging for<br/>
&gt; &gt; them in a way that some of the more abstract adult-oriented stamps are not.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Fifth, it is a beautiful reservoir with a fun little bridge that just calls<br/>
&gt; &gt; to be played, as if an instrument, via a variety of stomping techniques.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Sixth, there is no hunting allowed.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; All in all, they were definitely fun times! We did them in two separate<br/>
&gt; &gt; trips.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; In addition to these family outings, I try to go at least once a week by<br/>
&gt; &gt; myself to explore some new areas. This is part "therapy," part adventure,<br/>
&gt; &gt; sometimes scouting (for good places to take the kids later), and all<br/>
&gt; &gt; wonderful. In these journeys I have found a few local LBs that I really<br/>
&gt; &gt; enjoyed, but I would definitely NOT recommend when you are out with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; young-uns.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We sometimes call them "treasure hunts" in addition to "letterboxing," b/c<br/>
&gt; &gt; what is cooler for a kid than a treasure hunt? However, I also think it is<br/>
&gt; &gt; really fun to try to incorporate some learning opportunities into the hikes.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Not too much, or they can't take it all in &amp; will tune me out. I am repetive<br/>
&gt; &gt; as much as possible. For example, teaching them the words "trail blaze" and<br/>
&gt; &gt; having them search for them. Then adding that these help us stay on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; trail and know where to go next. And using the terminology &amp; activity on<br/>
&gt; &gt; each hike that has trail blazes. Also about what a reservoir is, or the<br/>
&gt; &gt; difference between oak leaves and maple leaves, or what is "bushwhacking"<br/>
&gt; &gt; and why do we not want to do this, or anything else we come across that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have a clue about. And I'll ask them about what we've talked about on other<br/>
&gt; &gt; journeys, e.g., "Who can find the kiosk? What is a kiosk for?" I'm starting<br/>
&gt; &gt; with some very basic instruction on using a compass. I do these kinds of<br/>
&gt; &gt; things b/c I don't want it to be just about finding the "treasure." I want<br/>
&gt; &gt; them to engage in the place, to enjoy the walks for what else they hold<br/>
&gt; &gt; (kids LOVE to learn new things), and, most especially, to try to nurture a<br/>
&gt; &gt; sense of stewardship toward the land.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; One of my first "mistakes" was to try to "squeeze" an LB trip into a certain<br/>
&gt; &gt; time-frame with my 5-year-old. I thought one hour was plenty of time, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn't count on the 20 minutes she took to enjoy playing with milkweed. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; actually had to move her along to stand a chance of finding the box,<br/>
&gt; &gt; thinking she'd be upset if we didn't find it. In the end, the box was<br/>
&gt; &gt; missing. She was unphased--she just wanted to get back to the field of<br/>
&gt; &gt; milkweed to play with it some more! Ding-ding-ding went the bells in my<br/>
&gt; &gt; head...lesson learned from daughter.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I'd love to hear about the LBs you've done &amp; your thoughts about them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Please feel free to contact me off-list to exchange info re: Worcester<br/>
&gt; &gt; County kid-letterboxing.<br/>
