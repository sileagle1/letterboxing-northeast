<br/>
Was there really any doubt you would mend and be back out haunting the trails? :D<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you and Gizz need to file hike plans and bring along chaperones or rescue personnel.  This 'boxing thing is hazardous; see: waiver of responsibility... :o  (So glad it didn't happen while searching for another one of my 'boxes.)<br/>
<br/>
Welcome back, Duc!<br/>
