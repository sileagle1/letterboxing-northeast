repair, it has been pulled from the website and thrown into the <br/>
basement. I would like to voice my intentions to pull the other two <br/>
boxes from their hiding places and make the necessary repairs to <br/>
them. Following this, I would be adopting the whole series and be the <br/>
one to mantain it. On the website the boxes were listed <br/>
as "unclaimed", so I will use this site to give the original creator <br/>
and owner of the series a chance to claim them before I begin my <br/>
repair efforts.    --NORTHSTAR</div>
