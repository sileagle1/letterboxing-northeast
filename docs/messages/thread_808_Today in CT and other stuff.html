(Magic Carpet Ride) It will be re-released very soon!<br/>
<br/>
Just a little side note hint, hint we also dropped off a different HH which<br/>
we picked up in Nebraska in May. Now you just have to figure out which of<br/>
the 34 Lebanon boxes it is in. Haha!<br/>
<br/>
Gentle Reminder: When rehiding boxes please remember to cover and double<br/>
check yourselves! This week alone I have found 3 boxes laying in the open.<br/>
Totally exposed!<br/>
<br/>
Also spray yourselves down, wear long socks and long pants. We counted 20<br/>
ticks today between the 4 of us. How gross!!</div>
