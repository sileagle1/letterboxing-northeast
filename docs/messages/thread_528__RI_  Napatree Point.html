lighthouse.  There was a reference to a nearby geocache in one of <br/>
the logbooks, but we didn't find it.<br/>
<br/>
It was somewhat wet and wild out there yesterday, but I would prefer <br/>
prickers and naked mystery plants (vines and others) to fields of <br/>
poison ivy in full foliage.  That place could use a machete. ;-)  <br/>
The beach was wide open, meaning no plover lines.  Those must go up <br/>
during a defined nesting season.  No bugs yet.  Lots of waterfoul, <br/>
including loons.  There were a few dogs running free with their <br/>
owners, but none ventured up to the dunes, and none were out of <br/>
control.  The signs say dogs are to be kept on leash at all times. <br/>
We saw no osprey.  <br/>
<br/>
For boxers who have not been out on this strip of beach: This is a <br/>
better time to go than mid-to-late summer for ease of access.  Some <br/>
people even prefer the winter. Besides a minmum amount of people and <br/>
dogs, and poison ivy, there was lots of parking available, and we <br/>
drove down the lane ("walkers welcome") to the lighthouse without <br/>
incident.  If we go back to the point in warmer weather, it will be <br/>
for the beach and water's edge.  Sunsets there are really nice, too, <br/>
and worth the trip.  I wouldn't recommend this area for night boxing <br/>
due mostly to unsafe footing, especially inland through the <br/>
shrubbery, etc., so plan to catch the sunset after boxing instead of <br/>
before.  ;-)  The lighthouse should be done in dry daylight, too, <br/>
and even then be aware that the dry loose rocks are tricky and not <br/>
for the weak ankled.  <br/>
