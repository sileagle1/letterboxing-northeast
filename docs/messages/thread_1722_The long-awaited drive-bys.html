know, there is an event scheduled for January 16 to do the drive-bys in <br/>
Hartford County.  Whether or not you're planning to attend, feel free to look at <br/>

Now...  IF you are planning to attend the Hartford County gather, please do <br/>
two things:  <br/>
1.  Please email me (<a href="mailto:davyschris@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">davyschris@...</a>) so I can keep an estimated head <br/>
count.  If you forget to do this and still want to attend, no big deal, but I'd <br/>
really like to have an idea, ya know?  :)  5?  15?  20?  We need to plan because <br/>
of cars, etc.<br/>
2.  I know this may be a pain, but if you could also include in your email <br/>
which of the drive-bys you already have, I'd appreciate it.  It will be <br/>
inevitable that a lot of us, especially if we live in this county, will be repeating <br/>
boxes that we've already found.  I personally have all but four or five of <br/>
them, but I'm going for the fun.  :)  However, I think we can safely exclude some <br/>
boxes that EVERYONE has.  That will save us some time.<br/>
