                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-624946800">well, i have made the first step in conquering mother nature. "white <br/>
sands" is back in place. the road leading to white sands is in bad <br/>
shape, so if you go to find this box, please park at the bottom of <br/>
white sands road and walk the rest of the way. it might add about 10 <br/>
minutes to your find time, but the mighty merrimack river will amaze <br/>
you when you get there. oh and to give those a heads up on the <br/>
condition of white sands it self, the trash is making its way back. <br/>
and the river had nothing to do with it. its time to take this matter <br/>
higher. thanks again to everyone that helped clean up white sands.<br/>
<br/>
i plan on replanting "up, up, and away" today as well.<br/>
