the states of Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and<br/>
Vermont. Personally, I would call that New England and expand the<br/>
"northeast" to include New York and possibly New Jersey and<br/>
Pennsylvania as well. New York seems to waver between the northeast<br/>
ans mid-atlantic regions. Well, what does everyone else think? You can<br/>
email me off-list if you would like at Sailor (underscore) Mystique<br/>
(at) hotmail (dot) com. After all, if we're going to make a logo, it<br/>
should have the states on it right?<br/>

relative to NY and CA and to have as many boxes as they do, they<br/>
should just break apart.<br/>
