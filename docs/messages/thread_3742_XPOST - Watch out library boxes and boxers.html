support of the library and staff.  I did a letterboxing how-to  <br/>
workshop for kids there, and the staff is very supportive of it!  It  <br/>
took them a little research not to be suspicious of the idea, but  <br/>
once they figured out that it wasn't some kind of weird scam, they  <br/>
were really intrigued.  They often tell me how respectful and nice  <br/>
the visiting letterboxers are.  Hooray for us!<br/>
