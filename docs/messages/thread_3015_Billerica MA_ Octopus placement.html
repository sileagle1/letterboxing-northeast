of happy little kids and their Moms.  The water park is free, it has <br/>
sprays &amp; falling water.  parking was free when I was there (probably <br/>
free all the time, but I was not there on a weekend).<br/>
<br/>
If you have small children, one of these hot muggy days would be a nice <br/>
time to visit.<br/>
<br/>
BTW - this placement is a bit harder than average, if you try it, don't <br/>
be afraid to email for help.  The two hitchhikers there need to move on <br/>
(they seem to be in the hardest box).  Don't worry about leaving a <br/>
replacement if you want to take one.  If a HH has been there less than <br/>
a month, please leave at least one in the hostel.<br/>
<br/>
Thank-you,<br/>
