If the clues are on the web site the boxes are probably in place, <br/>
especially now that it is so easy for the placer to update or delete <br/>
the clues as needed.<br/>

  I don't know where you got this information from, but it is not true.  The Old Newgate Prison Boxes were never abandoned or taken over by anyone else.  Also the clues are still available under the SAME name.  We are planning on retiring this series soon, but it depends on when we can get up there.  Probably not until sometime in May.<br/>

</span></blockquote>If you don't already have these stamps, folks, go out<br/>
and get them. This series is among the most treasured<br/>
in our logbooks, both for the skill of the carvings,<br/>
the hiding places, and the spectacular views! Hell, we<br/>
might drag a friend of ours out there so she can get<br/>
them, and have a great excuse to visit them one more<br/>
time.<br/>
