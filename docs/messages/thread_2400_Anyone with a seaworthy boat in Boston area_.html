Does any letterboxer have a boat that could go out to the Boston Harbor Islands?  I (and perhaps the others) would be willing to help us go between the islands?<br/>

You never know what you might find.... ;-)<br/>

say whether the area where the Lady in Black is would be boarded up<br/>
early ... but my initial hunch says no.<br/>
<br/>
She is not in an obvious place ... until, of course, you find that<br/>
corridor (in other words, the corridor is obvious when you find it,<br/>
but it is not obvious to find -- you have to explore EVERY part of the<br/>
fort before you'll discover it).<br/>
<br/>
E-mail me offline and let me know where in the fort you went.  I'm<br/>
curious to know where you looked and where you may not have.  When you<br/>
send me the e-mail, let me know if where, if any, parts of the fort<br/>
that were boarded -- that will let me know if the Lady in Black is<br/>
unaccessible.<br/>
