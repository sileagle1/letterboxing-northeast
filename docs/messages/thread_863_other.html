visitors. If any of you go and search for this, please take care as there is a fallen <br/>
tree upon the "umbrella" - luckily, the box can be reached, is safe and sound in it's <br/>
hiding spot, you just need to head around the trail on your right to search.<br/>

<br/>
Also - no visitors to "Surgo Ut Prosim" mystery box.... seems as though this is the <br/>
toughest box yet. Here is the clue to that one...<a href="http://home.gwi.net/~moxie1/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://home.gwi.net/~moxie1/</a><br/>
