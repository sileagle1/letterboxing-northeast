leave a little something behind when I was in North Bennington. Have a<br/>
look-see on LbNA for the clue. <br/>
<br/>
I also checked on my Hip Hop and Let's Play boxes while I was there<br/>
and found that Let's Play needs a new book. I have one in the works<br/>
and am wondering if there is anyone going that way some time in the<br/>
future who would be willing to add it to the box?<br/>
<br/>
I also found Little Lost Frost in my travels and have to say that the<br/>
stamp is wonderful. I really look forward to finding more stamps made<br/>
by Kittens Without Mittens in the future. Funhog</div>
