last week in Rhode Island! I didn't get nearly as many boxes as I'd <br/>
hoped to find (I came away with 13 and a hitchhiker), but I have to <br/>
keep in mind that my letterboxing companion had bronchitis and wasn't <br/>
up to hiking miles and miles each day. We mainly stuck around the <br/>
Bristol/Newport/Little Compton area. Many of the hiding spots <br/>
showcased gorgeous RI scenery and so many of the stamps were <br/>
beautiful!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who offered suggestions about where to box up there and <br/>
who helped me out - I greatly appreciate it! I can't wait to return!<br/>
