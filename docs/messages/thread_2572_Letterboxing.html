I just had to share this glowing email. Really, it<br/>
made my heart soar when I read it, first because they<br/>
were the FIRST PEOPLE in over 2 years of letterboxing<br/>
that got my trail name right away. Secondly they are<br/>
NEW BOXERS IN BANGOR MAINE! ahahahahahah ...my plan is<br/>
working...slowly!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, read on - and I'd say that these are the kind<br/>
of people that I'm happy to welcome into our hobby.<br/>
I'm also going to meet with her to introduce a<br/>
questing and/or letterboxing element into their<br/>
curriculum. I've been mulling this over for the past<br/>
couple of years, and had even hosted a workshop at<br/>
UMaine and Chewonki to no avail...no teachers bit that<br/>
offer, so finally someone is interested in making this<br/>
happen and I'm SO excited! can you tell?!? :) <br/>

&gt; First I would like to thank you. You have done an<br/>
&gt; amazing job with the letterboxes placed around the<br/>
&gt; Bangor area. My son and I are new to letterboxing<br/>
&gt; and we thought we might confirm the presents of our<br/>
&gt; most recent finds.<br/>

&gt; I'm a middle school science teacher and it would be<br/>
&gt; interesting to have someone come in and talk to my<br/>
&gt; science club about letterboxing. I have no idea who<br/>
&gt; you are but my friend (a 5th grade teacher) and I<br/>
&gt; were thinking you might be a professor or graduate<br/>
&gt; student at U.Maine possibly in Marine Science or<br/>
&gt; Ecology (Phyto as in plankton). We are probably way<br/>
&gt; off but we would like to thank you for all the time<br/>
&gt; and effort you have invested in this project. My<br/>
&gt; friend, our kids and I are completely hooked.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you,<br/>
