Boxers came from 3 states, CT, RI and NY. It was great seeing a lot of our letterboxing friends again and a half dozen new faces. I was able to get several new exchanges a personal traveler and the box stamp. The box stamp was excellent. Great carving job, it was really impressive. Coming into the mall it wasn't too hard to figure out where all the letterboxers were. My first sight was seeing these people sitting crouched on the floor in a group. It just had to be letterboxers. It was a nice night. Glad we went and thanks again Domedreamers for making it possible......Chuck and Chickabirdie  <br/>
