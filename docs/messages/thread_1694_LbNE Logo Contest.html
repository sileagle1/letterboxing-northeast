<br/>
<br/>
Just a reminder to get your votes in by midnight, tomorrow - December <br/>
23, at which time the polls will be closed on the LbNE Logo Contest. <br/>
<br/>
We'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of our logo designers <br/>
for their creative efforts and wish them all the best of luck in the <br/>
final outcome.<br/>
<br/>
Look for the announcement of the new clothing line, sporting the <br/>
winning entry, sometime soon. I have offered Wolfy a page or 2 on our <br/>
site where you may order items, view colors, etc.<br/>
<br/>
And - don't forget - <br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
<br/>
