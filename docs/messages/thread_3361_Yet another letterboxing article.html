                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-160345004">I hesitate to share anything about this article, as I have been the <br/>
target of wrath on this board before, but as someone who was <br/>
interviewed for the article, I feel I should set a couple of things <br/>
straight.<br/>
<br/>
#1 ~ The clues quoted in the story belong to a latterbox placed by <br/>
one of the people interviewed for the article ~ a personal friend of <br/>
mine.  She is one of the people pictured in the photograph. I <br/>
suspect that, especially in New England, there are lots of <br/>
letterboxes in wooded areas with stone pillars and stone walls, but <br/>
in this case the reporter had found the box, contacted the placer <br/>
about the interview and went back to the site with the placer to <br/>
take the photo for the article.<br/>
<br/>
#2 ~ The reporter made a point to stress the importance of being <br/>
secretive and rehiding well.  He also directed people to the web <br/>
sites and to the advice for beginners.<br/>
<br/>
#3 ~ The reporter had done some letterboxing himself and wanted to <br/>
share this new-found hobby with others.<br/>
<br/>
#4 ~ I thought he was actually rather clever in showing photos that <br/>
were totally unrelated to illustrate the article.  Again, I know the <br/>
people shown opening the letterbox. and the location, as well as the <br/>
directions, have nothing whatsoever to do with the Penobscot Narrows <br/>
box.<br/>
<br/>
#5 ~ The reporter was going to write the article whether anyone <br/>
talked with him or not, because he was excited about letterboxing.  <br/>
At least 3 out of the 4 people interviewed talked at length with him <br/>
about the importance of NOT divulging any identifying information <br/>
because of the threat of vandalism to boxes.<br/>
<br/>
If this article upset people, I fear there isn't an article that can <br/>
be written that won't offend.  The reality is that letterboxing is <br/>
out there in the public eye.  If a reporter discovers the hobby and <br/>
decides to write about it, I would like to think that by talking <br/>
with him and really stressing the importance of not giving away <br/>
locations, the article may have been less harmful to the hobby than <br/>
if he had been left to his own ideas with no input from people who <br/>
care about the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
I fully expect to be ripped apart on this message board as I have <br/>
been in the past, but I felt a need to give another side to the <br/>
story.<br/>

a pretty good job, honestly. I figured he had permission to take the<br/>
pictures (or hoped he did) I do know that the Peacock's Pandora is<br/>
pretty much left there (or at least I never got any response when I<br/>
emailed them several years ago) <br/>
<br/>
Sangfroid really thought about whether to contribute or not. On one<br/>
hand, he didn't want to be part of an article "exposing" letterboxing<br/>
(esp. due to the nature of placing boxes around MDI) and on the other<br/>
he hoped he could add an angle to an article so that people would<br/>
understand that the "hobby" has many dimensions and people need to be<br/>
responsible. In the end, he decided that his boxing style is to go<br/>
"under the radar" so he felt speaking for an interview would not be in<br/>
his best interest.<br/>
<br/>
I was THRILLED that they interviewed Memlilli! Her boxes are the first<br/>
I found and the series mentioned in the article is fantastic.<br/>
<br/>
My concern is just general publicity, but I plan on doing more mystery<br/>
and WOM anyway, and I was also concerned by the mention that you can<br/>
hike in ACadia and find 4 or 5 boxes right off the trail (which isn't<br/>
cool because boxes aren't allowed in Acadia at all)<br/>
<br/>
Mainly, I wanted to just let you all know about the article because<br/>
there are so many great boxes up here and this is the first article<br/>
about boxing in the area.<br/>

&gt; I hesitate to share anything about this article, as I have been the <br/>
&gt; target of wrath on this board before, but as someone who was <br/>
&gt; interviewed for the article, I feel I should set a couple of things <br/>
&gt; straight.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; #1 ~ The clues quoted in the story belong to a latterbox placed by <br/>
&gt; one of the people interviewed for the article ~ a personal friend of <br/>
&gt; mine.  She is one of the people pictured in the photograph. I <br/>
&gt; suspect that, especially in New England, there are lots of <br/>
&gt; letterboxes in wooded areas with stone pillars and stone walls, but <br/>
&gt; in this case the reporter had found the box, contacted the placer <br/>
&gt; about the interview and went back to the site with the placer to <br/>
&gt; take the photo for the article.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; #2 ~ The reporter made a point to stress the importance of being <br/>
&gt; secretive and rehiding well.  He also directed people to the web <br/>
&gt; sites and to the advice for beginners.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; #3 ~ The reporter had done some letterboxing himself and wanted to <br/>
&gt; share this new-found hobby with others.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; #4 ~ I thought he was actually rather clever in showing photos that <br/>
&gt; were totally unrelated to illustrate the article.  Again, I know the <br/>
&gt; people shown opening the letterbox. and the location, as well as the <br/>
&gt; directions, have nothing whatsoever to do with the Penobscot Narrows <br/>
&gt; box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; #5 ~ The reporter was going to write the article whether anyone <br/>
&gt; talked with him or not, because he was excited about letterboxing.  <br/>
&gt; At least 3 out of the 4 people interviewed talked at length with him <br/>
&gt; about the importance of NOT divulging any identifying information <br/>
&gt; because of the threat of vandalism to boxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If this article upset people, I fear there isn't an article that can <br/>
&gt; be written that won't offend.  The reality is that letterboxing is <br/>
&gt; out there in the public eye.  If a reporter discovers the hobby and <br/>
&gt; decides to write about it, I would like to think that by talking <br/>
&gt; with him and really stressing the importance of not giving away <br/>
&gt; locations, the article may have been less harmful to the hobby than <br/>
&gt; if he had been left to his own ideas with no input from people who <br/>
&gt; care about the hobby.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I fully expect to be ripped apart on this message board as I have <br/>
&gt; been in the past, but I felt a need to give another side to the <br/>
&gt; story.<br/>

letterboxes are set "free" and become public property where by right <br/>

The only thing that really disappoints us with the photograph in the<br/>

We would like to acknowledge that the article was very well written, <br/>
one of the better that we have seen. We found it to be responsible <br/>
and informative, thereby minimizing the negative impact to the hobby <br/>

It would have been a different story if my stamp was shown sans<br/>

Beswick, I'm disappointed that they showed your stamp for I haven't<br/>
had a chance to find it, and I'd bet that there is a greater chance<br/>
that your box will go missing as a result.<br/>

We (Magic Tree House Gang) first started boxing after reading an article on letterboxing.  Since then we like to think that we have been good letterboxers.  We have not only found boxes, but planted 5 as well (1 for each month we have boxed).  It is a great way to get my two young children (5 and 4) to love the outdoors and to learn the way to be responsible when on the trails.  They have learned more about nature and hiking then I could have imagined.  My son pointed a hemlock out to my husband whose jaw dropped. With the lack of exercise and the problems with childhood obesity facing America, I welcome anything that could get kids to enjoy outdoor activity young.  Anyway, just for 2 cents.  I just think there is a middle ground between not introducing new people and not taking<br/>
 care in these articles to protect the boxes that are already there.<br/>
