Colchester Ct today.  This is a box Amy and I have wanted for some <br/>
time but have been unable to lay our hands on it.  Thanks again for <br/>
the special chance to get the box.  It was also wonderful to get to <br/>
meet some wonderful letterboxers as well, Kstar, Flutterby and QueenB <br/>
where all there and exchanges where made as well as new friends.  It <br/>
was a true delight to get a chance to sit and talk with other <br/>
letterboxers. We hope to see you all at the MMM, here shortly.  <br/>
Thanks again for a great afternoon stop over.<br/>
<br/>
Patrick and Thomas, (Miss Amy was called at the last minute into work <br/>
on an emergency)<br/>
