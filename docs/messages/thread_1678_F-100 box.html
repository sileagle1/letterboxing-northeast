The long awaited F-100 box arrived!<br/>
A long list of names came with it - Are you on this List?<br/>
Contact me very quickly and maybe we can have a mini gathering.<br/>
I live here in Jamestown, RI; but am willing to drive a bit - depending on how many people on this list are free this weekend.<br/>
I would like to get the box on it's way to the next mail recipient (unknown at this time) as soon as possible.<br/>

<br/>
I am on the list for the F100 box.  Is this Scoutdogs box or <br/>
Mapsurfers box?  there are two F100 boxes.  I have done Mapsurfers <br/>
box but have not done Scoutdogs box.  I would love to get together <br/>
for a mini gathering to sign in.  I only live 20 minutes from <br/>
Jamestown.  Let me know.<br/>
