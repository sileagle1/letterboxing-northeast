A 12-year old girl, lsabella Oleschuk, has been missing from her home here in my town of Orange, Connecticut since Sunday morning.<br/>
<br/>
Could you please keep your eyes and ears peeled as you hike and letterbox, or just go about your daily routine?  She could be anywhere at this point.<br/>
<br/>
Please take a minute to click on this link to the articles from WTNH Channel 8 News and see her picture and description:<br/>

Many thanks, and please keep Isabella and her family in your thoughts and prayers as officials and volunteers continue their search for her.<br/>
