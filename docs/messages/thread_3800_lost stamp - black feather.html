<br/>
I haven't boxed in a while, probably since the Monster Mash.  (I know that is a shocker to all you die hards)  I was going through my stuff, getting ready to journey out again, check on my babies, etc.. and I noticed I am missing a hand-carved stamp of a feather.  It was on a Factis eraser so about 2"x1".  <br/>
<br/>
I know it's a long shot but if anyone has it please let me know.  TIA<br/>
<br/>
Fisher (and family)    <br/>

I definitely didn't find it at the Monster Mash, or anywhere else for that matter.<br/>
<br/>
If you are unable to find it, I will gladly carve you a replacement if you'd like.<br/>
