abandoned by its owner and has been taken over by spammers. Since the <br/>
owner can't be reached, I've worked with Yahoo to get them to agree <br/>
to assign a new moderator for the group so that we can save the <br/>
historical archives and messages. In order for that to happen, the <br/>
group must elect a new moderator, so there is now a poll going on at <br/>
the site for that purpose. We've had a couple of volunteers step up <br/>
from the remaining members.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is a member of the group, please vote here before June 11:<br/>
