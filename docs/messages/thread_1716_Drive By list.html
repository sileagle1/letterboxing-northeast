                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1951617170">still wondering if that drive by list is going to be accessible to <br/>
the genderal LBing population or if it has now been classified <br/>
as "Event Only" list of clues for the Drive By Gathering on the <br/>
16th. A non-hiker friend of mine loves the idea of letterboxing, but <br/>
isn't much of a hiker and would love to find the easy drive bys with <br/>
her kids! <br/>
<br/>
Yes, of course, she could research it herself, but hey, if its out <br/>
there already, why not?! One aspect I like about Atlas Quest...hte <br/>
icons!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-853888780">I have the Hartford and Tolland County drive-by lists.  The only reason I haven't sent them out to the group at large is that I've been travelling for Christmas/New Years.  It's not like they're a big secret.  Now that I'm home, I'll post it to LBNE.  I haven't made up the exact route yet of which boxes to get, but I do have a list compiled, and it's listed in alphabetical order by town.  I'll post those two counties tonight.  <br/>
