This is mostly directed to Choi, or others that might know of this<br/>
particular box. If you're not familiar with what I'm talking about,<br/>
just disregard. I don't usually read this list anymore, let alone<br/>
check the "what's new" but I happened to check the list and noticed<br/>

Well, that's kinda funny because I originally planted a box in the<br/>
SAME location about 2 years ago for the Water District. This was a box<br/>
that you need to ask permission for since the Portland Water District<br/>
property is private and there is restricted access around Sebago Lake<br/>
which is also a drinking water source. I'm quite puzzled to see that<br/>
there is a listing for essentially the SAME clue that I wrote...<br/>

<br/>
I'm puzzled and a bit bummed out, why don't people pay attention when<br/>
they plant boxes? Maine is not Connecticut folks, we don't need 50<br/>
boxes in the same location, on the SAME trail. Thankfully I am still<br/>
in good contact with the Education director at the Ecology Center and<br/>
will make her aware of this error in judgement.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, a bit disgruntled...<br/>

both Oceanwytch &amp; myself enjoyed the discovery of your box at this <br/>
location earlier this year. It is regrettable to see someone "double <br/>
up " on this great spot.....<br/>
I would have to believe that it is not only an unsanctioned box but <br/>
probably a store bought stamp as well.....<br/>
LOL<br/>

I may investigate it this week on on of my off days ...<br/>

I actually received an email from the placer today. She is an educator<br/>
from the water district who apparently didn't do her homework before<br/>
giving away the location for my box. The concept of my clue was to<br/>
hint at the location to obtain the next clue which leads you to my<br/>
box. What she posted on the web was the next clue (!)???? So, anyway -<br/>
to make a long story short, I gave her the lodown.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like she just got back from a workshop on questing, but they<br/>
clearly didn't edumacate her on letterboxing and the difference<br/>
betwixt the two. Egad, yet another thing to blabber on about, but I<br/>
appreciate you stepping in. <br/>
<br/>
Isosceles had a very valid point today. To the untrained boxer, aka-<br/>
"newbie", the LBNA site is quite simplistic. If you're willing to go<br/>
the mile and scratch beneath the surface, there is another layer to<br/>
the onion. The mystery clues, the bonus boxes never published, the<br/>
multitudes of different clue writing styles and all the wonderful<br/>
eccentricities of boxing that originally attracted me to this hobby. I<br/>
sometimes get sad when I think of all the other good stuff people miss.  <br/>
