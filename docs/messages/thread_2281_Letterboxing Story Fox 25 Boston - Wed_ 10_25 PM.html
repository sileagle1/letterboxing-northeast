letterboxing near the end of their 10 O'clock news tomorrow night. The Haley<br/>
Family from Pembroke, MA and I were interviewed for the story. I took the<br/>
crew for a hike to see my Minute Man letterbox. I'm thinking of relocating<br/>
it tomorrow morning... just in case.<br/>

<br/>
She contacted us to do an interview as well.  I turned her down.  My <br/>
main reason for that is because everytime there is some publicity about <br/>
LBing everyone gets all upset about it.  I honestly didn't want to be <br/>
on the receiving end of that garbage.  I don't know if attention hurts <br/>
our hobby or not, but I'm glad someone was able to help the person from <br/>
Fox 25. I felt badly for saying no.  <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing your "15 minutes of fame" (sounds like a new <br/>
box title for ya!).<br/>
<br/>
Be well,<br/>

Seniors (a sailboat class) and what I saw in the prelim's was <br/>
impressive, altho sailing is not a 'hidden' sport, and he has been <br/>
working on it for 18 months! <br/>
 I could have mentioned the `hobby' (obsession) to him, but then there <br/>
would be the `exposure'  <br/>
I only hope the 'reporter' shows the same deliberation and thoroughness <br/>
of the `hobby' of Lbing that my friend did to his story  <br/>
<br/>
We can only hope...     <br/>
