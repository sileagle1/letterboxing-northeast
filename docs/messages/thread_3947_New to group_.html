this year... and the first one listed for next year is Jiffy's Tour <br/>
of the Fort.  Others will be Kites by HappyDaze and I'm co-hosting a <br/>
camping weekend event in August.  The big event will be Frightnight <br/>
5 - it should be a huge event... can't wait to see what Koko pulls <br/>
out of his hat this time.<br/>
<br/>
More locally to you are Ldyslpa, MEPANJ, and Follow the Sun... they <br/>
are all out of Skowhegan.  Razzy Raz and Robin's Nest are also in <br/>
your boxing range I believe!<br/>

Have fun!<br/>
