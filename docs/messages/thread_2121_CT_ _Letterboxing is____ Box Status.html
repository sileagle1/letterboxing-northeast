Goshen on Memorial Day.  The weather was beautiful and the waterfall <br/>
area at the end was gorgeously lit.  We had a great deal of trouble <br/>
finding box number 9 ... and after a half hour's search of the area we <br/>
were just about to give up, when I spotted a bit of pink gleaming from <br/>
the leaf litter!  <br/>
<br/>
The container had been crunched open and the poor stamp showed <br/>
thousands of teeny tiny chew marks, leaving for a rather interesting <br/>
micro-tooth-carved stamp impression!  Not knowing better to do, we <br/>
placed the stamp and remains of the container into a plastic bag and re-<br/>
hid it according to the clues, with the addition of softball sized rock <br/>
on top of it to inhibit the critter from absconding with it again.  <br/>
We're afraid the container needs to be replaced, but we were thankful <br/>
the stamp was found!  It might be good to weight down the other <br/>
containers.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for a wonderful and delighfully amusing series!  <br/>
