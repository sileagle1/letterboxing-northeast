 What is your feeling about placing some sort of "time needed" on <br/>
letterboxing clues? Does anyone out there feel it takes something <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  What is your feeling about placing some sort of "time needed" on <br/>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>In my own experience I have stayed away from putting a time needed on<br/>
the clue for a number of personal reasons.<br/>
<br/>
First of all because everyone's own style of boxing varies. Someone<br/>
with children might take 3 times as long. As I don't have children, I<br/>
can't be a good judge of that time needed. As someone who has taught<br/>
children and led countless nature hikes, I can guess that it would<br/>
take longer, but out of fairness - I don't put that time because I<br/>
honestly don't know.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, a casual hiker versus someone who is on a boxing mission are<br/>
two different things. Usually I hike to view nature, and that takes<br/>
time. When you're in the city however and doing urban boxes - it can<br/>
be understood that you've gotta be slick and stamping in should be<br/>
done quickly and the clue should be somewhat straightforward.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, if someone can't figure out from the clue or a personal<br/>
contact or research ahead of time how long it's going to take, then<br/>
they can always opt not to find that box or come back to it another<br/>
time when they can spend as much time as they want or is needed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does anyone out there feel it takes something <br/>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>No - but it's just like reading on a database:"easy drive by" when<br/>
it's not in the clue at all...it sort of gives it away.<br/>
<br/>
In general I don't think about the time it takes to get a box. If I<br/>
start early enough it's not a problem, I'm not usually ever pressed<br/>
for time unless it's already dusk when I start, and then it's my own<br/>
fault for not bringing a flashlight or headlamp (which I usually bring)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you ever decide which boxes to do or not do.. <br/>
&gt; based upon time needed? <br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>No - but I/we always thoroughly read the clues and/or research the<br/>
area and trail before heading out so that we feel somewhat prepared.<br/>
In New England I'm fairly familiar with most areas, so I feel as<br/>
though I have a good handle on how long it would take.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

</span></blockquote>You know the saying--"It's the thought that counts"?  =)  I like the <br/>
concept, but the implementation generally isn't very good because <br/>
there can be such a wide variation between hiking speeds among <br/>
letterboxers.  I'd much rather have concrete distances and elevation <br/>
gains mentioned in the clue so I can figure out how long it should <br/>
take me to do.<br/>
<br/>
I also tend to add a one-word summary of the terrain difficulty in <br/>
my clues (easy, medium, hard, strenuous, whatever).  It's more of a <br/>
subjective measure, but I also include a link where people can get a <br/>
rough idea of what I think is "easy", "medium", etc.  I'm thinking <br/>
about eliminating it, though, since it doesn't seem to add anything <br/>
that anyone thinks is useful.  And I get plenty of people that <br/>
say, "But sheeze!  Your EASY hikes take me all freaking day!!!!"  <br/>
But with the trail's length and elevation gain mentioned right next <br/>
to it, it's pretty stupid of me to throw out my subjective opinions <br/>
about the trail difficulty.<br/>
<br/>
Not that it hasn't stopped me....  =)<br/>

Obviously, I can make it through a hike like Avery Tract (3 hours) in <br/>
way under that time, but it is because I am familiar with the land. <br/>
I've had boxes listed as "1/2 hour" take us 2 hours because the clues <br/>
were vague.  Its just a general guideline and should be taken at face <br/>
value. <br/>
<br/>
As far as segregating hikes based upon time, why would you NOT do <br/>
that??  I work a lot of night shifts and a lot of my hiking is done <br/>
in the afternoon where you may have 2 or 3 hours daylight left. <br/>
Saving shorter hikes for those days works well. When I have a full <br/>
day available, I do longer hikes or multiple boxes in an area.  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps if you do not want to commit to a time frame on your clues <br/>
you can say something more like "3 miles strenuous hiking with steep <br/>
elevation" versus "1/2 mile round trip, flat terrain".   Thats a big <br/>
help and I know how quick I can get a rough mile done on different <br/>
terrains.  <br/>

be walking or hiking, especially now that it's winter! My boyfriend <br/>
and I went to get a box recently that was in a state park, but the <br/>
park was closed for the winter. By the time we actually got to the <br/>
starting point, having already walked about a mile in the snow, we <br/>
realized we had 2.9 more miles to go and decided to save it for the <br/>
spring. <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1080942882">Hi Kstar.  In my clues, I generally give the time it takes me to do <br/>
the hike or else the distance, if I know it.  I am a slow <br/>
walker/hiker, so in general other people do hikes in less time <br/>
than I do.  By the same token, I appreciate being given the <br/>
approx. distance or time in a clue when I hunt for boxes. I usually <br/>
figure it will take me a bit longer 'cause I am not a speedy hiker.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes try to work out a plan to do several boxes in one <br/>
day.  Knowing the estimated time it takes to find a box helps me <br/>
decide which boxes to do that day and in what order.<br/>
<br/>
However, I have learned to be flexible and not get my heart set on <br/>
anything going according to plan.  The more flexible and open to <br/>
the unexpected I am, the more I enjoy letterboxing.  A couple of <br/>
weeks ago I went on a hike that took about twice as long as I <br/>
anticipated and I never did find the box, but I didn't mind at all, as <br/>
it was a beautiful place and an exhilarating winter walk.  I'll try <br/>
there again in dry weather when the landmarks are not hidden <br/>
under snow!<br/>

</span></blockquote>Bonnie you bring up a very important point that I missed before. <br/>
Thank you for clarifying that it is in the art of clue writing that <br/>
one (the placer of a box) establishes who the "intended audience" is <br/>
for the box. If the audience in question cannot figure out which <br/>
boxes are for him/her then they should move on.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure I can phrase that in any pc form other than I agree with <br/>

standards in mind when writing my future clues. <br/>
This way people can make an informed decision about whether a <br/>
particular box is right for them, or not. <br/>
Now, is this a dumb question.. ? <br/>
when walking, how do you know how far you've walked? <br/>
Trails zig and zag so much.  Do you just know by instinct? OR do you <br/>
always take time to measure it out on a map?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   I'd much rather have concrete distances and elevation <br/>
&gt; gains mentioned in the clue so I can figure out how long it should <br/>
&gt; take me to do.<br/>
&gt; I also tend to add a one-word summary of the <br/>
</span></blockquote>terrain difficulty in <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; my clues (easy, medium, hard, strenuous, whatever).  <br/>
</span></blockquote>It's more of a subjective measure,<br/>
 but I also include a link where people can get <br/>
a rough idea of what I think is "easy", "medium", etc.  <br/>

</span></blockquote>Most of the time, I try to find an official source that shows the <br/>
distance.  A trail map, guide book, or on the Internet.  If all else <br/>
fails, I'm pretty good at estimating the distance based on how long <br/>
it takes me to walk.  While everyone tends to hike at different <br/>
speeds, the same person tends to walk at the same pace whereever <br/>
they go.  With rugged or steep terrain, I may move at two miles per <br/>
hour.  With flat, easy terrain, I may fly by at three miles per <br/>
hour.  So if you know how long you've been walking, you can estimate <br/>
how far you've walked.<br/>
<br/>
Pedometers are kind of fun to play with too.  They count how many <br/>
steps you've taken, so if you know your stride (easily measurable), <br/>
they'll give a pretty good estimate of the actual distance <br/>
traveled.  Keep in mind that even with a pedometer, different <br/>
terrain require different strides, even for the same person.<br/>
<br/>
But like I said before, an official source for trail lengths is <br/>
usually easy to find on a map, book, or Internet.  But pedometers <br/>
are FUN!  =)<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1597268736">I agree with Rustypuff.  I like to see distances rather than time but <br/>
in lieu of distance time is good.  Descriptions are very helpful <br/>
too.  True that everyone hikes at different rates, but I use a time <br/>
listed in a clue as a guideline, not an absolute.  If the clue says 1 <br/>
hour to complete I wouldn't expect it to take me 5 hours but I would <br/>
not be surprised if it took up to 2 hours.  <br/>
<br/>
Do I use time/distance listed when selecting a letterbox? <br/>
Absolutely.  I start early in the morning and go all day.  I try to <br/>
plan my most demanding hikes early in the day and the easier hikes in <br/>
the afternoon.  I don't plan on being out after dark (especially in <br/>
January.)<br/>
<br/>
Safety is another consideration.  I recently had someone say to me <br/>
that a letterbox hike they did was much longer than they thought it <br/>
would be from reading the clues.  (no distance or time was given)  <br/>
They had two children with them and would have picked a different <br/>
hike if they had realized how long it was.  There are a lot of people <br/>
letterboxing.  Not all these people have the level of "woodsmanship" <br/>
that you would expect from a typical hiker.  They may over estimate <br/>
their abilites or underestimate the difficulty of a hike.  Or they <br/>
just might make a mistake.  Giving them guidance is at least helpful. <br/>
<br/>
Everyone has a different approach to writing their letterbox clues.  <br/>
I think that is one of the beauties of the sport, how much creativity <br/>
and individualism there is.  In general, my letterboxes are not <br/>
difficult and provide the letterboxer with very unambiguous <br/>
information.  That is my style.  Others enjoy making their boxes <br/>
mysterious and more ambiguous .... that is part of the fun of doing <br/>
their boxes (and I don't just mean mystery boxes.)   So there is no <br/>
right or wrong answer to your question, just different opinions and <br/>
preferences.<br/>
<br/>
that is my very long winded opinion.<br/>

Hey, Chris have you noticed the change in my punctuation?<br/>
It's my NewYears resolution. I think I'm doing well.<br/>
Next year I'll work on my spelling. Promise!<br/>
