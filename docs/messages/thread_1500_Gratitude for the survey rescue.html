                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-240542315">To all who have read/responded to my original request regarding filling out <br/>
a letterboxing survey,<br/>
   I apologize for not posting my "credentials" in the original email. The <br/>
thought that this could be construed as a marketing ploy did not even cross <br/>
my mind. Now, however, I can see how this could be the case. I sincerely <br/>
thank everyone who came to my rescue and spread the word that this is not in <br/>
any way related to marketing. I assure you that this survey is for the <br/>
educational purposes that I have outlined and nothing more. I made sure that <br/>
I did not ask for any identifying information to try to alleviate any of <br/>
these concerns that could arise. As far as my "credentials" are concerned, I <br/>
am a freshman majoring in Secondary English Education at Rhode Island <br/>
College. I have been letterboxing for about a year and a half. I have met <br/>
many of those who came to my defense at gatherings in the past. Please know <br/>
that I do not hold a grudge against anyone who looked at my survey with <br/>
suspicion. I consider it an oversight on my part that I did not post this <br/>
information before I sent out my request for responses. Also, please <br/>
remember that this information will be used for a field study on the culture <br/>
of letterboxers and the sport itself and most definitely NOT for any other <br/>
purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone,<br/>
Erin aka Mystique<br/>
