I am technically in the Northeast (I think!), but not from New <br/>
England as most of you are. Being new to LB, I've read with interest <br/>
on the "big list" how active states such as CT and RI are with the <br/>
hobby. I only wish that my own state of PA was as active! <br/>
<br/>
Now, once the weather gets a bit warmer, I plan on planting all sorts <br/>
of boxes that are currently in the works. Besides that, though, do <br/>
any of you avid boxers have any suggestions for turning an LB poor <br/>
environment/state (for the most part) into a more active, LB rich <br/>
environment?<br/>

Let me know if you need help on that Wednesday.<br/>
<br/>
Hold a workshop, do a booth at an environmental fair, contact local<br/>
school-girl-boy scout troops and generate interest on that level. If<br/>
you're not in the environmental education field you could just plug<br/>
boxing to all your friends and family.<br/>
<br/>
or you could do a "leger" (aka Legerdemaine)<br/>
and post little slips of paper on bulletin boards at libraries, post<br/>
offices, community locales that have either the word: Letterboxing on<br/>
the paper or a link to the web or a page of your own making. You could<br/>
go to your local art supply store and talk it up and perhaps they'd<br/>
let you make a little display with the section of carving materials.<br/>
<br/>
Just some ideas!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1999943160">Hi Kathryn,<br/>
<br/>
I feel fortunate that I live in Rhode Island where there are so many <br/>
letterboxes.  I was down in New Jersey over Columbus day weekend and <br/>
did some nice boxes in New Jersey and near by Pennsylvania (Delaware <br/>
Water Gap.)  Silent Doug plants boxes in PA.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here are some of my ideas:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Get your local newspaper to do an article on letterboxing.  Both <br/>
the Providence Journal in RI and the Hartford Courant in CT have done <br/>
nice articles on letterboxing.  Get a journalist who will go out on <br/>
the trail with you and take pictures and really play it up.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Organize a gathering in your area and put the word out <br/>
publically.  <br/>
<br/>
3.  Is there and EMS store or equivalent outdoors store in your <br/>
area?  Try to get them involved (this is also a good bulletin board <br/>
place for postings)<br/>
<br/>
4.  Are there any land trusts or other organizations in your area <br/>
with newsletters?  That's how I first heard about letterboxing over 2 <br/>
years ago.  Someone had planted boxes in a land trust and the land <br/>
trust newsletter did an article on the boxes.  My friend read the <br/>
article and told me we should go do letterboxing.  Then I heard that <br/>
EMS had clues for letterboxes at their stores in CT. Also, the <br/>
Federal Wildlife Refuge across the street from my house has the clues <br/>
to their letterbox right out in plain site at their vistors center.  <br/>
Lots of people walk through there and see the clues and ask about it. <br/>
(PS the box is padlocked to prevent vandalism and you must do <br/>
the "quest" to figure out the combination to the letterbox lock.)<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Yes, I do.  I first started letterboxing at my home in RI in 2001.  <br/>
When I returned to my home in Central MA, there was only *one* <br/>
letterbox in Central MA - Bonsai.  I quickly started to create and <br/>
plant boxes along the 495 route.  If you plant them, they will come.<br/>
<br/>
Look at Central MA now!<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, if you plant a whole bunch of boxes in an area, and <br/>
folks who are just itching to see new letterboxes come to play hide <br/>
and seek, they are often enthralled by the area and come back to <br/>
plant their own.<br/>
<br/>
But your mileage may vary.<br/>

Erie, so I will give him the carving stuff with the stipulation that he plant a<br/>

If I ever get to go meet his parents, I'll plant all the way there. : )<br/>

Phyto's suggestions were just super. I definitely recommend talking to Girl<br/>

I very strongly believe in the first law of<br/>
letterboxing. "Plant, and they will come!"<br/>
<br/>
When we got involved in this hobby two years ago,<br/>
there were about 70 boxes in Western MA. Since then,<br/>
we've planted about 40 more, with the hoped for<br/>
results. The more boxes there are in an area, the more<br/>
likely it is that new people will stick around long<br/>
enough to plant a box or three. <br/>

announced yet! <br/>
For those of you who have been wondering what the heck she is talking<br/>
about, we do a program series called "Lunch and Learns" at the Wells<br/>
Reserve where volunteers, staff, and community members make an<br/>
informal presentation on a topic of interest that is at least vaguely<br/>
related to nature and the environment. People bring a bag lunch and we<br/>
provide them with free dessert and drinks if they bring a reuseable mug. <br/>
I decided that I would do one on letterboxing to try and get some more<br/>
people interested in it and to promote the boxes that we have on site<br/>
and in southern Maine. I've included the description below (notice the<br/>
similarity to the description on the LBNA site?)in case anyone is<br/>
interested in helping or you know someone who might be interested in<br/>
learning more about letterboxing. I am fairly new to the hobby myself,<br/>

Lunch and Learn: Letterboxing <br/>
Wed, Apr 28, noon to 1 pm<br/>
Letterboxing is an intriguing outdoor hobby that combines treasure<br/>
hunting, orienteering, hiking, and art. Interested individuals hide a<br/>
box containing a logbook and a carved stamp in a beautiful,<br/>
interesting, or sometimes remote location, then compose clues that are<br/>
posted to a website. Letterboxing has something for everyone; people<br/>
of all ages and backgrounds participate. Come learn the history of<br/>
this unique pastime, discover how to become involved, and view some<br/>
stunning carved images collected on the trail. Laura Lubelczyk, Wells<br/>
Reserve education director and letterboxing enthusiast, presents this<br/>
program. Bring and bag lunch and a mug for free drinks.<br/>
Reservations are requested for this free program. Please call (207)<br/>
646-1555.<br/>
<br/>
As this description will appear in our calendar, it doesn't include<br/>
information on where it will be held, so here it is:<br/>
This program will be held in the Mather Auditorium at the Wells<br/>
National Estuarine Research Reserve at Laudholm Farm located in Wells,<br/>
Maine. For directions, visit www.wellsreserve.org.</div>

&gt; likely it is that new people will stick around long<br/>
&gt; enough to plant a box or three. <br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>That's a good point!  But I'd also like to point out that the more <br/>
boxes there are in an area, the more people will stummble into it by <br/>
accident.  I can't begin to count the number of people that have told <br/>
me they learned about letterboxing because they discovered my clue <br/>
for a letterbox while doing a Google search for some trail or place <br/>
where I hid a letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
And then when there's a lot of boxes to find in the area--enough to <br/>
really get them hooked--the number of boxes will grow at a staggering <br/>
rate!  =)  Look at what my measly Bookstore Box managed to do to the <br/>
Central Coast of California.  Yikes!<br/>

I'm looking forward to planting a LOT of boxes once spring hits. In <br/>
the meantime, I'll have time to get them ready for planting :) <br/>
<br/>
After that I suppose I can contact local groups and let them know <br/>
about it! As it is, I tell everyone I know or meet! I think the trick <br/>
to that is to actually take them along with me on a letterbox hunt so <br/>
they can see just how much fun it is :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

</span></blockquote>One more suggestion that just came to mind. As explaining letterboxing<br/>
as a hobby can be rather involved - take extra copies of the<br/>
letterboxing fact sheet. Or make your own based on this idea.<br/>
<br/>
It can be found here: <br/>

<br/>
It has been my experience that when presenting this type of activity<br/>
to a group (especially children) that it needs to be described in a<br/>
concise manner so that all ages understand. If you're interested in<br/>
designing a quest you can find all kinds of information on questing<br/>
from the Valley Quest web page:<br/>

Best of luck to you!<br/>

wonderful  hiding holes! Then there are the unique places indoors to <br/>
hide one. I'm thinking Kaufmanns in New Holland as a spot I would put <br/>
one. Whats happening at your library story hour how about and excerpt <br/>
from Randy's new book and a box at the library that will get the kids <br/>
going. So get some waterproof boots for the holidays and maybe some <br/>
gaiters ( they're on my list) and away you go to have fun in the snow <br/>
or in the case of Ct. today a freeze over of yesterdays torrential <br/>
rain.  Carol - Leader of the Pack  coming your way in March get them <br/>
