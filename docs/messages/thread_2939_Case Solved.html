                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-5982642">Dear Fellow Letterboxers, <br/>
<br/>
 It gives me great pleasure to announce that the<br/>
Purloined PZ Kut Caper has been solved. Before the<br/>
winner is announced there are a few acknowledgments in<br/>
order. <br/>
<br/>
 Many thanks to the victim, suspects and culprit in<br/>
this mystery who participated on faith, not knowing<br/>
who was asking them to join in, nor what their role<br/>
would be. I appreciate their involvement, entertaining<br/>
banter and good sportsmanship. My hat is off to Der<br/>
Mad Stamper, Don &amp; Gwen, Stealthboxxer, Green Tortuga,<br/>
Poison Ivy, Sewsowbizzy, BarefootLucy, SpringChick,<br/>
TeamGreenDragon and Mark &amp; Sue. Without their willing<br/>
participation this little suspense for your enjoyment<br/>
would not have been possible. <br/>
<br/>
 Congratulations to RaqsEnigma whose perseverance and<br/>
many long hours has paid off in fingering none other<br/>
than Mark Pepe as the culprit. While many have<br/>
submitted guesses and logical deductions it is<br/>
RaqsEnigma who broke the code and submitted the<br/>
correct answer...... Mark Share. Conclusion is......<br/>
Mark stole the PZKut to share. <br/>
<br/>
 Sincerely, <br/>
 Investigator Francis Bacon<br/>
