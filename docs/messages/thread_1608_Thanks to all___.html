<br/>
Thanks to all of you who wrote such great comments about the stamps... it's always a nice ego boost :)  I just LOVE to carve!<br/>
<br/>
We are currently working on planting the rest of the Alphabet &amp; I Love to Read series, finishing up carving Legends of the Silver Screen and about to begin working on The Great Cookie Caper.<br/>
<br/>
Legends is a 50 box series that will be planted in Fahnestock State Park next Spring featuring caricatures of great actors and actresses of the movies.<br/>
<br/>
The Great Cookie Caper is a limited time series that will be available from January 7th 2005 until January 23rd 2005.  That's our Girl Scout Cookie Sale time.  The clues will be published at 4 PM promptly on the 7th of January (the official start time of our sale) and be taken off line at exactly 11:59PM on the 23rd.  Giving you approximately 17 days give or take a few hours to snag them all.<br/>
<br/>
The first box will be a mystery box and the other 7 will be piggybacks to each other.  If you find the first box, you'll be given a clue to the next, which will contain the clues to the next and so on.  The first 10 people to find all 8 boxes will get a free box of cookies!  All of the boxes will be placed within the confines of our Dutchess County Council and in a logical sequence so that if you ar really ambitious you can get them all in one day, provided you have a car and are willing to work hard.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to Cookies!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-182082428">So far, I've carved about 30 of the 50 stamps...have mounted about half of those.  The carving is the easy part... most carvings are completed in about an hour or so.  The mounting is the time consuming part, cutting and sanding the blocks, polyurethane, then the actual mounting... So far, I'd guess I have about 60 hours or so invested in the series... but like I said I LOVE to carve.  It's me time.. since there are 4 Baby Bandits about the place AND we homeschool, I don't get a great deal of that.  I think of it as therapy.. the kids go out after lessons to run amok, while I turn on the music and zone out... just me, pzkut and a blade!<br/>
<br/>
Many a meal has gone to the dark side for all my efforts... LOL  I've gotten into the habit of cooking dinner right after breakfast, to make sure it gets done!<br/>
