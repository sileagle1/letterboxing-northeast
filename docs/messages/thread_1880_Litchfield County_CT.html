box is still in place for me.I have been there twice looking for it <br/>
and it is the last one in the CT state stamp series that I need.I <br/>
would like to make sure it is still there before I go looking for it <br/>
again because it is a very long drive for us.Please email me if you <br/>
know the status of the box.Thanks and Happy Letterboxing!<br/>
