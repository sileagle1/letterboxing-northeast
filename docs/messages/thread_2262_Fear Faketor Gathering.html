FAKETOR Gathering the success it was!  THANK YOU to Talking Turtle and <br/>
Kreepy Kelli for all their hard work pulling this event together and <br/>
to all the people who pitched in to make the day run smoothly. <br/>
(Warcat, you ROCK at burgers and dogs!) It was so much fun to spend <br/>
the day with old boxing friends and get the chance to meet new ones.  <br/>
The boxes were plentiful AND amazing at this very cool park.  My only <br/>
regret is that I couldn't spend the weekend camping out with all the <br/>
other boxers.  I KNOW they had a BLAST!  OK, so whe is the next <br/>
gathering???</div>

hosting this gathering.  Warcat 76 had a great time even though we <br/>
only made a brief appearance.  Nice to meet so many new people and see <br/>
others we've met before.  Keep the gatherings coming!!<br/>
