<br/>
I know that there are no rules, per se, but I was wondering if you <br/>
could let me know if the following is okay or breaking LB etiquette:<br/>
<br/>
Is it okay to plant a box that's in the same (large) park as 3 other <br/>
boxes, but is really 2 miles away from the last box? I know it's not <br/>
cool to place boxes in close proximity to one another, but I don't <br/>
know if 2 miles is adequate space or not.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-110967430">We've seen boxes literally within 2 feet of one another in certain <br/>
state parks here in CT and beleive it or not -- some folks never even <br/>
notice!   2 Miles is entirely more than plenty of room.  Keep in mind <br/>
that some folks read through all the clues and do several series' at <br/>
once. Others of us like to do a series at a time and don't mind <br/>
covering the same ground going in different directions.  Mystery <br/>
boxes etc should not be counted in your "count" of close-bys, becuase <br/>
they are not technically "public" knowledge. Thats how we can have <br/>
place like Avery Land Trust where there's somewhere more than 8 boxes <br/>
in 75 square acres (actual # higher, however some secrets are made to <br/>
be kept!).   <br/>
<br/>
Just our 2 cents....<br/>
