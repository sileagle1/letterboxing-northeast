Tunxis Trail, Northern Region, Hartland- Trail Closure<br/>
Description: <br/>
Approximately 200 yards of the Tunxis Trail in the Tunxis State Forest (Route 20 parking area north to the top of the hemlock ridge above the old cellar hole- see WB Map TU-7c), will be temporarily closed to the public beginning December 23, 2010. The trail will remain closed for the duration of a DEP timber harvest. This harvest is designed to thin poorer quality trees and those that will not likely survive to the next cutting cycle (25 years from now), as well as to make canopy openings of varying size to encourage establishment of new regeneration. The harvest will also remove nonnative trees, such as plantation red pine and European larch, in favor of native species.<br/>
Please do not disturb any blue flagging on the trail and stay clear of all equipment. If you have any questions please contact CFPA.</div>
