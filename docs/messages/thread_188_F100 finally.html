better half, who was busy at work. With both husband and wife being <br/>
nurses, letterbox coordination has been difficult. So, dad and the <br/>
kids did lunch and then found Rubaduc's "Capen Cabin" l.b. Nice crisp <br/>
day with new snow on the ground. Very nice hand carved stamp. The 12 <br/>
y.o used her new personal stamp I carved for her for X-mas for the <br/>
first time. Her trail name is now "Sunburst":)This was also our first <br/>
winter letterboxing foray. Looking forward to N.E. gathering in Feb. <br/>
Safe trails to all!<br/>

We started Letterboxing on 8/29/2003 and fell in love with it. Now we are hooked.<br/>
