The more expensive logbooks from art supply stores really hold up well during <br/>

(I use a Moleskine that fits perfectly in my back pocket), but that will <br/>
hold up to travel as a sketchbook/journal. I tend to be the kind of person <br/>
who can always manage to drop something into a puddle when it's clear and <br/>
sunny. :) <br/>

I'm glad you found your logbook. <br/>
