hunt was so much fun!!  We got to see old friends, and meet some new <br/>
ones.  All in all, a great day.  Then we got home and labeled our <br/>
books, counted up our stamps, and lo and behold, we found our 1000th <br/>
box today:-)  That's a number we thought we'd never see.  Thanks to <br/>
all who make this hobby so great, and thanks to MammaFox and Bald <br/>
Eagle for a great gather!<br/>

before he *finally* went to sleep:-(</div>
