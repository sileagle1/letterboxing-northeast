gathering!<br/>
<br/>
I got the chance to provide a little assistance today to their <br/>
efforts and I must say this is gonna be fun rain or shine!~!!!<br/>
<br/>
I am not gonna get into any surprises that I may have come across <br/>
but suffice it to say  the stamps I did get to "see" are <br/>
awesome.....!<br/>
<br/>
I cant say enough about Hattie and Nautilus and their crazy passion <br/>
(LOVE IT) to design, coordinate and plant boxes for this....<br/>
<br/>
Anyone considering bring a picnic lunch , please reconsider and <br/>
enjoy a wonderfully cooked lunch at Hattie's.!!! And this is one <br/>
kokopellian who loves the wonderful selection of desserts!<br/>
<br/>
If you know of anyone considering attending , convince 'em!<br/>
and if you know some local boxers who are new and perhaps never been<br/>
recruit 'em.....<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing everyone &amp; Iam gonna go send some invites <br/>
to people right now :)<br/>
<br/>
