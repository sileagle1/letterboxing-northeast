museum is a work in progress with some of the friendliest, most helpful <br/>
volunteers. We went for the boxes, but ended up staying for about two <br/>
hours and learning A LOT about the railroad's history. We thoroughly <br/>
enjoyed this outing. If you get at chance, go out and get these. You <br/>
won't be disappointed.<br/>
