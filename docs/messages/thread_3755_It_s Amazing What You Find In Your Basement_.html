I decided to organize my letterboxing box equipment in the basement <br/>
that hasn't been used since we moved to Wallingford in July of 2006. I <br/>
found so many things. I have tons of stamps (Mickey Mouse, Looney <br/>
Tunes, Sponge Bob, El Diablo, etc.)that I have carved and never <br/>
planted. I found a HitchHiker that was given to me at the Trail Day <br/>
Gathering in 2005 that I will put in the Hostel in Meriden later this <br/>
week. And ... TWO POSTAL LETTERBOXES! I am so embarassed!!! :(<br/>
<br/>
I found BuzzBee and Tiger's "Snail In The Mail" postal box and <br/>
Uneksia's "!@#$%" postal box. If those two letterboxers would email me <br/>
with instructions I will do whatever they want with these boxes. I <br/>
continue them on their way or send them back to the originator. Just <br/>
let me know.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you all are doing well.<br/>
Safe Letterboxing!<br/>

It's Amazing What You Find In Your Basement!<br/>
I decided to organize my letterboxing box equipment in the basement<br/>
that hasn't been used since we moved to Wallingford in July of 2006. I<br/>
found so many things. I have tons of stamps (Mickey Mouse, Looney<br/>
Tunes, Sponge Bob, El Diablo, etc.)that I have carved and never<br/>
planted. I found a HitchHiker that was given to me at the Trail Day<br/>
Gathering in 2005 that I will put in the Hostel in Meriden later this<br/>
week. And ... TWO POSTAL LETTERBOXES! I am so embarassed!!! :(<br/>
<br/>
I found BuzzBee and Tiger's "Snail In The Mail" postal box and<br/>
Uneksia's "!@#$%" postal box. If those two letterboxers would email me<br/>
with instructions I will do whatever they want with these boxes. I<br/>
continue them on their way or send them back to the originator. Just<br/>
let me know.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you all are doing well.<br/>
