Well.  I had a GREAT time, and as anyone in attendance can attest <br/>
to, Krusty Krab enjoyed herself just a little, too.  Thanks to Music <br/>
Woman for the wonderful leadership. Thanks to Jude for posting the <br/>
group photo of the Winter Drive 2 Gang on the LBNE website.  Thanks <br/>
to Donutz for being Music Woman's second in command and helping out <br/>
immensely with the stamping.  Thanks to Flutterby for opening her <br/>
home to everybody for warmth, snax and a well needed break. Thanks <br/>
to Queen Bee for coming out on a Sunday evening to help find the <br/>
last box of the day for many in attendance.  Thank you to everyone <br/>
who made the event special, for me and my family (especially Krusty <br/>
Krab and Baby Liam).  Thanks to MayEve for keeping me in the loop <br/>
with all you super people. What a great, great time.  We can't wait <br/>
until the next one!!!  ---Wild Rover</div>
