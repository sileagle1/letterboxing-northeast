  I read or heard somewhere that sometimes when placing a letterbox the <br/>
  placer will enclose a little surprise for the first finder to take.  <br/>
  What kinds of things might they be?  I'd like to do that and even <br/>

<br/>
I have a hard time with the search function.  It takes so long to go back too far.  Maybe you know a better way than me or you could just keep clicking "previous" until you get to early March, then type "first time finds" in the "search archive"  box.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps, Fisher  <br/>
