years before we moved to California 3 years ago.  It was just AFTER we <br/>
got to the left coast that we discovered letterboxing.  Finally, we get <br/>
to spend a week in Ogunquit, Maine in August and plan to spend most of <br/>
the time boxing (and eating Lobster.)<br/>
<br/>
Our computer has been very busy sorting and printing clues.  In the <br/>
next several months we will be reading this group to learn more about <br/>
letterboxing in the great northeast.  Thanks for all the hard work you <br/>
have contributed to this hobby.  We look forward to finding some of <br/>
your boxes, and leaving a few of ours for you to find.<br/>
