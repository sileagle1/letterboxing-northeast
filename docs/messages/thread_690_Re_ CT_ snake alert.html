respectful.  After all, we are encroaching on their territory.  <br/>
Snakes are not agressive. They will escape as quickly as they can, if <br/>
surprised in their natural habitat. This desire to escape applies to <br/>
the huge but harmless black snake (racer)referred to in <br/>
Sunshine/Swamp Yankee's post  as well as the 2 types of poisonous <br/>
snakes that live in CT. (Copperhead and Timber Rattlesnake) They are <br/>
easily identified by the diamond shape of their heads. And they will <br/>
not strike unless cornered.<br/>
