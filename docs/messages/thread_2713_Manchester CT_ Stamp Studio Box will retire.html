                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1077752956">Thanks for the info.  It's such a shame that the store is going out of business.  They had some great things that you can't find in Michael's and the larger chains.  There is another store in Cromwell that is going out of business as well - can't remember name - something like Simply Stamps.  She said she just can't compete.  Everything was 30% off last week and she still has a pretty good inventory.  Check it out!<br/>
<br/>
  Enjoy!<br/>
