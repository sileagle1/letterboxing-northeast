I've gotten a few messages from people about what I was up to since I <br/>
blow my knee out last summer white water tubbing with my scouts. They <br/>
hadn't heard from me lately. Well sitting around for two months <br/>
nursing my knee, a friend and I came up with a plan to open an outdoor <br/>
retail store in Cumberland, RI. Our opening date is Aug. 19th and we <br/>
hope to have a letterbox in the store by the beginning of Sept. <br/>
(Having the stamp made) So with this venture I haven't had much time <br/>
to letterbox. If your out letterboxing this weekend in our area, <br/>
please stop by and we can exchange stamps till the store stamp comes <br/>
in. We're located on the Blackstone River and Bike Path at 2 Mendon <br/>
Road, Cumberland, RI<br/>
