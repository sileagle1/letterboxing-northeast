week while looking to plant. sorry for the crypticness here but this box is<br/>
a puzzlement. it is either orphaned or a wom. if it is a wom i do not wish<br/>
to give anything away. i am thinking it could possibly be orphaned and if it<br/>
is would be willing to adopt it. if it is a wom then it would be nice to<br/>
know who i can credit it to. i have researched the names of the planter and<br/>
have come up with nothing. if any thing sounds familiar please contact me. <br/>

southern new hampshire<br/>

no finders<br/>
easy walk<br/>
involves feathers<br/>
