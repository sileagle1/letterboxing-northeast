                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1287132356">While enjoying a warm brewed beverage late one night in an idyllic small <br/>
town far - but not too far - from her usual domain, a certain Sprite <br/>
wondered aloud to a certain resident of said idyllic (gorge-ous, even) <br/>
small town how long a specific sort of foreign object secreted inside any <br/>
one of the multiple locations of a certain well-known regional purveyor of <br/>
foodstuffs and sundries might successfully avoid detection.<br/>
<br/>
The local resident took the Sprite's query as a challenge to all who <br/>
frequent said establishment and has set in place the first three entries in <br/>
what should become a disheartening (at least to those of the janitorial <br/>
persuasion) plethora of attempts to claim the honor of surviving intact the <br/>
lengthiest period of time before being lost, retrieved, or (gasp!) <br/>
confiscated.<br/>
<br/>
The rules are simple. Identify the establishment. It is said that Fortune <br/>
smiles upon it, at least this particular year. If you are one of the lucky <br/>
ones with access to this haven of practically anything that might be <br/>
desired by ravenous mortals, create your own response to the Sprite's <br/>
challenge by the Ides of May. Be discreet in what you choose to leave <br/>
behind, and where. Wait, and then wait some more. To the victor comes great <br/>
spoils.<br/>
