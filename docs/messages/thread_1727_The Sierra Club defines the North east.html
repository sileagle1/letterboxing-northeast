<br/>
I was flipping through my AMC magazine last night and came across an <br/>
article on old growth forests in the north east.  The article was <br/>
written from a Sierra Club book called the Guide to Ancient Forests <br/>
in the Northeast.  Now you all may be asking, what do ancient forests <br/>
have to do with letterboxing ...  and the answer is really nothing.  <br/>
What surprised me was the definition of the north eastern US that <br/>
both the AMC and Sierra Club used. In addition to the 6 New England <br/>
states, New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey were all considered in <br/>
the north east.  This did surprise me.<br/>
<br/>
I kind of missed all the voting and discussion that this group had on <br/>
what states should be included in LbNE. Heck, until this all came up, <br/>
I was so out of it I thought LbNE stood for Letterboxing New England! <br/>
(I really need to pay better attention.)  Anyway, we should have just <br/>
asked the Sierra Club for the answer and saved time LOL.<br/>

Please don't take me seriously.)</div>
