I hope everyone had a good time. I'm sorry I missed it. Life got in the way. Grrrr!!! :) <br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows the answer to my personal traveler and would like a copy of the image....email me with your answer and I will mail you a copy of the image. Is that cheating? I don't think I've ever met a letterboxer on the trail and I really wanted to share this stamp image with others! <br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing!<br/>
Peppermint Patti :)<br/>
