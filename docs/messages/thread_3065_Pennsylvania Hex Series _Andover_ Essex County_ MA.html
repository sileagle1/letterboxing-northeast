If you do go get these boxes, you might want to bring an dated index <br/>
card with your stamp on it to leave in the first box. Definately bring <br/>
bug spray and the clues to these and other boxes. You can easily make a <br/>
day of boxing in Andover :)<br/>

Plus Choi's Quilt Codes are in the same general area, so this is definitely a must do! It's <br/>
