with me.  Took advantage of a couple of great days and went out to<br/>
see what we could find in the snow.  Headed out to Lebanon since we<br/>
won't be able to go on the coming Winter Driveby and picked up<br/>
several of those. Snow on rocks makes an interesting challenge. We<br/>
will certainly return for more one day. Today, we hunted down the new<br/>
ones in Simsbury placed by sea-cret and were first finders of all<br/>
four.  You had better be in pretty good shape to get to a couple of<br/>
them! It was a great day to be out.<br/>
