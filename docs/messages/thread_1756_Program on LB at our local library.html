Library tomorrow night at 7:00 p.m.  Late last year we worked with one of  the <br/>
librarians to plant a box in the library and got her intrigued so she asked  us <br/>
to do the program.<br/>
<br/>
We're going to talk a little about the history of LBing, what you need to  <br/>
get started, talk about etiquette, how to use a compass, and how to access  <br/>
clues on the computer.  Kristen, the librarian, carves stamps for a hobby  so <br/>
she's going to do a demo.  If we have time, we'll do a "field trip" to  the <br/>
library's letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts on anything else that we should include?<br/>
