<br/>
I'm sure you've heard by now that the free yahoo GeoCities websites are all going to evaporate at the end of the year. More info on this is here: <br/>
&lt;<a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/geocities/geocities-05.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/geocities/geocities-05.html</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxers would hate to see these clues disappear. We have plenty of time to spread awareness of this coming problem to people who use Geocities and to help them find alternatives, but we could use the help of the regional letterboxing groups.<br/>
<br/>
If you know someone who uses Geocities for their clues, please try and contact them and let them know what is happening. They can send any quesitons about possible solutions to the webmasters at letterboxing.org<br/>
<br/>
Folks with only a few letterbox clues on geocities may want to cut and paste them into both letterboxing.org and atlasquest.com. Or they could move them to another ISP and keep their clues as html pages if they prefer. I think they could also start paying for Geocities and then they would keep their websites intact. If there is anything we can do to help with the process, please don't hesitate to ask.<br/>
<br/>
In a few weeks we hope to have a group of volunteers working to ferret out clues, contact box planters, and to facilitate adopting geocities boxes of inactive boxers. Hopefully we will be working both with letterboxing.org and with atlasquest.com on this project.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to bring bad news and extra work to your day, but happy letterboxing.<br/>
