We also give our thoughts, prayers and hugs to you both.  Although we've <br/>
never met on the trails, reading all the messages, we believe we became <br/>
to know Molly.  Our sympathies go out to you.  We know the love and bond <br/>

  I am so sorry.  Molly was a beautiful dog with the sweetest personality, and I smile to remember the times I met up with her at Gatherings or on the trails.  Although she may not walk the trails beside you now, she will still walk them with you in your hearts.  The Letterboxing community shares your loss.  <br/>
  In thought and Prayer, MayEve<br/>

I felt a pang of sadness when I read of your loss,<br/>
tonight.  We met Molly for the first time at our first<br/>
gathering and she was amoung the happy welcoming<br/>
memories that we have of that day.  Words are just not<br/>
appropriate at this moment but, please know that our<br/>
hearts go out to you at the loss of your dear friend. <br/>
We will remember her fondly.<br/>

I too want to chime in on the passing of Molly--never met her on the <br/>
trails but I too know how hard it is to lose a beloved member of the <br/>
family. Our woofers do become members of the family if we let them.  <br/>
L'sister is certainly part of ours. Blessings to you in your time of <br/>
grief.  Howling Wolf<br/>
