to hear you were in decent shape so far.  It sounded like our fall <br/>
rains hit you harder than these.  This storm seems to have hit a <br/>
much larger area.  Right where I am (Lakes Region, central NH) some <br/>
roads have been washed out but our immediate area has been spared <br/>
any major destruction.  My basement began to fill but I got the sump <br/>
pump going.  The water is below the dock and the dam across the lake <br/>
is holding.  Until last fall it never occurred to me it could let <br/>
go.  (Naive I guess) I guess we'll have to check the status of our <br/>
Covered Bridge Letterboxes when the waters recede.  Hopefully they <br/>
were replaced carefully and the boxes are holding up.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my prayers are with you and others who are being affected by <br/>
this mess. <br/>

Living where i am we have high water, but no real flooding<br/>
problems, Went hiking today at Smarts Brook on Rte 49. It was pouring<br/>
out, but if wait for sun- i may never get any exercise. The trail was<br/>
just like one big stream!!<br/>
  Im on the local FD, so we were called out to Andover and Bristol!!<br/>
Flooding also brought out the black flies!! Everyime today stoped to<br/>
take a picture of high water, black flies came after me!<br/>
