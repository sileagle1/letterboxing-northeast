Middlefield, CT today. Thanks to Hez, Mona and Grumpy, we had a nice <br/>
afternoon outside. I grew up not far from this park and have hiked <br/>
there many times and remarkably never did those two trails! <br/>
(Although I've driven down Laurel Grove a number of times! Mercy <br/>
High graduate!) It seems whenever I went I was headed for the falls! <br/>
So it was nice to see another area of the park. Boxes are in fine <br/>
condition! Thanks again! Can't wait to get back out and do the rest <br/>
at Wadsworth!<br/>
