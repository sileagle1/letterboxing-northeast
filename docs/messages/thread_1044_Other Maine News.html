<br/>
Sounds like the Maine gathering was a success (stings aside).  As <br/>
noted earlier, the Weathergleams were spoken for to the eastward <br/>
that day, attending a wedding, but improved upon their time away <br/>
with a little boxing.  Alive and well:<br/>
<br/>
The Early Bird (nota bene: this log is full; we stamped the inside <br/>
back cover),<br/>
Back Beach I,<br/>
Bass Harbor Vista,<br/>
One More Round,<br/>
Peacock's Pandora, and<br/>
a L'ovely series.<br/>
<br/>
Not found: Charlotte's View.<br/>
<br/>
Merciless time constraints,  driving rain and little legs kept us <br/>
from any serious attempt to orient ourselves expressly, much less to <br/>
vary the theme, sorely tempted though we were.  Our all too casual <br/>
investigations near beaches and firs in the clouds were predictably <br/>
unrewarded, and properly so.  However, there will be a next time.  <br/>
<br/>
And with far less bravado, probably a next time after that...<br/>
