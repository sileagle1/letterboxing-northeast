I took R there on Monday  to the Linwood Tree , and was shocked to see , no bush ,the tree gone -- and a new wall at right angles.  Boo Hoo , I was afraid to move any of the new stones to look for the box    I will take her back another day .<br/>
  while I have your attention ~~~ we went hiking today and found your~ You are My Pink Shine ~~ last people there was in November !  What a great hike . It is so nice that they were able to move the blue trail in there .  It is not even shown in my 'new'  East of the River CT Forest and Park map book. I had completed the Mattabesett Trail years ago , so it was fun to get on this new section that I had not hiked.  Now -- to just do the rest of it and see where it connects !p.s.  we were short on time , so our return to the car ~~ I took us out to a 'dirt' road and down the hill to Aitkens , so we walked most of the way back on the road.  R had a dentist appointment so it felt ok. to leave the trail and  very hard stream crossing  and take to the road / boy there was a lot of water to try to get over and across . <br/>
I saw that you and Gizz walked to and over the bridge for Hez and Grumpy's box at the Hall of Fame in Middletown .  I took one look at the river today and said NO WAY -- it was so high and rushing , if R or I had slipped . Good Bye ~~ so got out the map and drove to it !!!We had a good laugh at Hez saying to be careful with small children-- never a peep about OLD Ladies <br/>
we had a fun day , and thanks for giving us a nice hike .<br/>
