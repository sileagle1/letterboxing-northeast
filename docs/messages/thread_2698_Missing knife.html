                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-982530336">Just wanted to let everyone know that Grumpy and I were letterboxing <br/>
Friday and Saturday and I lost a brand new Gerber knife that Grump had <br/>
just gotten me.  I had it all of 6 hours.  If you folks would be kind <br/>
enough to keep an eye out for it for me I would really appreciate it.  <br/>
Of course it's now buried under 2 feet of snow, but maybe it will turn <br/>
up in the Spring.  It's an E-Z out, silver.  We went to do some of the <br/>
boxes in Glastonbury-My Favorite Winter Things, Nostalgia Series, Town <br/>
Line and Meshomasic State Forest-Seedling Series.  I didn't realize it <br/>
was missing until this morning when I was re-arranging my pack.  <br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>

All of the other boxes are far enough off trail so someone may not see it, if they are walking past on the Shenipsit.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I can find it for you in the spring!  (or when the snow thaws, whichever comes first ;-)<br/>
