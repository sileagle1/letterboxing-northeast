<br/>
Nautilus and Culex joined Phyto and Isosceles on a letterboxing frenzy<br/>
this past Sunday! We all enjoyed the new Portland boxes placed by CB<br/>
Painter and Merenwen! The Canine Letterboxes were grand fun as we<br/>
tried to stay moving while watching all the dogs running around!<br/>
<br/>
Phyto enjoyed the historic views of the Ferry Village mystery boxes<br/>
and the fun stamps also! We also took a swing by a Legerdemaine view<br/>
of a lighthouse somewhere along the coast that is doing just fine.<br/>
<br/>
Phyto managed to plant 11 of the 15 boxes in the Portland East End<br/>
microbox series. Look for this fun series of boxes coming soon!<br/>
<br/>
Finally, for those interested, Phyto and Nautilus are cooking up a<br/>
mini-Maine gathering for sometime in March. More details to come!</div>
