Boston, so that the shortest team member could garner a first finder<br/>
certificate for logbook.<br/>
<br/>
It was a beautiful afternoon, and this new box was in a lovely<br/>
out-of-the-way park. Following the clues, we wandered down the dirt<br/>
and then gravel paths, found the birch tree nearly in the river, and<br/>
discovered Beehives and Bumblebees. We took the box down the path<br/>
aways so we could open and stamp in at leisure far distant from the<br/>
hiding spot. The sun was bright, the river beautiful .. the older team<br/>
member was yearning for a nap.<br/>
<br/>
No first finder certificate, but a new hitchhiker being launched was<br/>
discovered. We will make sure this HH hops into another box this<br/>
weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Before racing home to beat the worst of the afternoon commuter<br/>
traffic, we spent an hour looking for Deep Brook and Dragonfly. Deep<br/>
Brook was just placed this weekend, and Dragonfly was just confirmed<br/>
as in place last weekend, so we were obviously just interpreting the<br/>
clues incorrectly.<br/>
<br/>
Lovely reservation, once you can find the sign at the entrance. Very<br/>
quiet under the pine trees, no one else there. Saw a woodpecker<br/>
hopping up a tree.<br/>
<br/>
Me: Look, there is a downy or hairy woodpecker.<br/>
Short One: (said with utter confidence) Must be a hairy woodpecker,<br/>
cos I don't see any down feathers.<br/>
