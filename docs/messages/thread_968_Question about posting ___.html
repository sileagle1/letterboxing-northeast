<br/>
I just redesigned the website I set up to track my and Anjabanja's <br/>
letterboxing experiences and statistics.  Instead of simply listing <br/>
the boxes we've found, I decided to write a short description of our <br/>
quest to find it and, where applicable, provide some useful <br/>
information about the places we travelled in the process.  <br/>
Essentially, this becomes a journal of our letterboxing adventures.<br/>
<br/>
I'm in the process of adding some commentary to some of the boxes for <br/>
which I had not previously written anything.  I also wanted to <br/>
include a couple of pictures with each entry.  No pictures of the <br/>
find or its location, of course, nor any pictures that would <br/>
compromise the integrity of the clues will be posted, but rather some <br/>
nice shots of the scenery to compliment our story.<br/>
<br/>
While it's nice for us to have and to look back on, I thought others <br/>
might be interested in hearing our tales as well.  I know some people <br/>
here post their stories and I was thinking of doing the same (or at <br/>
least providing the link to the site where you can read them).  As I <br/>
said, they are all pretty short.<br/>
<br/>
But, because this is not a forum but an e-mail list, I thought I'd <br/>
ask the group's opinion and/or permission first.  I don't receive e-<br/>
mail from these groups, but rather check the website for new <br/>
messages, but I could appreciate that people may not enjoy me <br/>
populating their e-mail boxes with the stories of my finds.<br/>
<br/>
So, how about it?<br/>
<br/>
As an example take a look here:<br/>

may be just enough of a hint to clue [ no pun intended ] someone in <br/>
on where the mystery is.  Example - If you see I spent all day at <br/>

<br/>
Someone else e-mailed me with a similar suggestion regarding mystery <br/>
boxes ... a suggestion I'll incorporate into the website.  Your point <br/>
is certainly valid -- a little deduction will help solve the mystery  <br/>
of the location, wouldn't it?  Fortunately the one mystery box listed <br/>
is unique in that respect ... even listed as it is provides no real <br/>
information about how to find it.  Those who have found this box know <br/>
what I mean!<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, I'll set up an additional table to track mystery boxes <br/>
separate from the main list (similar to what I've done for personal <br/>
travelers).  I suppose I'll have to consider the same question if we <br/>
find bonus boxes as well.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; find bonus boxes as well.<br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Exactly!  This all kind of goes back to a large part of the debate on <br/>
the LBNA list regarding the database. I'm making a big assumption <br/>
CPAScott that you were not a letterboxer prior to that huge <br/>
debate,mess,flame,thingamadgiggy.  Essentially there was an idea to <br/>
make a database in that section of letterbox-usa to track last visits <br/>
and overall box status. <br/>
<br/>
A lot of folks said it took the mystery out of finding boxes. A lot <br/>
had Phyto's opinion about not wanting to see any more info about the <br/>
clues than the placer had given. Several of us requested that our <br/>
clues not be commented on too. This wound up becoming a huge debate <br/>
and caused many hurt feelings to the point that someone even <br/>
vandalised the database and deleted a lot of stuff. <br/>
<br/>
That backround being given, I think your idea of keeping a log and <br/>
journal on your website is perfectly fine. You will likely not see us <br/>
keeping that same log on our site for a few reasons: 1) We're lazy <br/>
and its not that important to us currently. 2) Don't want to risk <br/>
accidentally spoiling it 3) We're not big into writing. Most of the <br/>
clue writing we do is hard enough, you'll see my clues as technically <br/>
correct but I'm not at all gifted as a creative writer (i.e. <br/>
describing a hike on paper).   <br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna clip this short as I have no idea where these ramblings are <br/>
going (case in point re: my creative writing skills).<br/>
