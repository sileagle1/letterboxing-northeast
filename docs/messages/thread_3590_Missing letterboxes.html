have found over 850 letterboxes found but the past few years we have <br/>
been geocaching. The only reason I can think of that letterboxes have <br/>
been targeted instead of geocaches (after doing both hobbies)is that <br/>
letterboxes can be found by following the directions for the box. To <br/>
find a geocache, the person doing this would have to invest at least <br/>
$100 to buy a GPS &amp; learn how to read it. It probably is too much <br/>
trouble to go through. It's only a thought-hopefully whomever is doing <br/>
this will get tired of it quickly &amp; let everyone enjoy a very enjoyable <br/>
hobby-both letterboxing &amp; geocaching!</div>
