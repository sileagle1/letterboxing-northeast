have been scrapbooking my letterboxing adventures for a little while. <br/>
Using photos and stamp images along with bits of clues and fun <br/>
enhancements I create some neat memories. I just did a page of the <br/>
mini gather at Eagleville using some of the group photo the sit and <br/>
relax stamp and some of the HH images. If you would like to try  <br/>
scrapbooking some of your  images reply to me off list. I will have <br/>
a  class on Friday January 16  from 7-9. You would bring a couple <br/>
pictures and also some images from a particular  hike.  I would have <br/>
all the materials to do a page and of course - an event stamp! If you <br/>
are interested it should be a fun night. reply to:  <br/>
