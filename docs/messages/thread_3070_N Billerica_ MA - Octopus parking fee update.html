                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1581717023">I got an email that someone was asked for $3.00 to park there.  Walked <br/>
over &amp; no one was collecting money, but someone verifed that there is <br/>
now a "fee". <br/>
<br/>
If you are visiting the free waterpark with kids, the $3 is a good <br/>
deal.  Lousey deal if you just want to walk in the park.<br/>
<br/>
If you just want to do the Octopus letterboxes, drive west from the <br/>
entrance &amp; pull into a roadside pulloff &amp; walk into the park - free.  <br/>
My town manages this park &amp; they are messed up.<br/>
<br/>
enjoy,<br/>
