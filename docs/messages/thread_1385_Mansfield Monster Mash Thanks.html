                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1057838670">What an amazing group of letterboxers and there were a lot of you!! At this point, we really don't know the final number that attended but a rough estimate based on the entries in the event book, were about 350 letterboxers and some of those were family stamps. Thank you all for attending and making this such a monstrous event!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the first group of people we need to thank are the Monster Makers. Without them this event would not have happened. This was truly a letterboxers community joint effort. <br/>
<br/>
We had a lot of help with this event and would like to publicly extend our thanks and appreciation for all that they and everyone did: Catlover/Gardener/Teacher for handling the numerous RSVP emails and keeping us on track with the food and donations items; Pinetree and Wolfy for bringing extra tables and chairs, the Bullhorn (which we really did need), manning the raffle tables, selling the raffle tickets and so many other things that it's hard to name them all, PE Sneakers for helping with the raffle tables, Joe G &amp; Paul of the MapLines for their tremendous help with the parking situation, Brenda of Mom-of-3 for all her assistance,Moma Fox and Bald Eagle for bringing all the cooking supplies. Linda the Hot Dog Lady, Bald Eagle and Dave The Letterboxing Ham for all the cooking, The Columbian Bugs, Nannybell, Joanne and a slew of others who helped everywhere it was needed. As you can see, we had an awful lot of help and apologize if we missed publicly thanking individuals. Everyone was very generous with the raffle donations and the food everyone brought was terrific. No one went away hungry, or least we hope they didn't.<br/>
<br/>
We had some raffle items that were not claimed and we will be contacting those people. We also have a few items left behind and as soon as we can sort through everything, we'll post what we have.<br/>
<br/>
We will soon be posting pictures and if anyone took any pictures and could email them to me, I'd be happy to include them as well.<br/>
<br/>
On behalf of the hosts, Chuck and Molly, Chickabirdie, The NeeDeeps and Teach &amp; Preach, our most sincere appreciation and thanks to everyone!! Happy Monster Hunting....Chuck and Molly<br/>

Maplines thank you for bringing that beautiful grandbaby. The sharing was so great.  Hugh we loved your outlook on having daughters and enjoyed the laugh. Thank you all for a wonderful day.<br/>
