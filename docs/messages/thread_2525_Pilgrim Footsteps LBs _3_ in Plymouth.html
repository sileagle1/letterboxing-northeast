<br/>
Last November we placed a series of 3 LBs at the waterfront in Plymouth <br/>
(near Plymouth Rock).  We are heading there today to re-place these <br/>
boxes for November 2005.  We will post the clues this evening.  All the <br/>
stamps are the same (hand-carved), but locations may be different so <br/>
the old clues have been deleted and the new clues will be available <br/>
tonight.  Last year, the Forefather's LB went missing so Amy recarved <br/>
that stamp. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all that found these boxes last year and for those that <br/>
didn't...here is your chance!  They will be gone come December 1st!!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Fall,<br/>
Amy &amp; Jay</div>
