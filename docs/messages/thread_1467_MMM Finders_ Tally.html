  I am curious about how many people will end up finding the entire <br/>
series, and just how many boxes people end up with if not finding <br/>
every one. The letterbox senders must be VERY curious!!<br/>
  So, the week on Nov. 1st, please e-mail me with your final tallies. <br/>
I'll post the results on the talklist and also submit the numbers to <br/>
Chuck for his webpage. It'll be a basic count, such as so-and-so many <br/>
people found them all, so-and-so many people found 75 to 100. Well, <br/>
you get the point. <br/>
  May The Force be with you.<br/>

MMM "found" count so far (loving this glorious fall weather though)</div>
