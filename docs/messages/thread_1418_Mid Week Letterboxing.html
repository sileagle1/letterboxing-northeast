Mansfield we found:<br/>

King Kong<br/>
Frankenstein<br/>
Bride of Frankenstein<br/>
Legend of Sleepy Hollow<br/>
Alein<br/>
Wild Thing #1<br/>
Wild Thing #2<br/>
Max<br/>
Attack of the 50 Foot Woman<br/>
Mummy Dearest<br/>

<br/>
While we were at Monsters of Cemetery Road we bumped into Chuck,<br/>
Molly, Chickabirdie, Martini Man and Wisconsin Hiker.  They informed<br/>
us of an unpublished box in that area.  Bringing our total of finds<br/>
yesterday to 11, but does anyone know the information on that<br/>
unpublished box?  If was 7pm so it was really dark, and in our hurry<br/>
we forgot to write down what it was called.  Thanks<br/>
