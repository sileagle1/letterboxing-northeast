having a lot of work at home, with finding a new job, with keeping the <br/>

I will still participate in the Live and Breathe gather in Oregon next <br/>
month, but that will be my last gathering.  Good luck to all of you and <br/>
I hope to see you around soon.  Perhaps I'll have a chance to come back <br/>

You are so much a part of letterboxing history and how it has developed in CT. I'm sure there are many many stories and memories of adventures with you or going to your boxes by so many people. The hobby won't be quite the same without you. You will be missed very much. I hope that someday we see you back letterboxing again. Please keep in touch. Your friends....Chuck, Chickabirdie and Amy<br/>

I certainly never believe in 'good-bye', and ours is a small area, so I do expect to see you along and again - maybe at a fair or some such.  And even the most sedentary husband has taken up the walking stick when his lady gets the itch to hike.  We shall see.  Meanwhile, I hope the projects get happily done and you get to settle into a nice marital nest soon!<br/>

  You have touched so many people in our letterboxing community and I am sure many are thinking with heavy hearts just like you - at the thought of loosing such an enthusiastic letterboxer  and fun person .  But , I see that you say you are just retiring from 'traditional ' letterboxing . We all know that your traditional letterboxing was fast and furious !!  I remember one year when we might have broken records for the number of boxes recorded as our finds.  It was so much fun and most other issues were put aside as we boxed away .  Now that your life has grown to include a husband and building a new house, etc, it is only natural that those things take on the important spot . That does not mean other pleasures need to lost . Please consider the joy , of just a walk in a park , soaking up the healing magic of the woods and OOPS maybe a letterbox might be along the way !!!  I am always there for that . <br/>

I've been doing a lot of thinking about this hobby lately. I've been <br/>
having a lot of work at home, with finding a new job, with keeping the <br/>

being a newlywed. I write this with a heavy heart that I will no <br/>

wonderful friends along the way, many of whom I hope will continue to <br/>
include me in non-letterboxing activities in the future (setback <br/>
anyone????? ;-). I'm just finding it hard to juggle Peter, the house, <br/>
and the job hunt.<br/>
<br/>
I will still participate in the Live and Breathe gather in Oregon next <br/>
month, but that will be my last gathering. Good luck to all of you and <br/>
I hope to see you around soon. Perhaps I'll have a chance to come back <br/>
to boxing in a few years when my husband approves, and when my life <br/>
calms down somewhat.<br/>

<br/>
You can remove yourself from letterboxing to get on with your life and return any time you wish to box as much or as little as you wish. That's an inherent part of the hobby. You always have friends here and there will always be people who remember you and your (many) contributions. Other boxers will volunteer to watch over your boxes or adopt them. (I prefer to be more of the watch-over than take-over type, and will gladly over up Team Safari to go check on and maintain any traditional boxes you leave in RI. We like missions.)   <br/>
<br/>
So let go and jump into married life and your future! Take the energy, enthusiasm, creativity, and devotion you've had for 'boxing and use it for other things. Take your hiatus with love and blessings! Thanks for all you've done. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes always,<br/>
Mary<br/>

       I do remember the first gather i went to in ct. You were so so kind and happy to meet everyone ! 2005 was our first year and meeting you was a plus .You can take the person out of letter boxing ,but letter boxing is in your heart. Who knows what tomorrow will bring ? I do hope that down the road things change and you jump right in .See you in oregon .<br/>

It has always been great to have you in the letterboxing group.  Your <br/>
classes and boxes are a great part of the scene here in Connecticut.  <br/>
But family and work do have to come first.<br/>
<br/>
Don't call it retiring completely.  Just say you are taking a break.  <br/>
Yes, husbands can be brought out into the woods and they can learn to <br/>
enjoy themselves.  When your life changes are settled down, there are <br/>
lots of friends and adventures waiting for you here.  You will get <br/>
the letterboxing urge again, and be back as much as will fit in your <br/>
new life.<br/>
<br/>
Until then I will miss you.<br/>

I am very sad to hear about your retirement from letterboxing. Every time I<br/>
go out boxing, I see your stamp and was very excited to meet you (finally)<br/>
at the Glastonbury, CT gathering a couple of years ago. I remember how lucky<br/>
you were when you won 2 bottles of wine there! ;-) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You will be missed by everyone - even those of us who are not always so<br/>
vocal. Best of luck with your other projects. I hope that you can return to<br/>
boxing one day soon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
