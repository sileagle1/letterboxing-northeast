letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
We got 2 before calling it a day.<br/>
<br/>
Monson Village letterbox in Milford, NH was a bit of a challenge, <br/>
but we found it at last. Well hidden, but the stamp pad was missing. <br/>
Sorry, we didn't have one in our bag to replace it with.<br/>
<br/>
We also got the Purgatory Falls box Everything fine there!)I'd <br/>
recommend going in the spring or earlier in the summer as the Falls <br/>
are really much nicer then. We've hiked that area before, it's <br/>
really worth spending some time.<br/>
<br/>
Just spent the evening carving a stamp for a planned letterbox in <br/>
Hollis, NH. Will place it soon and let you all know.<br/>
