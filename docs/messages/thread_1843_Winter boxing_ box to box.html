bring some copies of it tomorrow.  :)<br/>
<br/>
From Bartlett Brook, we're going to Pioneers in Lebanon.  Turn left onto <br/>
Goshen Hill Road, and right onto route 16 north.  The Exeter Cemetery is near this <br/>
intersection (Pioneers in Lebanon).<br/>
<br/>
After Pioneers in Lebanon, go east onto route 207.  Keep an eye out on the <br/>
left for the "Hidden Cemetery" which is actually called Center Cemetery.  This <br/>
is where we will find the Hidden Cemetery series and Baby D Turns 2.<br/>
<br/>
Following this box, we'll go back on 207 West and turn left into the parking <br/>
lot ofr Lebanon High School.  We'll cross the street on foot to go to Blue <br/>
Goose in the Town Pound.  (Just trust me on this order.)<br/>
<br/>
Following that, we'll get back into our cars and go out onto 207 west and <br/>
then turn right onto Mack Road, and pull into the soccer field parking lot.  This <br/>
is the location for Lebanon Lions.<br/>
<br/>
We'll get back onto Mack Road and keep going in the direction we were headed <br/>
in, and then turn right onto Barker Road.  At the intersection wth 207, we'll <br/>
take a left and head east.  When we see the sign for the French Soldier's <br/>
grave we'll park and do Baby D Turns 1.<br/>
<br/>
From here, we'll continue on 207 east and turn right when we get to the <br/>
center of town.  We'll go right onto West Town Street and enter the Lebanon Green <br/>
Market and get Tymfurkoffi.<br/>
<br/>
From here, Flutterby can direct us to the best parking area for the boxes on <br/>
the Green (Lebanon Loop 1, Red Brick Meeting House, A Night on Lebanon Green), <br/>
since she's a local and knows where to park there if church is in session.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Following the boxes on the Green, we'll head down West Town Street and join <br/>
up with Trumbull Road.   Turn right onto Goshen Hill Road. Pull into the last <br/>
driveway of the Fire/Safety Complex and park on the right side of the building. <br/>
 This is where we'll find Local Heroes.<br/>
<br/>
After this, we'll go back up Trumbull Road toward the center of town and make <br/>
a right onto Exeter Road.  We'll pull into Lebanon Elementary on the right <br/>
and do My First Love.  <br/>
<br/>
Then we'll get back onto Exeter Road and go to the bottom of the hill and <br/>
park in front of the Trumbull Cemetery on the left.  This is the parking spot for <br/>
both Lebanon Loop 2 and Pot O' Gold.<br/>
<br/>
After these boxes we'll head in the same direction on Exeter Road and make a <br/>
left onto Kick Hill Road.  At the stop sign, go straight at the intersection <br/>
of Babcock Hill Road. Take the next left onto Chappel Road, and a quick right <br/>
onto Bogg Lane (about 1.3 miles from the cemetery). Less than 1/10th of a mile <br/>
on Bogg Lane, pull over on the left in between a barbed wire fence and a large <br/>
tree.  Pull out your Lebanon Loop clues for box #3!<br/>
<br/>
Now Head back off Bogg Lane the way you came and take a right onto Chappel <br/>
Road. Follow it to the end. Take a right onto 289. Follow for 2.4 miles. After <br/>
you pass the small plaza on the left, take the next left onto Village Hill <br/>
Road.  Go down a half mile on Village Hill Road. The park is on the right, and <br/>
it’s pretty obscure if you’re not looking for it. If you reach Krause Road on the <br/>
left, you’ve gone too far! Turn around and go back, the park is easier to <br/>
spot coming from this direction.   This park is the location of Lebanon Loop #4 <br/>
and Bear Tracks.<br/>
<br/>
Following this, we'll keep headin gnorth on Village Hill Road.  Turn left <br/>
onto Cook Hill Road. Scovell Cemetery will be on your right.  This is where we'll <br/>
look for the Castle of Scovell.<br/>
<br/>
Now we'll head to our final destination.  Continue on Cook Hill Road until <br/>
the intersection with Route 87.  Take 87 south (or is it east?), and on the left <br/>
will be Liberty Hill Cemetery.  This is the location of Gray of Liberty Hill.<br/>
<br/>
And I believe that will do it!  I'm pretty optimistic that we'll be able to <br/>
hit most, if not all, of these.  It's a short way from box to box, since <br/>
they're all in the same town, and they're all drive-bys. <br/>
<br/>
Special thanks to Flutterby.  :)  And to Queen B, since I cut and pasted some <br/>
of her driving directions off her clues.  :)<br/>
<br/>
See you tomorrow at 9!<br/>
