<br/>
<br/>
The Treasures of Yarmouth Scavenger Hunt  is perfect <br/>
for singles, friends, couples, the whole family! Letter Boxers, too! This event <br/>
is not a race; it offers plenty of time for participants to explore and enjoy <br/>
the town at their own pace. Hunters will start by picking up a booklet and map <br/>
at the Cultural Center of Cape Cod between 10am and noon and will then explore <br/>
Yarmouth’s cultural, natural, and commercial gems before concluding at the <br/>
Cultural Center no sooner than 4:30pm for refreshments, prizes, entertainment, <br/>
and more. Locations on the Hunt will include: Packet Landing on the Bass River, <br/>
Judah Baker Windmill, Bass River (aka Smuggler’s) Beach, Parker’s River Beach, <br/>
Bayberry Hills Golf Course, Gray’s Beach/Bass Hole, Taylor-Bray Farm, Flax Pond <br/>
Recreation Area, The Cobbler Shop and Kelley Chapel, The Weeping Beech Tree, The <br/>
Bangs Hallet House, The New Church, The Edward Gorey House, ZooQuarium, Bass <br/>
River Sports World, and The Cultural Center of Cape Cod. At each location, <br/>
hunters will get their booklets stamped. Those participating at the Advanced <br/>
Level will be asked to answer questions at each stop. Every properly completed <br/>
booklet will become an eligible entry for valuable prizes, including a grand <br/>
prize for the winner at the Advanced Level. prizes will include a weekend stay <br/>
at a Red Jacket Resort, meals at fine Yarmouth establishments, and works of art. <br/>
Funded in part by a grant from the Town of Yarmouth Tourism Revenue Preservation Fund. For <br/>
tickets, visit the Center or call 508-394-7100. For more information, visit <br/>
