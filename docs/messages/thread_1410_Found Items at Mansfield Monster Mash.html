<br/>
There were only a few items left behind following the gathering. After sorting through everything, here is the list:<br/>
<br/>
A pair of sunglasses<br/>
White water bottle with blue swirl<br/>
Wicker basket with 2 towels<br/>
Small cooler with ice pack &amp; plastic bowls<br/>
<br/>
If any of these items are yours, please contact me off list so we can make arrangements to get them back to you.<br/>
<br/>
A note to Southern Light of The End Gang...sorry to say that a little yellow basket was not among the items found. I hope someone has already contacted you about finding it.<br/>
<br/>
Chuck and Molly<br/>
