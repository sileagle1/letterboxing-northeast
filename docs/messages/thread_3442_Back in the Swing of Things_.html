happened.  Needless to say, now things are different and I want to get <br/>
back into it. My boyfriend and I just got an RV, so I'm going to try <br/>
to get him into letterboxing too. (Wish me luck, hehe). Anyway, does <br/>
anyone know any campgrounds (that accomodate with RV/Camper hook-ups) <br/>
that have letterboxes on the grounds? I know a lot of these type <br/>
campgrounds are private, but nevertheless.... Just curious. <br/>
<br/>
We're planning on going to Danforth Bay in Freedom, NH on May 19-20. <br/>
There are not any boxes in there, are there? If not, we might ask <br/>
permission to place one.</div>
