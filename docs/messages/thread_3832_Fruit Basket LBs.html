                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1179683689">I checked Fruit Basket today and had to make a few changes in the<br/>
clues since my clues were old and some non-existent.  All 5 boxes in<br/>
the series are alive and well.  The trail between the 2nd box and the<br/>
road is very overgrown but you can get through.  The 3rd box appeared<br/>
to be missing but we found it beside the trail a little farther on. <br/>
Looks like some hiker saw it (maybe it wasn't concealed well), looked<br/>
at it and threw it into the bushes.  I feel fortunate to have found<br/>
it.  This box has been hidden in a new location.  Everything else seem<br/>
to be in good shape. Be sure to check the revised clues before hunting<br/>
for these.<br/>
This is one of my earliest series and I'm delighted that they have<br/>
survived so well.  Thanks to all finders for careful re-concealing.<br/>
