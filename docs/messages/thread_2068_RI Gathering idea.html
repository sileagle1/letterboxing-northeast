  Hey everyone. Now that the nice weather has returned, and I'm letterboxing <br/>
  nearly every day, I think a GATHERING is in order!!!<br/>
<br/>
  I'm located in Northwest Rhode Island. I would love to host some kind of get <br/>
  together in a local park. I have a few in mind where renting a site is very <br/>
  affordable. <br/>
<br/>
  I'd like to see a show of hands of anyone that would attend a Rhode Island <br/>

  Hey everyone. Now that the nice weather has returned, and I'm letterboxing <br/>
  nearly every day, I think a GATHERING is in order!!!<br/>
<br/>
  I'm located in Northwest Rhode Island. I would love to host some kind of get <br/>

  affordable. <br/>
<br/>
  I'd like to see a show of hands of anyone that would attend a Rhode Island <br/>
