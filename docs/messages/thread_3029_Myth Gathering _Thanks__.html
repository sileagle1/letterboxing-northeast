trip... WOW... What a fantastically amazing - incredibly... !awesome! <br/>
gathering!<br/>
<br/>
We arrived at the park first, were a little worried, lol... we didn't <br/>
know the area, didn't know where to camp out... it had poured down on <br/>
us, torrentially, on our way through New Hampshire (cars slowed down <br/>
in the 55/65 mile an hour zone to ... 30... and 25... with caution <br/>
lights flashing ... it was just miserable, and confidence <br/>
shaking...) .  Thank goodness we pulled the truck over right before <br/>
it slammed us. Absolutely take that to mean "right before it slammed <br/>
us"... we no sooner had taken a few drenchable items out of the back <br/>
of the truck before we drove down the road, literally, 30 seconds, <br/>
and the sky opened up like you wouldn't believe.<br/>
<br/>
We trudged on.... drove through 2 of these rainfalls, and just kept <br/>
on-a-cruisin... NOTHING was going to stop us from making this <br/>
weekend.  If we were going to be boxing in the rain?  We knew we <br/>
wouldn't be the only ones!  =:D  That's the great thing about die <br/>
hard boxers, lol, you just *know* you're not the only one doing <br/>
this "Crazy...what the heck am I doing? Am I Crazy? I *must* be <br/>
crazy!" letterboxing adventure - heck no.  =:D<br/>
<br/>
We weren't at the tent site more than 15 minutes when The Wildcats <br/>
showed up, and about 20 minutes after that SagaCorn.  We had a <br/>
wonderful pre-event camping night, and a great time boxing together.<br/>
<br/>
SapphireBerry and WoodSprite - you really outdid yourselves.  This <br/>
event was everything we imagined and about a hundred things more.  It <br/>
poured on Friday night, but we were all nice and cozy warm (and dry) <br/>
under a screen tent, we all had tarps to keep our tents bone dry... <br/>
it was an adventure for the books!  And the boxing day itself?  A <br/>
little rain in the morning?  Pffff, that was nothin'.  This event was <br/>
bigger (HUGER!) than the rain - without a doubt!<br/>
<br/>
The icing on the cake (besides the views from Mt. Olympus) was the <br/>
night boxing.  What  - a  - !RIOT!  I heard someone say, about the <br/>
night time boxing and the box hidden in the porta-potty, lol, "ohhhh <br/>
Ms.SapphireBerry, what a sense of humor you do have...." lol.. and I <br/>
laughed when I thought about SapphireBerry and WoodSprite hanging out <br/>
(for a VERY long time, lol) in the men's room Porta-Potty just <br/>
waiting for some desperately gullible letterbox seeking junky <br/>
(namely, my husband) to open the door only to have you two Jump out <br/>
of the darkness screaming - scaring the pants off the poor guy (if I <br/>
paid ya, would you do it again? lololol!).<br/>
<br/>
MonoLinguaPuss was the only "kid" there after dinner, but man did he <br/>
have a blast riding his bike around the park boxing with people to <br/>
locate the easy and moderately difficult boxes with his father's <br/>
trusty headlamp.  He even found 2 boxes, in the dark, that we hadn't <br/>
yet looked for!  (he loved the glow sticks for the 12 night boxes SB).<br/>
<br/>
Boxing from dawn til dusk and into the night.   Now *that's* what I <br/>
call !boxing!  We all went to bed utterly exhausted last night and <br/>
when MLP has to be woken up in the morning because he's still so <br/>
tired, lol... you *know* you've put on a great event... =:D<br/>
<br/>
We thank you, from the bottom of our hearts, for this wonderful <br/>
experience, and we thank everyone who was there that we met, for <br/>
being such wonderful people and allowing us to share this experience <br/>
with you.  (We were a little worried no one would show up with the <br/>
rain being as bad as it was before, around, noon time).<br/>
