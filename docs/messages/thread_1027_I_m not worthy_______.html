Sunday - Bought Pink Stuff and White stuff and a carving tool.  <br/>
Stayed up til Midnight and went to sleep with visions of curly <br/>
shavings on my kitchen table.<br/>
<br/>
Monday - Overtired I went back to Michael's for more pink stuff.  <br/>
Somehow I prefer ruining that over the white stuff.  Also decided I <br/>
need an Exacto knife.<br/>

Tuesday - Used exacto knife for first time.  <br/>

Wednesday - It is hard to carve with a band-aid on your index finger.<br/>

Thursday - Did you know pink stuff can double as a coaster?<br/>

</span></blockquote>Hi there!  I myself have carved only 3 stamps...I know a few of you <br/>
here have seen &amp; recieved my personal traveler, and I got a lot of <br/>
positive feedback from it, too. *grins*<br/>
<br/>
I remembered seeing a message here from Brian of TeamGreenDragon on <br/>
carving a stamp (I printed it out, too -- it's around this messy room <br/>
somewhere...)<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I searched for it in the archives and I found it.<br/>
<br/>
Message 754:<br/>
<br/>
Hi DragonLady and NannyBell,<br/>
<br/>
Truth is, there is no real secret, I don't believe I'm doing<br/>
anything different than anybody else who is carving. I use a #11 X-<br/>
Acto knife under a lighted magnifying glass.<br/>
I think the quality of your initial image transfer can make a big<br/>
difference in the final outcome of your stamp. I started with the<br/>
acetone (nail polish) transfer process, but found this to be a bit<br/>
messy. Sometimes the paper would leave particles stuck to the carving<br/>
material and also the edges of the image would tend to blur from the<br/>
edge of my hand rubbing repeatedly along it. Anybody who has seen my<br/>
Strix Varia stamp should know that the image for that was originally<br/>
much larger, but after carving out the middle section I had pretty<br/>
much rendered the outer portions unusable. I ended up cutting these<br/>
sections away resulting in the image as it is now. After<br/>
experimenting with the heat transfer method (iron) I have had much<br/>
better results with the transferring of images. I have found that a<br/>
very crisp bold image can be obtained. Like I said this may take some<br/>
experimentation on your part. I found that a low heat over longer<br/>
time worked better for me, although I've spoke with others who found<br/>
a quick blast of high heat works wonders for them. This may have<br/>
something to do with the toner being used in the particular copier<br/>
being used. You want to find an older model that uses heat to bind<br/>
the toner to the paper. Libraries and drug stores often have these<br/>
older models. I myself am going to keep my eyes open come yard sale<br/>
season, I hope to be able to pick one up at a reasonable price to<br/>
have at home.<br/>
After obtaining a good image to start with, it becomes a matter of<br/>
how much time are you willing to commit to the stamp. Something I<br/>
know is going into the wild I tend to pick a somewhat simpler, easier<br/>
to carve image than one I know will be safe, such as an event stamp<br/>
or a personal traveler ( that's if I had a personal traveler) or, am<br/>
I'm not sure why this is, but a stamp I was giving to someone else to<br/>
hide. I tend to carve in short spurts over a long period of time.<br/>
About an hour and a half to two hours, with breaks as I feel I need<br/>
them, is all I'm good for before my eyes are shot. Once I realize I'm<br/>
having difficulty with my eyes or keeping my hand steady I will put<br/>
things away for the night (yeah right, Lori wishes this were the<br/>
case, actually every thing is left all over the kitchen table) and<br/>
pick up were I left off when I have the time and the inclination to<br/>
do so.<br/>
I've also found that throwing the stamp in the fridge to cool it<br/>
down a bit will make it harder. This makes smaller areas that need to<br/>
come out easier to deal with as the knife is more likely to cut thru<br/>
the material rather than kind of tear thru. The Poe stamp had many<br/>
such areas and spent a good deal of time sitting next to the<br/>
margarine in our fridge. You don't want to freeze it, just get it<br/>
cold.<br/>
Also I tend to be a bit obsessive about things and am constantly<br/>
thinking about the particular stamp I am working on. I will make<br/>
copies of the original artwork and keep one pinned to my bulletin<br/>
board here at work and can't walk through my kitchen without picking<br/>
the stamp up and looking at it, planning were my next knife cuts will<br/>
be.<br/>
I hope this long winded answer will help out. Any other specific<br/>
questions you may have, just email me and I will do my best to answer<br/>
them. There are also many sources on the web you should read, Silent<br/>
Doug, Ryan C., and Mitch "Der Mad Stamper", all have excellent<br/>
tutorials that will give a basic know how of stamp carving.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for you comments!<br/>

<br/>
My Personal Traveler is the Survivor Logo -- I printed the image off <br/>
the web, traced it onto tracing paper, then I flipped the tracing <br/>
paper over and rubbed it onto a large eraser...then the carving <br/>
began! (It took me a lot of time to finish carving it!)<br/>
<br/>
Hope the message above helps - it did for me!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with carving, and hope to meet you in the future!<br/>
