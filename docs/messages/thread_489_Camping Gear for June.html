<br/>
My Troop web site has a summer camp and backpack gear check list on it .  You could adapt it for any type of camping though.  It's <a href="http://troop_12ba.tripod.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://troop_12ba.tripod.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Have a great summer camping and letterboxing.<br/>

<br/>
I am by no means a camping expert.  However, I would be more than <br/>
happy to post the information I gave my class about camping gear.  I <br/>
can only suggest what has worked well for me.  Some may agree others <br/>
will not.  Look for this information to be posted on my website next <br/>
week.<br/>
