Lenny of the Needeeps and me.  We hiked, walked, and biked our way in a <br/>
huge circle.  Only one box was found flooded,  one we think missing and <br/>
all the other 20 odd ones in great shape.  One H.H. Raido, wet and now <br/>
drying out in my sun room .  With the help of a heads up from ours and <br/>
everyone's  friend ;-) , we found two unpublished ones.  Lenny was a <br/>
great host .  We biked the dike for the Needeeps Florida State Quarter <br/>
stamp and his choice of placement  for his quarters , as always is  well <br/>
thought out. :-)   Thanks Lenny and all the planters for a fun filled day.<br/>
