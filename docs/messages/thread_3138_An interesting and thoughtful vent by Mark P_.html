I enjoy "regular (non mystery)" boxes the same as everyone else, but <br/>
I would have to say that I truly do a "HAPPY DANCE" (for those of you <br/>
who know a particular group of boxers who really do a happy dance <br/>
when they find a hard box... you know what I mean.  Who said winged <br/>
ones can't dance ;-) when I go and find a mystery box.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, Fish or Man, Brandy, Bluebird and I found two fairly new <br/>
mystery boxes.  Boy did we do a HAPPY DANCE!  It was a very <br/>
satisfying thing!<br/>
<br/>
I would have to say that I agree somewhat with Mark's frustration, <br/>
though the two mysteries we found recently were very good ones and <br/>
fairly difficult ones to find.  Having planted my share of mystery <br/>
boxes, I have a tendency to really cherish the mystery boxes that are <br/>
really hard to find.  Those are memories that last, and that I truly <br/>
cherish.  I'm attempting to figure out two mystery boxes now, that <br/>
I'm having a VERY hard time with.  I haven't had a chance to <br/>
letterbox out on the West Coast, but judging by the letterboxing <br/>
characters we have out there (some of whom I've met along the way <br/>
here on the East Coast), I can just imagine what kind of mysteries <br/>
they have out there!<br/>
<br/>
As for the quantity of mystery boxes here in the northeast, I've <br/>
found that a lot of the recent planting has been done by newer boxers <br/>
(we had eight boxes planted here in Manchester alone within the last <br/>
week or two by a new boxer).  Furthermore, when I talk with new <br/>
boxers about mystery boxes, they say that they don't "DO" mystery <br/>
boxes.  Perhaps a poll should be done on the newbie list to see why?<br/>
<br/>
I personally don't want to see the "dumbing down" of letterboxing.  I <br/>
really enjoy a challenge now and then.  I thoroughly enjoyed planting <br/>
with Enologist when she planted the two boxes she has, and from what <br/>
she tells me, only a few people have found them.  I don't think <br/>
you've found THOSE Mark ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there have been quite a few mystery boxes that I haven't been <br/>
able to find on the first try.  (There have been plenty of regular <br/>
non-mystery boxes that I haven't found on the first try!)  For some, <br/>
that may be just too discouraging.  Once I heard about the elusive <br/>
one from Maine, I too was hooked, and have found quite a few of his <br/>
boxes (and would enjoy more clues if anyone has them ;-).  <br/>
<br/>
My take on it is, that we have quite a few passive, "recreational" <br/>
letterboxers here in CT.  Now, I know what you're saying... isn't <br/>
letterboxing a recreational activity anyway?????  I use that term to <br/>
mean those families who do it once in a while, who never strive to <br/>
finish a town, a county, or a state.  We have quite a few <br/>
letterboxers who find a few, plant a few, then never to be heard from <br/>
again.  I find that we don't have nearly as many active, diehard <br/>
letterboxers in CT... those who will find boxes on a regular basis, <br/>
those who carve their own stamps, and plant boxes on a semi-regular <br/>
basis, and while doing this, hone in on their skills as a <br/>
letterboxer.  Once those few diehard letterboxers find the boxes <br/>
(with many of them having most of the boxes in the state already, <br/>
they go out almost immediately to hunt them down), then boxes get <br/>
very little activity.<br/>
<br/>
I sincerely hope that everyone goes out and plants a mystery box.  <br/>
They are really fun, and very satisfying to find!!!!!  As Mark would <br/>
say.... Get out there and BOX!  (mystery box that is ;-)<br/>

</span></blockquote>   I love doing mystery boxes. I'll always remember the first one I <br/>
found, it was the third time I had been there looking and when I <br/>
lifted that rock and there it was, well I'll just never forget the <br/>
thrill of that find.<br/>
   I have spent many nights going over the places in my mind when I <br/>
should be sleeping, and then all of a sudden it's like a light goes <br/>
on and I know exactly where the box is and it takes all I can do not <br/>
to go jumping in the car and looking in the middle of the night.<br/>
<br/>
   This past month, my adult son and I have been hunting down <br/>
Paige's tales in Ct. This is probably the most fun I have ever had <br/>
letterboxing in over 3 yrs. We have found about 20 of them and will <br/>
be back to get them all. The clues are so clever and some of the <br/>
hiding places are just great. I made maps of the pixie lands and all <br/>
the places in the story. <br/>
  Except for a couple of people who did them when they first came <br/>
out, no one has done these boxes. We were first finders on Tale 6, <br/>
which was placed 2 yrs ago. And this is in heavely boxed Ct.<br/>
<br/>
  So many boxes now are placed in parking lots, I drive by 2 <br/>
recently placed ones everyday; but I won't stop to get them, my own <br/>
little protest I guess.<br/>
  So keep those mystery boxes coming, not all of us like being lead <br/>
to the box by the nose.<br/>

It was great seeing everyone and especially great to meet Bella! I got to<br/>
meet some new boxers and to get some exchanges. I hope to continue this<br/>
tradition, even though I have to use some hiding places over again. I hope<br/>
everyone who attended had a good time. Sorry to Northstar, Moonbeam and<br/>
Bella for keeping you out so late to see the fireworks, but they were fun to<br/>
watch! Thanks again.<br/>
