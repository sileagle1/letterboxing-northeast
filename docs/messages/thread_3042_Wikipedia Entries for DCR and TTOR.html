<br/>
In addition to letterboxing, I spend a fair amount of time editing <br/>
Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia.<br/>
<br/>
I've engaged myself in two related projects lately -- one, to <br/>
catalog and create pages for all lands managed by Massachusetts' <br/>
Department of Conservation and Recreation, and two, to do the same <br/>
for lands owned by The Trustees of Reservations.<br/>
<br/>
Once those are complete, I'll likely move on to other noteworthy <br/>
land conservation and historic preservation groups such as the <br/>
Massachusetts Audubon Society or Historic New England.<br/>
<br/>
The project is far from complete, and most of the information on <br/>
Wikipedia is sourced from the respective organization's websites, <br/>
but you might find it a useful reference.  There'll be more progress <br/>
in the next couple of weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I've updated the TTOR page, but have not yet added or <br/>
revised pages for their holdings.  Conversely, I've added or revised <br/>
a number of pages for DCR holdings, but have not yet updated the DCR <br/>
page itself.<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested in taking a look or tracking the progress, the <br/>
top articles are below:<br/>

original!) - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:CPAScott" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:CPAScott</a><br/>
