<br/>
Sorry, we missed this conversation and definitely welcome to the gang!<br/>
<br/>
We box with 2 boys ages 3 and 6.  The 3yrold just likes to romp outside so, he is usually without complaint.  The 6 yr old just took up his own logbook that he controls.  He stamps what, when and where he wants and Mom doesn't have a say.  He loves having the decision and it has made him more interested in boxing again.  <br/>
<br/>
Other tips:  <br/>
- we always bring snacks and drinks (the older one loves to carry his own).  Oh and be sure to clean your hands well after snacks because animals have much better noses than we humans.<br/>
<br/>
- we also try to include a fun outing like a playground or like was already mentioned picking up shells.  We have also brought picnics, gone to the zoo, got ice cream, and an occasional happy meal helps sometimes, too.<br/>
<br/>
- Be prepared and be flexible because sometimes the plan just needs to go out the window for it to be a fun day.<br/>
<br/>
Most of all, to us there is nothing better than having a great walk together in the great outdoors.  Letterboxing helps take us there.  Enjoy the adventure!<br/>
