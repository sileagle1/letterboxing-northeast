Great Dane/Shepherd mix, bridle coat.  And yes, he has his own <br/>

was actually present at your gathering. You know, I remember joking<br/>
about this at the Laudholm Gathering back in march. Do you folks<br/>
remember me laughing as I took the group shot? <br/>

<br/>
While I was there I saw a deer while I was stamping into Boo! She jumped away when she saw me and then came back and stood off the trail watching me. I then ran down to grab Duct Tape and Whimsy. (This stamp changes from time to time and I try to get each one!) And when I came back up to go back to my car....the deer was there again waiting and watching me! It was so awesome! <br/>
<br/>
I went by myself as Bunny Swordsman is still on the mend and Kirby Swordsman didn't want to go. The sad thing is I didn't have my camera with me. I usually bring it when I am with the Swordsmen but I didn't bring it because it was just me! Of course...if the Swordsmen were with me I'm sure they would have scared the deer off way before we got near her!<br/>
<br/>
She was awesome! This is what letterboxing is all about! Finding great letterboxes and enjoying nature! Thank you Cavy Lovers! <br/>

Tomorrow is the most important thing in life. Comes into us at midnight very clean. It's perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands. It hopes we've learned something from yesterday. <br/>

event the MMM was, so well organized!  It was my nephews' first <br/>
letterboxing gathering and they were thrilled with every aspect. All of <br/>
you involved did a fantastic job.  It was nice to meet new people and <br/>
reconnect with familiar faces.<br/>
<br/>
And all the boxes/stamps are just the best.  Thanks to all involved!<br/>
