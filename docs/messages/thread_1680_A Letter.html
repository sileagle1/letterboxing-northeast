                I was watching one of your movies today and it got <br/>
me to thinking about how much emptier the world is without you. You <br/>
entertained us all in so many ways that you may never know. I hope <br/>
that wherever you are, you can look back and see that you meant so <br/>
much to so many people and smile. I have nothing to offer in return <br/>
but for a small gift. Rest easy my dear, your legacy will live on <br/>
forever.<br/>
                                        ~ a friend<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
             ~not where she is,<br/>
              but where she used to be,<br/>
              off four-six-two,<br/>
              divided by three.<br/>
              The monument is nice,<br/>
              yet not what you seek,<br/>
              look low in the wall,<br/>
              that's away from the street.~<br/>
<br/>
                                              ABSOLUTE discretion is<br/>
                                              greatly appreciated.</div>
