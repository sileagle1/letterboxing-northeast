&lt;&lt;&lt;Join us for another fun and exciting Great Park Pursuit on <br/>
Saturday, October 21, 10:00 AM - 3 PM, at Goodwin Forest Conservation <br/>
Center located in northeastern Connecticut off Rt. 6 on Potter Rd. in <br/>
Hampton ( <a href="http://www.dep.state.ct.us/educ/goodwin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dep.state.ct.us/educ/goodwin</a> ). Come with us as <br/>
we take a hike on a small section of the Air Line Trail during what <br/>
is thought to be this year's peak viewing time for fall foliage. This <br/>
beautiful 50-mile trail begins in East Hampton and ends in Putnam, <br/>
the section that we will hike goes through the 2,000-acre Goodwin <br/>
State Forest and is located within the Quinebaug-Shetucket Rivers <br/>
National Heritage Corridor, a key link in a proposed interstate trail <br/>
system. It is a great place to ride a bike, go horseback riding, jog <br/>
or take a leisurely stroll. <br/>
<br/>
Discover why leaves change color and take part in a leaf hunt relay, <br/>
test your skills at letterboxing and orienteering, sample some CT <br/>
grown produce, carve a pumpkin, see some of the horses that help <br/>
patrol our CT State Parks and Forests, meet new, and reconnect with <br/>
old, friends. Bring a picnic lunch and your hiking shoes. The trail <br/>
is relatively flat and excellent for beginner hikers. Bring your <br/>
family and friends. Everyone is welcome to come. <br/>
