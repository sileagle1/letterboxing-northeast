I can't find any clues for it on LB.org or AQ.  It said it was placed to commemorate a gathering a while back.  Does anyone know who owns this box?  Are there not supposed to be clues published?  I was just wondering if someone had forgotten about it.  It's such a beautiful stamp and I think others should also be able to enjoy it.<br/>
