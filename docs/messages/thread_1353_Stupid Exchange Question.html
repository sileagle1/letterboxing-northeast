</span></blockquote>Hi- We've been boxing for a year and a half, and as far as I know, an <br/>
exchange is when you and another boxer exchange personal stamp images <br/>
in each other's logbooks.  If you carved your signature stamp, then <br/>
so be it, but it is not mandatory that you do so.  Be prepared for a <br/>
crazed experience of exchanges at this huge MMM Gather!!! Happy <br/>

logs -- *NOT* the exchange of rubber stamps themselves!<br/>
