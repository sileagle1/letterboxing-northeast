TRAVELINGFROG<br/>
<br/>
If you or someone you know knows either the OTHER Flutterby and/or  <br/>
her mother, Travelingfrog, please help us straighten this out. I  <br/>
believe they live in the Fairfield, CT area. Email us off list.<br/>
<br/>
who was that private dic that DerMadStamper hired? . . . Inspector  <br/>
Clouseau? ah I don't remember. . .<br/>
<br/>
Help! I don't want to be blamed for loosing this PLB . . . but please  <br/>
don't let this incident reflect on my PLB ring skills. . . really I  <br/>
am usually so good. . . I even chased my dog for one hour to retrieve  <br/>
a box, it was a bit chewed and drooly but I retrieved it . . . and  <br/>
then there was that one time I thought a PLB was junkmail and I  <br/>
tossed it only to spend the next two days at the dump looking for it.  <br/>
Found it underneath some crusty bread and some used kleenex . . . and  <br/>
then . . . well . . . anyhoo<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
