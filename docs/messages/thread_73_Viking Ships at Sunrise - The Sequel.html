the second time, we replanted the third box for Trish in November - <br/>
only to discover on further inspection that boxes #1 and #2 were <br/>
actually there!<br/>
<br/>
After combing through the log books of VSS #1 and #2, there was a <br/>
possibility that Palantir and Traveler with a Twist were also buried <br/>
under there.<br/>
<br/>
Today, I went up to the location of this letterbox, and tunneled from <br/>
one end to the other.  There are no missing letterboxes - the only <br/>
thing in the location is the VSS #3.<br/>
<br/>
We filled the center of the location with large stones and rocks to <br/>
avoid any more boxes falling into the abyss, and the box was <br/>
replanted securely at the correct compass location.  I was lucky, <br/>
though!  A HH was inside - all the way from Oregon!  From Pandora, to <br/>
boot!<br/>
<br/>
Mystery solved, and further problems now avoided.<br/>
<br/>
I also returned the logs and stamps from VSS #1 and #2 to Trish today.<br/>
