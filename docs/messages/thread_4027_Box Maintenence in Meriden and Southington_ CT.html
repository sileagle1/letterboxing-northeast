<br/>
In Meriden:<br/>
<br/>
First Time under the Sea is alive and well.  Boxes are intact and dry and where they should be.<br/>
<br/>
Sonic and Friends - Tails is gone.  Clues have been updated to reflect this.  This is a 2-box series now.<br/>
<br/>
In Southington- National Parks - Zion is gone and I changed the location of the last box (due to a tree used in the clues no longer being visible - it disintegrated).  Clues have been updated to reflect the changes.  This series is now a 4-box series.  Boxes are dry and intact and logbook was changed.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for finding.<br/>
<br/>
