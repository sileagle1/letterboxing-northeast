<br/>
Come up 395 north to exit 97 9route 44)  Take a right off the exit past McDonalds and Dunkin Donuts.<br/>
<br/>
You want to go 3.5 miles to a 4 way intersection (go past the first sign to Quaddick)<br/>
<br/>
At the intersection there is a large red house on your right.  Turn left.<br/>
<br/>
Now go 2.8 miles (you will pass through a crooked 4 way intersection along the way)<br/>
<br/>
You will se the entrance to Quaddick on your left.  Follow the signs for the Gathering.<br/>
<br/>
See you there!<br/>

letterboxing friends!  Though I was overtired, and it was raining, I still thoroughly <br/>
enjoyed myself!  A very special THANK YOU goes to The Maplines, Teach and <br/>
Preach, Bald Eagle and Momma Fox for all of the work you did!  The food was <br/>
fantastic (BTW... Bluebird.... I NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU PUT IN THAT TORTELLINI <br/>
RECIPE!!!!!  I was the one who ate up almost the entire bowl!), the boxes were <br/>
great, and not too long, so people were able to also spend time in the pavilion, <br/>
exchanging, eating (I did mostly that!) etc....<br/>
<br/>
Oh btw.... Who made the Asian Salad?  One of the letterboxers at the gather <br/>
wanted the recipe.  I can try to send it along to her, if someone could get me <br/>
the recipe.....  I wish I could have had a taste, but I have a nut allergy.....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to everyone for a great day!<br/>

hosting this second annual May Day gala event. I visited with old <br/>
letterboxing friends and met lots of new folks too. As Mayeve so well <br/>
expressed, making new connections with others is what its all about.  <br/>
Happy May Day everyone!!<br/>

Eagle!  So great to meet up with new people and reconnect with old friends.  <br/>
And the scavenger hunt was awesome (even though Northstar scared the life out <br/>
of me by hiding in that duck blind while I looked for the box... "LOOKING FOR <br/>
SOMETHING???").  :)  <br/>
<br/>
Everyone had a great time!  I can't wait for the next gather.  :)<br/>

Kellie and I had a great time today.  We're glad you guys decided to<br/>
have it.  How's your back feeling, Paul?  Rough day, yikes!!!  With<br/>
that being said, I won't even get started about the hot dogs.  The<br/>
cocktail weiners would have been hysterical though.  Anyhow, thanks<br/>
again guys and we hope to see you soon.<br/>

<br/>
I am SO glad everyone had such a great time, and so happy to hear that everyone liked the scavenger hunt idea!  I was a little worried when the rain didn't seem to want to stop Sunday morning, but I guess I shouldn't have been!<br/>
<br/>
I really want to thank some people too;  Teach and Preach (Robin &amp; Dan) especially.  When I asked them to help me I promised them to have all the stamps carved and boxes ready to hide many weeks in advance.  Well, we all know how life can get in the way!  I didn't have the boxes ready until Monday night!  They were still willing to help!! So a BIG thankyou to you guys for sticking with me.<br/>
<br/>
Another thank you goes to Sue (Sojourner) for all the online support she gave.  She was the one who convinced me to rethink the whole thing when I cancelled a few weeks ago.  She emailed me often to see how things were progressing and "listened" when things weren't going quite the way I had planned.  So, thank you Sue!<br/>
<br/>
Mark Pepe to the rescue!!  The bad thing about a free website.......you can't have hundreds of people all trying to get information and clues all at once, it'll shut the site down!!  Mark was so kind to put all the info on his wonderful site and saved the day!  Thank you Mark!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Sunshine and Swamp Yankee for the truckload of firewood!  And also to all the others who donated wood.  Unfortunately Bald Eagle is not good with names and couldn't tell me who you all were!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Mary from the Maplines for helping with cleanup!<br/>
<br/>
And most of all, thanks to my husband, Bald Eagle, for sticking with me and telling me to go ahead and plan this thing even though he felt I had too much on my plate already!<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Bald Eagle,  he would like to thank Mark, Brian and he thinks Grumpy (?) for thier support with that little incident!<br/>
<br/>
I can't believe how many of you are already talking about next year!  There will have to be a slight change in dates if I do this next year.  My son is getting married April 29th so it'll be after that.  Dont' you worry, I'm already thinking!  But, Brian........I don't know about 40-50 of them!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, sorry Seth about the hotdogs!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Everybody rest up the weekends looking good so far!<br/>
