and easily accessible.   They have a website and you can e-mail them <br/>
for rates.  Bangor is about a two  hour drive from the Harbor.<br/>

plenty of places to stay on Rt 1 or in and around Boothbay. <br/>
<br/>
You might try looking into nearby towns like Edgecomb, Damariscotta, Wiscasset. Even <br/>
Rockland is just a little over an hour NE on Route 1. ANd there are plenty of boxes to and <br/>
from Boothbay!<br/>

that I don't have any personal experience of them--but Route 1 is full of motels <br/>
for regular folks who can't sign off to the expense account or the titanium <br/>
