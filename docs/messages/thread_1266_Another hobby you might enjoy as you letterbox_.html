stamping, but since we got into letterboxing through it, we thought <br/>
it might interest a lot of you!<br/>
<br/>
While at the Gateway Arch one year, we picked up a thing called <br/>
Passport to You National Parks. We're both into historical and <br/>
natural places, so we decided to check it out. Apparently, each year, <br/>
the National Park Service puts out little color stamps for every <br/>
region and sells them in a sheet of about 10. There's always a <br/>
picture of one of the NPS parks and a blurb under it about the park's <br/>
history or something). When you go to any national park, they'll let <br/>
you get a cancellation stamp to prove you've been there, like a <br/>
passport stamp (see our website to see what these looks like <br/>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/dasprite222/passport.htm)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/dasprite222/passport.htm)</a>. You collect them <br/>
in the passport book just like we do with letterbox stamps, except <br/>
botht the booklet and the stamps are already made for you. The <br/>
passport book itself also comes with all sorts of info about the <br/>
parks and regions.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, it's not as personalized as letterboxing is, but <br/>
it's a fun way to see US parks and such. You can buy both stamps and <br/>
the little book (only about 6 inches by 3 inches) at any national <br/>
park or order them from www.eparks.com. Again, you don't have to do <br/>
this, but we figured this sort of interest crosses over into <br/>
letterboxing territory (especially since we plan our vacations around <br/>
national parks AND letterboxes now)!<br/>
