They not only usurped our hiding spot, but took the contents of our box and placed it in their Geocache bin. <br/>
Pardon me for sounding a bit rough around the edges, but I am a bit miffed. They never contacted us about doing this and now we have had to pull this box (temporarily,hopefully). If anyone knows the owner of BeaverCub Geocache - please have them contact me. Since we have asked permission of the owners of the site to plant there and we were there first, I feel we have the right to be in the spot. And the Geocache should have found another spot. <br/>
This Letterbox has been enjoyed by many boxers out there and we hope to get it back in circulation soon.<br/>

We have come to the conclusion that this is a novice Geocacher and the box is unlisted. As with many Letterboxers, most Geocachers do not subsribe to their Forum(Chat List), so it is not possible to track them down. I should have left a note in their box asking why they would do such a rude thing, but I was sure it would not come out well. I have cooled off considerably and perhaps I will pen something and stick it in the box. I'm sure that thse people are pretty clueless. ooops, guess I'm not ready to write that note yet.:)<br/>
Dave and I have removed the contents of our box from the geocache and will look for a new spot within the battery. On retrospect, the site was a little too obvious and public. It was always difficult to stamp in or do maintenance without someone or some inquisitive dog coming along. So, watch for new clues for this box - it is a favorite of Dave's. <br/>
