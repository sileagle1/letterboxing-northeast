They can usually try to get a conservation officer or park manager to <br/>
let your car out if they lock it in.   Of course, If you make them <br/>
pay someone overtime, you might get a nice little ticket too! <br/>
<br/>
Yeah they mean sunset....however still being light out and locked <br/>
already seems a bit... excessive? on their part. <br/>

Of course with Bluebird there I'm suprised she didn't hop in Pam's <br/>
car and [try to] drive over the gate &lt;&lt;grinning&gt;&gt;<br/>

 She can get any information that you might be hiding in your head.  ?? <br/>
And short, yes--but I hiked with her yesterday as she carried her <br/>
grandson -almost walking-  in a back pack that was almost as tall as she <br/>
--up hills and down rocks as we planted a new series she has created. <br/>
She is tiny but very strong and a dear friend.<br/>

What Patrick failed to mention is that shortly there<br/>
after he and <br/>
Bluebird went in 1/2's on a small portable acetylene<br/>
torch set-up to <br/>
have on hand just in case.... Bluebird was reluctant<br/>
to shell out the <br/>
dough and was heard mumbling "But I like to go<br/>
4-wheelin' " while <br/>
attending the last gathering.   Patrick, as the mighty<br/>
lion would do, <br/>
roared "We don't need no stinkin' bolt cutters!".<br/>
<br/>
And now for something completely different....<br/>

I have been quiet about this thread, but just Have to<br/>
join in.  Yes,  it <br/>
is the same Bluebird,  'short and very nice',  but not<br/>
'kind of quiet' <br/>
 She can get any information that you might be hiding<br/>
in your head.  ?? <br/>
And short, yes--but I hiked with her yesterday as she<br/>
carried her <br/>
grandson -almost walking-  in a back pack that was<br/>
almost as tall as she <br/>
--up hills and down rocks as we planted a new series<br/>
she has created. <br/>
She is tiny but very strong and a dear friend.<br/>
there-- I feel better!<br/>

Of course we all know it was just funning with Bluebird,  she has the <br/>
last laugh as she does not regularly look at the talk list,  Her ears <br/>
must be burning,  she will have a big smile when she finally does read it.<br/>
BTW to you 2 -- I did e mail you off line and tell you the fun we had <br/>
finding your mystery at the Cape.  Don't tell me you did not get my <br/>
'report"  or was it too long to read ? :-D<br/>

OK.... I think Paul was just joking here!  I'm sure<br/>
there was no offense of <br/>
Bluebird intended.  As many of us who know Bluebird<br/>
know, she's very head <br/>
strong and will go after something at all costs!  Kind<br/>
of sounds like me to some <br/>
extent.....<br/>
<br/>
BTW... Butterfly, did you get my new mystery box while<br/>
out on the Cape?????  <br/>
I never heard back ;-)<br/>

I have been quiet about this thread, but just Have to<br/>
join in.  Yes,  it <br/>
is the same Bluebird,  'short and very nice',  but not<br/>
'kind of quiet' <br/>
She can get any information that you might be hiding<br/>
in your head.  ?? <br/>
And short, yes--but I hiked with her yesterday as she<br/>
carried her <br/>
grandson -almost walking-  in a back pack that was<br/>
almost as tall as she <br/>
--up hills and down rocks as we planted a new series<br/>
she has created. <br/>
She is tiny but very strong and a dear friend.<br/>
there-- I feel better!<br/>

Ok that's it I am going to buy a brand spanken new<br/>
HUMMER H2O so I can go over water and carry a<br/>
torch,Bolt cutters and a Machine Gun ( only to get<br/>
slow people out of the way.) HEHEHEHE<br/>
I wouldn't joke about the Machine Gun around here! <br/>
We've been having windows <br/>
shot out of cars with bee bee guns and marbles on I-91<br/>
lately!  I drive up in <br/>
that neck of the woods a lot for work (and boxing<br/>
too), and it makes me want <br/>
to not drive in Springfield/Longmeadow area.<br/>
<br/>
Note to self: watch out for Paul of Maplines in new<br/>
Hummer with machine <br/>
gun.....<br/>
<br/>
