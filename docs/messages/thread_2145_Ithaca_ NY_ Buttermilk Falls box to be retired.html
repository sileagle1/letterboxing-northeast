will be retired not long after the Finger Lakes, NY gathering this coming <br/>
Saturday. This adopted box has a full logbook and a cracked container. The <br/>
out-of-state planter didn't care if the box remained in place or not when I <br/>
contacted her to adopt it a couple of years ago, so that combined with the <br/>
new NY state park geocache permit policy (which may or may not apply to <br/>
letterboxes) has led to my decision to retire the box instead of sprucing <br/>
it up.<br/>
<br/>
If you'll be in town for the gathering, don't miss it! I highly recommend <br/>
parking at the lower lot so that you can fully appreciate the beauty of the <br/>
gorge as you hike (parking details are in the clues). Buttermilk Falls is <br/>
truly spectacular, so take advantage of this last opportunity to find one <br/>
of Central NY's oldest boxes while you still can.<br/>
