and if it isnt well hidden, bring it in. The following is from an<br/>
email I recieved at work today:<br/>
<br/>
On Saturday, May 12, 2007, there will be a statewide cleanup effort to<br/>
get parks and beaches across Massachusetts ready for summer.<br/>
Volunteers are needed to help spruce up park facilities, clean<br/>
coastlines, maintain trails, plant flowers, and more. This effort is<br/>
being led by the office of Governor Deval Patrick, the Office of<br/>
Energy and Environmental Affairs, and the Department of Conservation<br/>
and Recreation (DCR).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[We are] getting involved! Through stewardship, we can help to improve<br/>
the quality of life in our neighboring communities. We are organizing<br/>
a cleanup challenge and are asking you to lend a hand to help clean up<br/>
Callahan State Park in Framingham. Both the DCR and the Town of<br/>
Framingham are our clients. Let's show them we care! <br/>
<br/>
Callahan State Park in Framingham is a 820-acre day use area with<br/>
seven miles of marked trails and is used for activities that include<br/>
fishing, hiking, horseback riding and cross-country skiing. Within the<br/>
park are nearly 100 acres of open fields, 70 acres of which are<br/>
currently under an agricultural lease. [We] will be assisting in<br/>
cleanup activities through the park. I encourage all of you to<br/>
participate!<br/>
<br/>
Children of all ages are welcome so we encourage employees to bring<br/>
their families! This is also a great way for all of us to have some<br/>
fun while getting to know other people in the company. I plan to be<br/>
there and hope to see many of you there as well.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails,<br/>
