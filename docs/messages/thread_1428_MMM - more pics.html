Mansfield Monster Mash.  KUDOs and many thanks to all those that took <br/>
part in putting in on. The hard work paid off....the event went <br/>
smooth as silk. It was great fun.  I only wish I had more time <br/>
there...<br/>
<br/>
We brought a couple of newbies with us...just imagine your <br/>
introduction to letterboxing being the MMM!  They went home with a <br/>
book full of stamps!  They were really impressed. Everyone was just <br/>
great...very friendly, very happy to be there and all having a great <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
I did a collage of the pics my hubby took...it's kind of large so be <br/>
patient loading it....<br/>

of the MMM boxes....so I'm quite sure it's been picked up by <br/>
now!  : )</div>
