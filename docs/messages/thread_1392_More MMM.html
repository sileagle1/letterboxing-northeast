exchanges (hey it was my first event!) but some finds as well.<br/>
<br/>
But the best part of the day by far was the realization that <br/>
letterboxers are from all varying size, shape, color, gender, age, <br/>
occupation, location etc. etc. etc.  What an all inclusive group of <br/>
people!  With some hobbies - well lets just say that for some <br/>
hobbies you sometimes must have a special skill to fit in.  But with <br/>
letterboxing, pretty much anyone can do this.  Yes some of us are <br/>
still befuzzled by those "deep clues" and others will never carve a <br/>
stamp that is worth letting the dog chew on.  But that doesn't <br/>
matter.  I have never felt more welcomed in another group before. It <br/>
was so nice to finally put a face to those trail names/stamps that I <br/>
see floating around on the boxes that I have found or on the <br/>
website.   Thank you so much for a wonderful day!<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing!!<br/>
