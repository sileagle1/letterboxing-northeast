Here's what we accomplished today-<br/>
<br/>
DEP Naugatuck State Forest<br/>
DEP Topsmead State Forest<br/>
Lil' Banditos' Hermansita<br/>
   -  We didn't look for the second box (Fernando) we had already <br/>
found too many ticks on our legs and didn't wish to see more!<br/>
DEP Mattatuck State Forest<br/>
DEP Nepaug State Forest<br/>
Cunning Kids' Nepaug Series<br/>
  - Funny, as we located the 3rd box, we saw a father and two small <br/>
children coming up the trail, so we pretended to be doing something <br/>
else, hoping they would pass and we could get the LB unseen. Instead <br/>
they stopped, and the kids were obviously watching us. After a few <br/>
mins of both us and them trying to look like nothing was going on, <br/>
they asked if we were LBoxers and turns out it was the Cunning Kids <br/>
themselves! They were so happy to see us searching for their <br/>
letterboxes. It was really neat, and it was good to meet them and <br/>
their "cunning" dad and dog as well!<br/>
DEP Paugnut State Forest<br/>
<br/>
So now, needless to say, we are exhausted.. to think we had left with <br/>
clclues to over 20 boxes (just in case)... we could barely walk back <br/>
to the car from the 9th ! Ha ha ha.. All in all, beautiful weather.. <br/>
and even more beautiful parks! (If you've never been to Paugnut &amp; its <br/>
Burr Pond.. its a must see!)<br/>

I have to say, I admire your ability to skip Fernando.  ;)  I did it over the <br/>
summer.  In shorts. Yeah, I'm an idiot sometimes.  Ask Kreepy Kelli what my <br/>
legs looked like when she saw me the next day.  (I believe she said it looked <br/>
like I got into a fight with a weed wacker?)  And May Eve can attest to the <br/>
ugly poison ivy thing that was on the back of my left leg after that too...  <br/>
Yeah, skip Fernando!  ;)<br/>

<br/>
The Cunning Kids (and dad) weren't out letterboxing.. just hiking, <br/>
so no stamps were exchanged... does anyone still count this as an <br/>
exchange? <br/>
<br/>
What is correct letterboxer etiquitte for exchanging stamps? This is <br/>
the first boxer I've met, and I wasn't sure what to say (I'm sure as <br/>
I meet each of you, you'll come to find I'm pretty shy) Do you just <br/>
say.. "Would you please stamp my book?" <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to anyone who can answer an inexperienced boxing team!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-484889819">The first time I saw another boxer I was with a bunch of other NEW boxers, (see that as 6 screaming kids running down a hill in a cemetery) showing no respect for where we were.  I saw a lone man taking the same steps that were directed in the clues.  I so wanted to go and ask for an exchange but didn't want to put a "lone wolf" in the middle of such chaos I had with me but I did watch him and wish I got that exchange.  I went back to the box on one of the following days to see who it was and he didn't seem to stamp in.  I don't know why...  So I don't know who he was...mystery.<br/>
<br/>
My next experience was with Veronica and Tony (Tony was at work ;).  But we walked past each other.  And I had to be brave enough to go back and say something like are those clue sheets in your hand.  After that it was fun.  <br/>
<br/>
My next time was at Mansfield Monster Mash.  The highlight of boxing for us.  Walk in the woods on any day during then and make an exchange...  Giggling as we each pretend that it's natural to be walking in the woods with papers in hand.  Laughing when they are still looking and you've already stamped in.  "should we leave this out for you?"<br/>
<br/>
Be brave,  look for papers in their hands or ink on there fingers.  A simple leading question like whatcha up to might help you know if they are a lboxer or just an ordinary hiker.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1874601440">Glad to hear you had an enjoyable day.  It is, as you said, all about<br/>
the adventure, and what an adventure you had!  Focusing on the DEP<br/>
boxes is interesting ... from what I know of them (being a 'boxer from<br/>
MA), they are great, but often long, hikes!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, in the letterboxing mecca that is Connecticut, you'll<br/>
likely discover it easy to get many more boxes in your travels, but do<br/>
be sure to keep your focus on the enjoyment of the day!<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the hobby and good luck with your hunts!<br/>
