signed up for "Boxing by the Bay" on Sunday, Sep. 4th! To RSVP please<br/>
go to this page: <a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=62" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=62</a> <br/>
<br/>
Just a few reminders about the gathering for those who might be<br/>
traveling from far away.<br/>
<br/>
Please bring a picnic (brown bag) lunch for yourself. There are many<br/>
nearby lunch spots and a local natural foods Co-op, but there are no<br/>
cooking facilities or refrigeration in the park.  Bring a folding camp<br/>
chair if you have one. There will be picnic tables at the park.<br/>
<br/>
If you're still waiting to book a camp spot or reservation for that<br/>
weekend, I would suggest that you do that quickly. We have a list of<br/>
suggested spots for folks on our event page listing:<br/>

Dan and I are celebrating our 1st anniversary on Sept 18th but I can't take any time off for an extended weekend then. So we are going to Maine for this event and staying in "The White House" as an early get-away and then for our real anniversary we'll be home and available to celebrate with friends and/or family.  We haven't seen much of Maine together. We went to a gathering there a couple of years ago, and Dan has been to Mount Blue area...  but we don't get away much!  This will be perfect...  a romantic getaway AND letterboxing.  How good is THAT?!  :-)))))))     <br/>

Hey! Congrats on the upcoming anniversary. Isosceles and I just<br/>
