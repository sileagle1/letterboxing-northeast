                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-455686163">Hi all! We've been out busily doing our spring maintenance and have an old logbook sitting in the sun drying out. It's from a defunct box planted 2/15/00 that we called Charland's Neck after our mountain biking friend John Charland who actually broke his neck at the spot where the box was planted. (He's fine now thank goodness). We thought you might enjoy hearing the names of the boxers who found it way back when...<br/>
