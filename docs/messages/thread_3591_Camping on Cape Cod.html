<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We're throwing together a camping trip to Cape Cod.  We'll be arriving Sunday, August 19th and<br/>
leaving Wednesday, August 22nd.  We've reserved a group site 2 in area 2  at Shawme-Crowell State<br/>
Park in Sandwich that holds from 25 - 50 people.  Depending on how many we wind up with, the fee<br/>
could be as low a $1 per person per night (or less if we have more than 25 people).  So far we have<br/>
Kreepy Kelli and family, Talking Turtle and the Alphabet Bandits, and the Wildcats for a total of 10<br/>
people. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are definitely boxes on the Cape, - 30 in Sandwich, another 50 or so within 10 miles.  This<br/>
isn't a boxing event per se but there will be an "event" stamp, if anyone is interested we can night<br/>
box.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For those who have never been or are interested in going even if you have been, we'll be going on a<br/>
whale watching cruise leaving from nearby Barnstable on Tuesday. Which is about $35pp.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in joining us, e-mail me off list to reserve your spot at our group site and<br/>
if you'd like to join us for the Whale watching cruise.<br/>
<br/>
