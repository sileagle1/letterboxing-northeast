 <br/>
My, do we have a treat for you. An awesome way to spend your Summer.<br/>
 <br/>
Did you know that there is some incredible talent all over this great country of ours? Well, most of us will probably never box in all 50 states, and D.C., so we have brought them to you. <br/>
 <br/>
Some amazing and generous people from all over the country have contributed boxes for each of our beautiful states as well as D.C.<br/>
 <br/>
Some of these boxes are temporary. However, all of them will be in place starting today, Flag Day and going through the fourth of July, staying in place through the gathering associated with this series (America Boxes, which promises to hold more fun, and letterboxes!) and only a handful of them will be pulled after 9/11. If you want the complete set, then be sure to find them in the next three (3) months. <br/>
 <br/>
Seriously, this is an amazing collection of carvings that you won't want to miss. Come and see the way letterboxes are done all over the country.<br/>
 <br/>
We hope you have a lot of fun with this series. <br/>
 <br/>
Please remember to drop a line when recording your finds (if you do so). That way, the wonderfully generous people that live all over the country will be part of this awesome adventure also. After all, they are the ones that made it a reality. <br/>
 <br/>
Go hit the trails and enjoy our beautiful country.<br/>
 <br/>

P.S. A huge thank you goes out to Rubaduc and Gizz for helping to plant some of these boxes. <br/>

I don't think there will be any gathering when we are out there.  We're<br/>
flying out late on JUL 2 and returning home early on JUL 7.  So we'll have 4<br/>
full days to try to visit as many "states" as we can.  We figured most<br/>
people might be pretty busy with family over the holiday weekend, but if you<br/>
have some time perhaps you could join us on one of the hikes and/or we could<br/>
meet you for dinner one night.<br/>

Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I don't think there will be any gathering when we are out there. We're<br/>
flying out late on JUL 2 and returning home early on JUL 7. So we'll have 4<br/>
full days to try to visit as many "states" as we can. We figured most<br/>
people might be pretty busy with family over the holiday weekend, but if you<br/>
have some time perhaps you could join us on one of the hikes and/or we could<br/>
meet you for dinner one night.<br/>
<br/>

We were so happy to see that all the boxes are on walks of 1+ miles! We are<br/>
<br/>
excited to be heading out your way over the 4th of July weekend and hope to<br/>
<br/>
find as many as possible.... We haven't been in that area of Connecticut<br/>
<br/>
since we attended the famous Mansfield Monster Mash in 2004<br/>
<br/>
(<a href="http://www.chuckstr" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.chuckstr</a> aub.com/Letterbo xing/mmm. htm) and are looking forward<br/>
to<br/>
<br/>
a return visit.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the hard work that you and your helpers put into such an<br/>
<br/>
interesting series!<br/>

~Hello fellow letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
My, do we have a treat for you. An awesome way to spend your Summer.<br/>
<br/>
Did you know that there is some incredible talent all over this great<br/>
<br/>
country of ours? Well, most of us will probably never box in all 50 states,<br/>
<br/>
and D.C., so we have brought them to you.<br/>
<br/>
Some amazing and generous people from all over the country have contributed<br/>
<br/>
boxes for each of our beautiful states as well as D.C.<br/>
<br/>
Some of these boxes are temporary. However, all of them will be in place<br/>
<br/>
starting today, Flag Day and going through the fourth of July, staying in<br/>
<br/>
place through the gathering associated with this series (America Boxes,<br/>
<br/>
which promises to hold more fun, and letterboxes! ) and only a handful of<br/>
<br/>
them will be pulled after 9/11. If you want the complete set, then be sure<br/>
<br/>
to find them in the next three (3) months.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, this is an amazing collection of carvings that you won't want to<br/>
<br/>
miss. Come and see the way letterboxes are done all over the country.<br/>
<br/>
We hope you have a lot of fun with this series.<br/>
<br/>
Please remember to drop a line when recording your finds (if you do so).<br/>
<br/>
That way, the wonderfully generous people that live all over the country<br/>
<br/>
will be part of this awesome adventure also. After all, they are the ones<br/>
<br/>
that made it a reality.<br/>
<br/>
Go hit the trails and enjoy our beautiful country.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S. A huge thank you goes out to Rubaduc and Gizz for helping to plant some<br/>
<br/>
of these boxes.<br/>
