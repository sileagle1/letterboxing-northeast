box placed by Solor&amp;Binx at Joshua's Mountain in Assonet, MA.  The <br/>
clues have changed quite a bit since the box was placed (wooded area, <br/>
downed trees, etc.) and I don't see that anyone has ever listed it as a <br/>
find.  I tried to contact the placer through Letterboxing.org, but no <br/>
response. We would like to plant a box here, but I just want to make <br/>
sure that I don't copy the stamp that they may have used (a profile of <br/>
this mountain).  Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
