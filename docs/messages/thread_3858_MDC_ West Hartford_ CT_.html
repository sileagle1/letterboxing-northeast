                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-337542652">There's a lot of construction going on at the reservoir on Farmington <br/>
Ave. and today I found out that the big parking lot in the back is <br/>
being done away with. The new parking lot will be on the left just you <br/>
drive in but this will change all of the clues for finding boxes at the <br/>
Res.<br/>
When the final move is made, I'll revise my clues to show the change <br/>
and if anyone (from far away) needs to revise theirs, I'll be more than <br/>
happy to help.<br/>
