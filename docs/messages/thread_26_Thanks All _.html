A gathering is being planned and I was reminded about the F500 meet <br/>
at Katie Johns next Saturday . What a great way to start the week . <br/>
Best Monday morning I've had in awhile . Thank you all for coming on <br/>
board for this new list . Thanks to the few who have spread the <br/>
word . It looks to me like things are going to work out just fine . I <br/>
love the idea for a gathering ( I'm sure this surprises nobody ) and <br/>
am looking forward to it , regardless of where , or when it takes <br/>
place .<br/>
<br/>
Again , Thanks All !!<br/>
<br/>
