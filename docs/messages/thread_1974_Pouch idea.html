It's really cool when you find something that works better for you while LBing.  I carry a lot in my backpack and every time I had to put it on, take it off while stamping in - made my back ache.  I notice while hiking with B'fly that she had a nice shoulder bag that holds her stamping stuff.  I went to the army navy store and found a canvas shoulder bag that fits everything so nicely and makes it much easier, like your pouch.  I still wear my backpack, but my stamping supplies are in the shoulder bag.  My back is better and the stamping in goes much faster.  Thanks for sharing.  Maybe someone will benefit from it!<br/>
