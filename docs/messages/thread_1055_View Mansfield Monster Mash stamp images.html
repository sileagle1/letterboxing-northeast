In November, after the boxes are picked up, I will post all the pictures of the stamps on my website. If any of the box makers do not want their stamp on the website, just let me know and those will be left out. I will send an email to all of the people that made boxes. If anyone objects to having their stamp on my website, thats ok, I won't put it on. I do realize the amount of space this will take up on my site but I have no problem doing it. I think it would be great just for boxers to see other peoples style of carving and whats being done by others. For the Mansfield Monster Mash box makers, share your art. Let others at least look at what you have created. Art should not be kept secret. Help promote the hobby and lets get some images online this November......Chuck and Molly<br/>
