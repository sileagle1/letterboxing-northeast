LETTERBOX IN ITS SHORT TIME OUT THERE. UNFORTUNATELY THIS BOX HAS BEEN <br/>
STOLEN AND MOST LIKELY DESTROYED. WE BELIEVE IT TO BE THE WORK OF THE <br/>
LOCAL TEENAGERS THAT HAD BEEN PARTYING IN THE AREA. THEY MIGHT HAVE <br/>
FOUND IT BY CHANCE OR THE LAST BOXER TO STAMP IN MAY NOT HAVE REHIDDEN <br/>
IT WELL ENOUGH. WE WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE IT WAS FOUND BY CHANCE. WHEN <br/>
THE BOX IS REPLACED IT WILL HAVE A NEW HIDDING SPOT IN A COMPLETELY <br/>
DIFFERENT AREA SO LOOK FOR THE NEW CLUES WHEN WE POST IT. THANKS TO <br/>
MARK PEP FOR GIVING US THE HONOR OF THE BOX OF THE WEEK. A REMINDER FOR <br/>
ALL, WHEN YOU FIND A LETTERBOX, PLEASE REHIDE IT VERY WELL SO OTHERS <br/>
CAN ENJOY THE HUNT. THANKS AGAIN<br/>
