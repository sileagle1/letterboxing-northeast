</span></blockquote>Hi Birdstamper,<br/>
<br/>
I check that 'box frequently (I work about 3 mins from there :p), and <br/>
I've noticed a lot of kids sign or stamp in, usually in groups.  I <br/>
figured that someone (scout group or something like the nature center) <br/>
in the area was taking kids out 'boxing.  The 'box has always been in <br/>
good shape with the baggies and 'box well sealed, so I'm not <br/>
concerned.  I think it's a pretty conscientious group, to put <br/>
everything back together properly as they do. <br/>
Actually, I think it's great that he does it!  I hope the kids enjoy <br/>
the different activity, too.  Kudos to your friend.<br/>
