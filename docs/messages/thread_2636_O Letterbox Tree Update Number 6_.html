<br/>
From Route 6 take Station Ave toward South Yarmouth. Turn right at the second set of lights onto Old Townhouse Road. Go to the end and turn left on West Yarmouth Rd. Take the 3rd left (Sheffield) and drive to the end. Turn right, go to the end and turn right again (this is just going around the corner). O Letterbox Tree is located in front of the first house on the right (40 Mockingbird Lane). This is a private residence and a residential area. Please drive slowly as there are always many children on bikes. It is only about a 5 minute drive from the highway. Please do not approach the fence that encloses the backyard. It drives the dogs crazy.<br/>

&gt; The resurrected tree will be available WITH an added Grinch at its new location so please <br/>
head down our way. You'll just get to see a little more of Whoville/Yarmouth and there are <br/>
other letterboxes very nearby the new location. There's no stopping a letterbox tree!<br/>
&gt; Check for the latest clues before you leave.<br/>

&gt;  From: Mary Nelson &lt;cclightningbug@y...&gt; <br/>
&gt;  The deranged bunny is already planned for next year's tree which will have to be <br/>
relocated because the 2 decorated trees at my school were trashed today. They were fine <br/>
late yesterday. We found all the parts (with the exception of 2 small stamps) and are <br/>
reassembling it in my yard and posting new directions for the last week. (I wonder how my <br/>
husband is going to take this, but after 33 years nothing I do can be THAT big of a <br/>
surprise.) I feel the need to add an anti-Grinch present. Oh well, nothing stops <br/>
letterboxers- the tree will live on to the new year!<br/>
&gt;  Happy 2006,<br/>

to the tree! I thought one trip down to the Cape <br/>
&gt;  would be enough but it seems like I'll have to come down weekly!!! I thought of you, <br/>
&gt;  Archemides Screw when I was watching " A Christmas Story". If you do the deranged <br/>
Easter <br/>
&gt;  Bunny, then I'll be at the tree in about 2 hours flat. I hope you all had a great Christmas <br/>
&gt;  and I look forward to the coming year, if you know what I mean!!!!<br/>
