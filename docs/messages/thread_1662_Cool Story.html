start making cards ... or should I say ... making better cards! And I was<br/>
telling the consultant all about letterboxing. Because she wanted to know<br/>
why I was interested in stamping and I had told her I make some of my own<br/>
stamps and why.<br/>
<br/>
Well tonight she stopped by my house to show me her....log book! She went<br/>
out on Sunday with her son and found one of my letterboxes that I had<br/>
placed! It was her first find! It was such a huge honor! And of course she<br/>
is hooked!<br/>
<br/>
She was so amazed at how much fun it was. She said "it's great<br/>
exercise...you're outdoors...you're with family" and she had the biggest<br/>
smile on her face!<br/>
<br/>
Aha! My evil plan is working....I have corrupted another obsessed person!<br/>
&lt;evil laugh&gt;<br/>
