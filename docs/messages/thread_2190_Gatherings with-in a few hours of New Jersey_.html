I have been letterboxing for almost three years and have my fair share<br/>
of finds, and even a few placements, but my exchange and event stamp<br/>
counts (X3E0) are really quite sad for three years of letterboxing! So<br/>
I joined this group with the hopes of righting this wrong. I have never<br/>
been to any kind of letterboxing gathering, but it sounds like a lot of<br/>
fun. Is anyone planning any upcoming gathering in the New Jersey area<br/>
(I don't mind trveling a little)? If not would anyone be interested in<br/>
trying to put one together? I don't mind helping out, but I wouldn't<br/>
want to organize one by myself until I've been to a couple! Look<br/>
forward to hearing from you.<br/>
