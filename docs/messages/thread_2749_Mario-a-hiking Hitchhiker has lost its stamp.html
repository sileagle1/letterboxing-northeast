its stamp was missing.  <br/>
<br/>
It is a small red(?) stamp with a standing-up man on it.  One hand <br/>
has "funny" fingers.  It was last seen when it was stamped <br/>
into "Great Hill..." in Acton, MA.  <br/>
<br/>
If you have visited Great Hill please check in the bottom of your <br/>
backpack, "just in case."  If anyone finds the stamp you can contact <br/>
me, or drop it off at the Ice Scream gathering in Carlisle, MA.<br/>
<br/>
I checked the Great Hill box &amp; the area around it.<br/>
<br/>
This is about the oldest hitchhiker I have seen (3 years), and I <br/>
would like to get it back into circulation.  I removed it from <br/>
Christmas Spirit, pending repair.  A hitchhiker was also removed from <br/>
Christmas Spirit to seed the "Dyslexic Queen" hostel (I had a <br/>
donation credit.).  Christmas Spirit now has 2 hitchhikers in <br/>
residence.<br/>
<br/>
see you at the gathering,<br/>
