So until we get back with the replacement box, enjoy the hike and the view of Fox Island. Or just go to the beach after visiting with Marcus Manlius.<br/>

On a related note, The Pompeii bonus box is also missing. I believe this will be the third rising of Pompeii.<br/>
Hadrian's Wall is still avalable. The clues must be gotten from us.<br/>
If you think you might be traveling these Roman Roads, drop us a line and convince us that you are worthy! :)<br/>
