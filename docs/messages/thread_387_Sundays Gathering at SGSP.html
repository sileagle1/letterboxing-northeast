                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1718333660">The final information for the Sleeping Giant Mini-Gathering is as <br/>
follows.  We will meet at 11:00 in the picnic area with exchanges <br/>
and a nice get together.  At 12:00 the 'Hiking In Connecticut' class <br/>
is going to hit the trail.  Anyone wishing to hike with the class is <br/>
more than welcome to do so.  You might also consider doing some <br/>
letterboxing on your own.  <br/>
<br/>
Our initial goal is make it up to the tower.  We may go "around the <br/>
head of the giant" to get to that trail.  Once we make it up to the <br/>
tower we will find some camelot series and the new tower letterbox. <br/>
We do not have plans for finding The Giants Chin letterbox as it <br/>
takes us up the giants head. However, several other of Jay Drews <br/>
Sleeping Giant Series we will be looking for.  Basically you should <br/>
print all the clues for the giant and do the ones you choose.  We <br/>
hope to make it out the Hezikials Knob.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this information helps out.  If you have any questions feel <br/>
free to email me.  Safe Letterboxing- Letterboxer2002 (Alan)</div>
