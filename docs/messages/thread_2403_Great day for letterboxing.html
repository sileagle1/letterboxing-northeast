Sat.  In good condition, though one was a little damp, were Special<br/>
Snowflake Boston Hollow, Rain/Sleet/Snow, Pixie Falls, This Once was<br/>
Mine, and Donkey as well as a few from Paige's Tales.  Put a<br/>
dessicant bag (is that what it is called?) in Pixie Falls hoping it<br/>
would absorb some of the moisture.  Maybe the next finder can tell if<br/>
it did any good or not. Probably will need a fresh pack by then.  <br/>
