and Deanne have some pretty amazing friends who else<br/>

DID!) and welcome us into their homes and businesses<br/>

also heard those Detectives think Dave and Deanne are<br/>
pretty special, themselves!)  So, THANK YOU for a most<br/>
wonderful time, and please thank "The Detectives",<br/>
TOO!  <br/>
P.S. It was hysterical to pull up to Clousseau's house<br/>
and overhear one of the kids shout, "OK, guys...<br/>
assume positions!!!  <br/>

Inspector Clouseau also prompted his crew - When we arrived, the pink panther told us who she was...as we were stamping in, the inspector pulled his crew aside and said, " You are not supposed to tell them who are you, you need to let them guess!   lol<br/>
