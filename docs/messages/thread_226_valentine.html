                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1224501401">today, Lobsta met Angel and me in Guilford to find a Valentine.  The<br/>
sea gulls are very friendly !! Sadie and Russ , you must have fed them<br/>
well .  We had so much fun stamping in  with such a great stamp,<br/>
laughing as one of us actually stamped the arrow upside down ! This<br/>
time not me as Lobsta carefully handed it to me -twice- pointing to<br/>
the top.  However,  with all the merryment and talking about the<br/>
stamp, I do not believe we wrote in the log book.!! So sorry, as I had<br/>
stuff to write and quite forgot.  If you want a lovely valentine, here<br/>
it is.  So pretty and clever.  Thanks Sadie and Russ , of Twister Fame.<br/>
