<br/>
The Stamp Studio writes:<br/>
In this class, we will learn how to create images, transfer images onto rubber and how to carve those images into useable stamps.  Unlike other "carve your own" classes, we will cover carving techniques like shadowing, shading and texturing.  Great class for Letterboxers!  (Yes, it really does say that!)  Please bring a set of carving tools if you have them, or you may purchase one the day of the class.  $22 for the class.  Stamp Studio's phone is: 860-432-1087<br/>
<br/>
I can tell you that this class is a lot of fun!  At my class, all but ONE person was a letterboxer!  Some of us brought our stamps and were able to exchange with each other before the class!  It was great!<br/>
<br/>
Also, the Stamp Studio has a letterbox in their store, so bring the clues!!!!!  Lastly, if you tell me that you're signed up, and you've never met me, I'll try to stop by to exchange with you :-)<br/>
<br/>
I hope LOTS of you get to the class!<br/>

For those of you who have yet to go, give yourself a treat: GO!  Not only does Mel carry just about anything you can think of stamp related, it's the perfect place to get inspired.  I always leave with a bunch of ideas (and a bag or two of goodies!!)  Enjoy!  MayEve<br/>
