<br/>
Did you get the clues for these boxes from the park ranger?  We were <br/>
there in the middle of the summer.  The park ranger gave me clues to <br/>
the box that is already listed on the letterboxing.org website. When <br/>
I went back to ask for the others, she seemed more interested in her <br/>
phone call than helping the people who were standing there in front <br/>
of her. It was very aggravating.<br/>
<br/>
Did you have any better luck with the ranger?  When were you there?  <br/>
We'd like to go back and try to find the rest if we think we can get <br/>
different the clues from the ranger this time. Thoughts?<br/>

for the other boxes being available in the office, the ranger actually<br/>
in the office had no idea what I was talking about. He did mention<br/>
that the man in charge of the Junior Ranger program (John, who posted<br/>
the clues) was outside with this year's class of Junior Rangers, and<br/>
John provided us with the laminated sheet containing the other clues.<br/>
Most we could not find, and one of the three we did locate we stumbled<br/>
across scattered through the woods. We brought it back with us because<br/>
we had no idea where it was originally hidden, but it was in such bad<br/>
shape that they just tossed it.<br/>
<br/>
While I applaud the Junior Ranger program at this park and wish we had<br/>
something similar in NY, I would not recommend a special trip solely<br/>
to find this series of twelve boxes. I can provide more details to<br/>
potential searchers off-list, but out of respect for the Junior<br/>
Rangers who planted these boxes, that's all I'll say here.<br/>
<br/>
The state park itself, however, is just lovely, and the quarry and<br/>
natural bridge are well worth the visit. The rangers were incredibly<br/>
helpful and even lent me the trail map off the wall when they couldn't<br/>
find a copy for me to take into the woods. If you're near North Adams<br/>
and looking for someplace beautiful to explore, I can't say enough<br/>
about how much we all enjoyed walking the trails and checking out the<br/>
quarry. We fell in love with the Berkshires during our drive (and many<br/>
letterboxing-inspired hikes) across MA, starting with this hike.<br/>
<br/>
If you're looking for other family-friendly letterboxing adventures in<br/>
the area, my kids highly recommend the Scooby Doo and SpongeBob<br/>
series. Great stamps, beautiful hikes - what more could you ask for?<br/>
We're already planning our next road trip back to the area<br/>
specifically to find the many boxes we didn't have time for on this<br/>
particular trip. And if you find yourself driving on Rt. 2 past<br/>
Shelburne Falls as we did, be sure to walk across the Bridge of<br/>
Flowers (a location just screaming for a microbox) and then go eat at<br/>
Cafe Martin. The food was so amazing there that we changed our return<br/>
route just so we could stop in again on the drive home.<br/>
