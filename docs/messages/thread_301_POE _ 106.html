                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1716920596">Well, Warrior Woman, this was an excellent gathering.  I didn't "get out and box" much, but I was OUT, in the fresh air, connecting with new people, seeing lots of old faces...  and eating so much yummy stuff!  It was a breath of fresh air in so many ways, and we were all so obviously ready for it.  Thank you very much, and please thank Farmer Harvey for allowing the use of his property.  Please let Dan and me know when he'll be open again, as shopping was the last thing on my mind yesterday, but we really do want to poke around in the barn.<br/>
<br/>
And for the first time, I stamped my own log book!!!  &lt;LOL!!!&gt;  I simply cannot do more than one thing at a time!!  I knew that if and when I ever did this, it'd be a relief, like the first scratch in a new car...  &lt;VBG&gt;    <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all for coming and making such a fun day, and for bringing the great food.  Thanks to Brian, too, for the two great carvings for the occasion.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I think that you had a first for this gathering.  I met a couple upstairs in the barn who said that they had *just started* boxing, and had been invited to the gathering by attendees they met on the trail.  How nice!!<br/>
<br/>
 I could actually smell spring in the air, I think...<br/>
