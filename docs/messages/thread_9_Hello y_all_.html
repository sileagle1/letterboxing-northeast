<br/>
We recently started letterboxing (August 2003) and LOVE it!  We have <br/>
always been hiking and exploring the wild places in Massachusetts, <br/>
and have found that letterboxing adds so much to our travels through <br/>
the woods.  We have found so many great places that we never would <br/>
have discovered if it weren't for other letterboxers sharing their <br/>
clues with us.  And we have placed a number of boxes in hopes of <br/>
sharing our special places with people like you!<br/>
<br/>
The snow does dampen our letterboxing spirits...(especially because <br/>
Jay placed a special birthday letterbox for Amy to find today on her <br/>
birthday - 12/6 - and now we have to go freeze our butts off to get <br/>
it).  But now we can practice our stamp carving...we've managed a few <br/>
fair stamps, but neither of us has natural artistic talent so we are <br/>
doing our best!<br/>
<br/>
Glad to be a part of this group!  Hope to see you on the trail!!<br/>
<br/>
