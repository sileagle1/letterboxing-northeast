It would have not been the success it was if not for some special <br/>
people:  Bandaid, Brian and and Lori of Team Green Dragon, Donutz716, <br/>
Jumma, Mark and Sue Pepe, Music Woman and RTRW.  They did everything <br/>
from carve and plant, bind, cook, publicize, sell tickets, teach <br/>
carving, donate to the Raffle, set up, clean up, and load cars!  <br/>
You guys are the BEST!  <br/>
<br/>
It was heartwarming to meet some "new" boxers as well as getting re-<br/>
acquainted with those "old" Letterboxers we all know and love so well!<br/>
<br/>
I hope you all had fun!  MayEve<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Thanks to my brother and partner in crime Wild Rover for well, <br/>
everything!</div>
