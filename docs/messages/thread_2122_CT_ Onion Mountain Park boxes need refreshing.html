                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1142484049">I went up to the Onion Mountain Boxes in West Simsbury and boxes 2, 3 and 6 all need refreshing.  Needed are: one logbook (for box #2), lots of paper towels for the stamps and drying out the boxes, and small and large ziplocks (to put both over the boxes and inside).<br/>
<br/>
I've contacted Book Worm concerning this, but don't know if she would be able to get up there anytime soon.  Just in case anyone's going up there....<br/>
