thought the organizers did a fabulous job of handling the 300+ group= <br/>
there was enough food to go around and then some- plenty of boxes to <br/>
hunt etc.  Maybe for some organizers the crowd would have been too <br/>
much to handle- but not for this team.  I have to say that the <br/>
fabulous website probably contributed to the interest of many to <br/>
attend.  The site was so much fun, you just knew the gathering would <br/>
be too.<br/>

 I'm open for any gathering now- big, small or in between! Hope there <br/>
are plenty more.<br/>

I guess I can equate it to weddings I've attended.  I've been to those that have had 150-200 guests and I've attended a 40 guest wedding.  The experience has been totally different, but I've enjoyed each experience.  There were positive aspects to both large and small in their own way.  I had a wonderful time at the MMM gathering and I didn't hear one negative word the whole time.  You can't control how many people will attend an event.  Can you honestly ask how many is too many?

As much as I can relate this to a gathering, our (recent) wedding had<br/>
about 30+ people and that's just about the right amount. If you<br/>
extrapolate that to a gathering, that's just about the right amount too. <br/>
<br/>
(not to mention that anyone who knows me knows... THAT I HATE WEDDINGS...)<br/>

I'm sure it was a fun time had by all, and I know that we missed out<br/>
on some truly wonderful boxes, but I'll pass on the large crowds.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Hey Steve,It was alittle overwhelming and a bit hectic.Not that 350 people that showed up,but making sure that 350 people had a good time and I think for the most part that they did.I see gatherings turning into other things.We play games,we play music we also have people selling things.Who knows where it's going to go from here,maybe a swap meet or maybe even a dance.I heard talk of maybe having a letterboxing Christmas party.All I know is this,since I've started letterboxing I have meet up with the best bunch of people that you could ask for.And yes all the exchanges can be breath taking sometimes.But I really think that it's much more than that.It's a time and place where you can meet up with other people who will except you for who you are, and you will not be judged.So the next time that your standing out in the middle of the woods,you can think back to those big gatherings and say.I feel better knowing that I'm not the only nut chasing after these plastic bowls lol.Lenny</div>

It was like a huge, fun, very well organized family reunion.The only disappointing thing was I wish it could have been longer. I missed out on talking to some that I really wanted to. I always get to touch base with those I need to, I think the angels have something to do with that. I would like to see if the sign-in line could have gone a little faster. Maybe two books or two sign-in stations. But Steve, who could have been left out..... The Bakers dozen with all their stories.....the newbies with all their questions........the kids with their enthusiam....the four legged letterboxers.....I believe everyone that was meant to be there was there. Isn't that the rule of thumb.....leave them wanting for more?  <br/>
From a large family, it was like home.<br/>
Thank you everyone,<br/>

to go anyway.  I don't think all 350 were ever there at the same time so it <br/>
wasn't so overwhelming.  That said, I had a plan before I left home-box first, <br/>
exchange a bit, visit old friends.  That pretty much worked, except I spent over <br/>
2 hours in the pavillion and didn't even notice!  There were many boxers I <br/>
didn't even speak to, not to be rude, but I wanted to get out after some <br/>
monsters.  And I did manage 20+ finds that day.  But that still leaves a lot to find <br/>
before the end of the month.<br/>
I think I prefer smaller gatherings of friends, BUT how do you make new <br/>
friends then?  So, it's hard to say which is 'better'; I guess you just have to <br/>
have a plan and be ready to change it if necessary.<br/>

Both have their place.  I loved the MMM.  It was so well organized <br/>
and so much fun.  The people there were amazing.   Everyone was so <br/>
welcoming.  I look forward to future smaller gatherings too.  The <br/>
fact that there was so much to do and so many boxes supported a <br/>
gathering of this size.  I'm sure other events are geared toward <br/>
smaller numbers and are great too.  It isn't the size that is <br/>
important~ It is how well it is organized.  (I originally used a <br/>
different ending but it sounded dirty.  Didn't want to get blocked <br/>
for inappropriate discussion:)<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts on the matter.<br/>

It was like a huge, fun, very well organized family<br/>
reunion.The only disappointing thing was I wish it<br/>
could have been longer. I missed out on talking to<br/>
some that I really wanted to. I always get to touch<br/>
base with those I need to, I think the angels have<br/>
something to do with that. I would like to see if the<br/>
sign-in line could have gone a little faster. Maybe<br/>
two books or two sign-in stations. But Steve, who<br/>
could have been left out..... The Bakers dozen with<br/>
all their stories.....the newbies with all their<br/>
questions........the kids with their enthusiam....the<br/>
four legged letterboxers.....I believe everyone that<br/>
was meant to be there was there. Isn't that the rule<br/>
of thumb.....leave them wanting for more?  <br/>
From a large family, it was like home.<br/>
Thank you everyone,<br/>

Great comments from everyone.... hopefully this discussion might hold <br/>
weight with someone planning a future gathering! <br/>

On an aside... I think we might be making an appearance on Nov 13th <br/>
at Chatfield! I actually have the day off!!  Its very tough trying to <br/>
get to gatherings when you work 5 on, 3 off!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2013325293">This Mansfield Monster Mash event was terrific.  I had a great time.  <br/>
You guys missed a doozy of an affair.  Chuck and company did a mind-<br/>
boggling job of running this thing.  The boxes came in from all over <br/>
the US, by multitudes of fantastic carvers.  All the clues were <br/>
painfully exact.  The hikes have been amazing.  I wished I lived <br/>
close enough to Mansfield to make it a regular thing.<br/>
<br/>
Before the event, I was nervous about being overwhelmed by the sheer <br/>
volume of exchanges, so my plan was to focus on boxing.  In <br/>
retrospect, I wish I had arrived earlier (perhaps the night before) <br/>
so that I could have boxed first and then spent the better part of <br/>
the day exchanging.  As it was, I barely did any exchanging, but I <br/>
did find over 20 boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
However I did meet many cool letterboxers even if we didn't exchange <br/>
stamp impressions.  There were people from all over the place.  I <br/>
like to actually put a name to a face and have at least a little <br/>
conversation with the people I exchange with.  Hasty exchanges, in <br/>
which people run up to me, ask to exchange, swap sigs, then run off <br/>
to the next person leave me feeling unfulfilled.  So I was very slow, <br/>
but needed to be for my own self-preservation.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I would say that the size of the gathering is <br/>
unimportant.  At the MMM, there were alot of opportunities to <br/>
socialize.  As with most parties, some people work the crowd like <br/>
politicians, some hole up in a corner with their friends and some are <br/>
the wallflowers.  There's room for everyone.  Know yourself and enjoy <br/>
it your way.<br/>
<br/>

PS- Huge thanks to Chuck, Chickabirdie and all the rest who worked so <br/>
hard and made this day go down in letterboxing history.</div>
