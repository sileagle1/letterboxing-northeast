                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-604262762">We spent a lovely labor day boxing.  We hit the 3rd box in the Thames <br/>
Light Series(already had the 1st 2), the Local Islands Series, Pine <br/>
Point School, and Drawbridge.  All were intact and no problems, other <br/>
tahn all being at busy locations.  However, at the drawbridge, <br/>
apparently, you(someone, may be private?) can keep your kayak behind <br/>
where the box is.  While we were busy with the box and congratulating <br/>
ourselves on how slick we were being, considering how busy it was, <br/>
someone went through the other door and ended up washing out his <br/>
kayak right behind the spot for the letterbox.  That was a little <br/>
disconcerting, but not as much as when the water all of a sudden came <br/>
out from underneath while he was washing it and we had the box open <br/>
on the boardwalk!  Everything ended up dry, only the box itself got <br/>
wet, but it was a hoot!  Also, while we were in the middle of it, a <br/>
couple came up to us and asked us to take their picture!!  Then, when <br/>
we were at the Ram Island box of the local island series, a young man <br/>
wrecked his motorcycle not 10 feet from the box(he was fine, but the <br/>
bike, I'm afraid, didn't make it).  At the Block Island box, there <br/>
was a couple parked right in front of the box in camp chairs <br/>
reading!  Ah the joys of boxing on holiday weekends.  <br/>
    Thanks to all the planters- the boxes were wonderful.  It is <br/>
great to have so many boxes in the area.  Boxing with a 7 week old <br/>
baby is indeed a challenge.<br/>

first 2 but when we went to look for the third we could not find "sea <br/>
Fever". After asking around we found out that a scuptlur had just <br/>
been removed. Is it Back?<br/>
Also thanks for the update on the drawbridge and the local islands. <br/>
When we placed these it was raining. I didn't relize how busy all of <br/>
those places were and now i worry about them. Its good to know that <br/>
they are all still alive and well.<br/>

    Congratulations on your new little letterboxer!  When he gets a little older he will realize how lucky he is to have letterboxing parents!!<br/>
