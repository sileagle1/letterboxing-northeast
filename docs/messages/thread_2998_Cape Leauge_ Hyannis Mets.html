Thanks to all who have already visited the Plant An<br/>
Herb Garden in Northwest Park ,in Windsor, Ct.  <br/>
Do to work being done last year, the series had to be<br/>
pulled.  Many letterboxers have asked me to re plant<br/>
them and I have permission once again. I plan to plant<br/>
this Wednesday , if anyone wants to join me in that<br/>
fun, you are welcome.  The Stamps are the same as<br/>
before,  new log books in several boxes, but the<br/>
series will be planted on a different trail.  I will<br/>
also check out the Birds Series as one trail has been<br/>
blazed a different color and has caused some<br/>
confusion.  New clues will be posted for both series.<br/>
Thanks and enjoy , <br/>
