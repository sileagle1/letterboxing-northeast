I really can't add anything great to all the praise for the Caper,  but <br/>
just as a reminder,  no matter how good you are,  a child will up stage <br/>
you !!  Pink 'Panther ' gets my vote.  She did not break character when <br/>
I asked her a question,  she whispered, that she was a Panther and could <br/>
not speak !!  Everyone and everything was perfect.  Big thanks and three <br/>
cheers to you guys,  you know who you are and  we do too.<br/>
good Job all around<br/>
