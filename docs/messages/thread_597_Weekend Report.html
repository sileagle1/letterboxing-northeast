<br/>
Rhode Island:<br/>
<br/>
Trish K does nice letterboxes in great places!  Dingoes at Dinnertime is still there in good shape, as are the Dolphins at Daybreak and its Epilogue.<br/>
<br/>
NCBC is still trooping along in North Kingstown<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We wanted to reach F150 this weekend, since our One Year Letterboxing Anniversary is coming up, so naturally we went to -<br/>
<br/>
Connecticut:<br/>
<br/>
Started the Jumble Series, and got as far as Box #8 before the rain and SLEET hit us.  What's up with that?!?  We'll have to return to buy a vowel.  Neat series, and in good condition.  That's a WHOLE lot more than I can say for the road leading in!  If/when you go, note the sign that says "Road not maintained".  They are very truthful people.  My little Honda was - erm - challenged.<br/>
<br/>
We met a gang of assorted adults and children on the trail.  It was their second day of letterboxing!  They are currently in committee over a name.  'Army of Confusion' was mentioned.  We also ran into Jumping Mouse and Lightning on the trail - a neat run-in with friends from the Winter Gathering in Westborough, MA.  They aren't online, so we gave them the info for the May Day gathering.  Sadly, we're working that day.<br/>
<br/>
We also sometime today found the Connecticut Mystery Wolf LB.  I bumped my bald head on a ceiling, so I need replacing.  The box is fine, though.<br/>
