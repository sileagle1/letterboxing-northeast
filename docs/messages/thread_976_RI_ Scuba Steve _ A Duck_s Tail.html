I visited the Ducks Tail LB when it was first planted and though it was in a highly visible spot and tried to hide it deeper against the tree. While working at an event in the park during May, I checked on the LB and Could not find it.  <br/>
<br/>
I'll be planting one of my Living the Scout Law LB's at Diamond Hill soon and I'll do a better job checking on the Ducks Tail.<br/>
