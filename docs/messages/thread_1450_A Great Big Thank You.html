e-mailed me regarding 'These Monsters Use The Back Door To Coney <br/>
Rock'. I also want to thank the 5 people and 1 4-legged companion <br/>
that helped me on the trails today. Because of your help I was <br/>
finally able to finish the Mansfield Monster Mash series of boxes!!<br/>
I also want to thank the organizers and all of the contributors. This <br/>
has been an incredible couple of weeks. Thank you all. I was able to <br/>
spend so much of this recent beautiful weather on the trails.This <br/>
wraps up my first year of letterboxing with many more to come. It <br/>
just doesn't get any better. Good luck to all of the other monster <br/>
hunters. I hope the weather continues to be kind.<br/>
