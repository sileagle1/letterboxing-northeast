Did anybody see the show about letterboxing on Chronicle tonight (wed. <br/>
sept. 20). It was very good. Did you see the train that man set up in <br/>
the woods? Did anybody catch where it was??? I don't even know if they <br/>
told where it was. I'd sure like to go see it. I think it is somewhere <br/>
in New Hampshire. The man's Last name is Metcalf or Metchaf not sure <br/>
of the spelling.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway -<br/>
I just wondered if anyone saw it?<br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing<br/>

   A dear friend of mine called the other night and told me to turn on Chronicle. She's <br/>
intrigued by letterboxing and I'm bringing her to the Cape gather to get her feet wet. I <br/>
think our first joint traditional box hike should be this one. I've already printed out the <br/>
clues- Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion</div>

evidence to have me committed.  Thinking me even more insane than what he <br/>
thought I was.   Then, he saw the glow in my eyes.   <br/>
<br/>
"Darling, then I could sit, and carve lots of stamps, AND they would serve ME <br/>
3 meals a day and do my laundry!"  I said, with rapture.<br/>
<br/>
He's wondering what would be better, giving up a home cooked dinner and <br/>
dealing with an insane wife who Letterboxes, running through the woods with glee.  <br/>
Or a sane wife and no laundry duty.<br/>
<br/>
Yours might ponder the same!  <br/>
