Thanks so much for planning this wonderful event and all the hard <br/>
work that you put in!  What a successful gathering.  Mobius had a <br/>
terrific time playing with her fellow Dragonfly friend and the <br/>
animals at the farm were a big hit.  The weather was fantastic; <br/>
clearly the letterboxing gods were looking out for us today.  Please <br/>
extend our thanks to Farmer Harvey for his hospitality in providing <br/>
the site and putting up with so many of us.   <br/>
<br/>
Brian, your event stamp was, as usual, fantastic!  You're truely a <br/>
master carver! <br/>
<br/>
It was great to see so many familiar faces and stamps, and to meet so <br/>
many new ones!  Hope to see you all on the trails.<br/>
<br/>
Happy 'Boxing!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Seekyr, Blaze, and Mobius.</div>
