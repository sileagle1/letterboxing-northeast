<br/>
More than a hundred monsters spewed forth from the hellmouth that<br/>
opened it's maw under Mansfield last weekend. A classic, small,<br/>
quaint, New England area of hills and forests and fine old dwellings,<br/>
reduced to fear. Answering the call, hunters from all over,<br/>
descended upon the normally sleepy town and outnumbered the fiends<br/>
four or five to one. Night Owl and I were fortunate to accompany a<br/>
team from the south, of MD/VA hunters. We were led by a<br/>
relentless 'Van Helsing like' hunter of wide renown: Dead Duck<br/>
Chuck.<br/>
<br/>
Arriving at dusk on Friday our team forebore any respite from the<br/>
long journey, swallowed their fear, and plunged into the forest.<br/>
Even the young pixie sprite, Claire de Lune, braved the shadows and<br/>
oncoming dark.<br/>
<br/>
Such monsters to behold! Frankenstein by Team Green Dragon, wrapped<br/>
in black velvet and tied in red ribbon. Werewolves, phantoms,<br/>
vampires. Strange noises in the dark. Hoo Hoo,hoo Woo. "Stop<br/>
that! You're scaring me." "I didn't do it." Twice we were lost in<br/>
the dark in the unfamiliar woods, despairing of our quest. Finally,<br/>
just before the hour of nine, we found our last quarry near the<br/>
mysterious obelisk by the headless cemetery.<br/>
<br/>
"Get what rest you can," advises our Van Helsing, Dead Duck<br/>
Chuck, "we hunt again at dawn." Night Owl burned candle into the<br/>
wee hours mapping out strategy, literally, upon a locally obtained<br/>
atlas. I carved a last minute impression to share with fellow<br/>
hunters at the gather (the Borg Queen, which I afterwards brought <br/>
homeward to start a new tale).<br/>
<br/>
From dawn until into the rainy night, the next day we hunted.  <br/>
<br/>
In the afternoon we paused to exchange hunting art with others of<br/>
our kind, a mad frenzy of four or five hundred fellow hunters.<br/>
(Strangely we met only few of them on the trails.) In the<br/>
disorienting crowd I made only some fifty new exchanges, but that<br/>
without even much trying. Tempus Fugit had the right idea to bring<br/>
camp chairs, park in a quieter corner, and let people come to us.<br/>
The line to stamp in to the event log stretched long for a couple <br/>
hours. Food, music, bingo, trivia contests, raffles -- the hunters <br/>
knew how to gather.  Psychologically disoriented, though <br/>
exhilirated, by crowds, I could barely acknowledge those I was <br/>
anxious to see, or to meet.  More than once I searched through the <br/>
crowd for an impression I had seen in someone else's journal. In the <br/>
course of the afternoon, the other relentless hunters talked me out <br/>
of my more obscure travellers.<br/>
<br/>
Off again, we hunted and hunted on into the dark and rainy night.  <br/>
Our journey here, a 16 hour round trip, we needed to make the most <br/>
of it.  Van Helsing/Dead Duck Chuck often plunged ahead to the next <br/>
hunt while we cleaned up the last. Faithful companion, Tuxie, often <br/>
had to lead us to him.  So determined were we, so driving our Van <br/>
Helsing, that we left Wanda and Pete in our wake as we rushed <br/>
onwards. "Great to see you, gotta run." Through the gorgeous forest <br/>
scene we hunted: towering trees, babbling brooks, little waterfalls, <br/>
little wood bridges, leaves beginning to change, colorful fungus, a <br/>
river of rocks to climb, boulders, and stone walls, stone walls, <br/>
stone walls, stone walls.<br/>
<br/>
We hunted Universal monsters, TV monsters, Munsters, classical<br/>
monsters, screaming monsters, monsters with bad teeth, with one eye,<br/>
too many legs, cartoons, cookie monsters, science fiction wonders,<br/>
and "The Attack of the 50 Foot Woman".<br/>
<br/>
Late that night we found ourselves in a quaint old country store,<br/>
with a quaint proprietess, contemplating a treasure chest containing<br/>
a fabulously wrought Gollum.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, after two nights, a day, and a morning, we had hunted<br/>
down some sixty of the fiends. We left a lot of impressions.<br/>
