  Hi All, We are considering hosting a Gather October 9th to <br/>
  Launch "The Four Directions" tribal series. This gather would be held <br/>
  in the Northwest corner of Ct. We realize this falls the weekend <br/>
  after the greatly anticipated "Monster Mash" gather in Mansfield <br/>
  (which we will be attending!). We also recognize other gathers are <br/>
  planned. Is there interest in a Gather at that time? There is a very <br/>
  large number of boxes in the area and the series will have in excess <br/>
  of 22 boxes ( this series will not be able to be completed in one <br/>
  day). No firm plans are made, and I will post an announcement if the <br/>
  Gather is going to happpen. I bid you all safe trails.<br/>
