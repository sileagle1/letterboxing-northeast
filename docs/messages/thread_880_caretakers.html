</span></blockquote>In this case, I believe that the original placer is still active, just<br/>
not in this area. She knew exactly what part of the clue I was<br/>
referring to when I wrote to suggest a revision after my letterboxing<br/>
partner in crime and I spent probably an hour in the wrong place<br/>
trying to make the rest of the clues work, and I could tell from her<br/>
reply that I wasn't the only finder to have the exact same issue. She<br/>
made it very clear that she knew about the confusion and didn't care,<br/>
so for me it's an ethical dilemma - change the clue against her wishes<br/>
to save other people much frustration, or respect her status as placer<br/>
and keep it as is knowing the clue will lead people astray?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For now I've chosen to respect the wishes of the original placer, but<br/>
it's a very tough choice to abide by. Would it make any difference to<br/>
you if you knew the placer was still active, just not maintaining this<br/>
particular box? Frankly, I'd be happy to be persuaded that it's better<br/>
to protect my fellow searchers in this case than the<br/>
hard-to-understand wishes of one unyielding placer.<br/>
