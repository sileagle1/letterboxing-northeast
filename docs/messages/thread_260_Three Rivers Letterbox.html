Wanted to comment about box #1 on the Heritage Walk in<br/>
Norwich.  We found the box, but it was frozen in the<br/>
ground.  Only had a trowel to dig with so did not<br/>
succeed in removing it.  It was placed in it's<br/>
hidyspot upside down.  If it had been right side up we<br/>
probably could have gotten the lid off and accessed<br/>
the contents.  So we'll just have to try that walk<br/>
again when the ground has thawed. ;-)  If anyone is<br/>
going for that one, take a strong ice pick or ice axe<br/>
or something!  Nice walk anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
In 2 days we found the following in good shape:<br/>
Hurricane, Fish Tale, Happy Musical Note, Jordan Mill,<br/>
Sara's First Birthday, Letter from a Traitor,<br/>
Captain's Walk, Thames River Lights (except for #1),<br/>
Avery Light, Olde Mystic Village, Big Sugar Maple,<br/>
Patriot, Indian and Fountain (except for #1) with #'s<br/>
2-4 in need of attention but didn't have replacement<br/>
books.  Also found 4 of the 6 in the gazebo series. <br/>
No. 1 had only a nickel in the box and #6 seemed to be<br/>
missing. <br/>
<br/>
Great cure for cabin fever!<br/>
