disaster, so I am polling for interest.<br/>
<br/>
I am considering a new HH hostel in N. Billerica, very easy, but winter <br/>
only.  I have two hitchhikers now, so I need to make up my mind in the <br/>
next few days.  The site is ideal for winter, sheltered enough to be <br/>
unaffected by snow.  Ticks during tick season make it a poor site for <br/>
warm weather.  The site would also have a handcarved stamp of it's own, <br/>
and lots of room.<br/>
<br/>
If you are willing to check the clues for this site in the near future <br/>
please email me.  Also, if you are willing to visit the site during <br/>
winter of 2005 - 2006, please let me know.<br/>

Thank you,<br/>
