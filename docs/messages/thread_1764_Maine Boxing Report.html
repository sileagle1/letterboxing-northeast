quick run through the balmy Midcoast this weekend and can report the <br/>
following boxes alive and well:<br/>
<br/>
Mount Battie (with ice -- now that's fun)<br/>
Andre the Seal (more ice -- another 'gleam goes down)<br/>
Wyeth Center (look -- no injuries! The log is full, and the placer <br/>
has been notified)<br/>
Tropical Maine (sure, why not?)<br/>
<br/>
No luck with Spellcaster (the snow didn't help -- neither did the <br/>
point bruise from Battie), and had to save St. George for another <br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
Further south, and reaching back to the dog days of December:<br/>
<br/>
Pettingill Farm (great box!)<br/>
Winslow Park (free in winter!)<br/>
Skipping Christmas (gone but not forgotten!)<br/>
<br/>
Better box now; pretty soon it might get cold.<br/>

<br/>
For the Maine folks on this list....be warned:<br/>
<br/>
Hannaford has LOCK &amp; LOCK plastic locking containers for sale in the .8cup (6oz) <br/>
size.  I used one of these for the Standpipe here in Bangor, and it's held up very well.  <br/>
They're 50 cents each right now, so if you're in Maine and you're desperate for micro-<br/>
boxes (hmmmm....like nobody I know - ha!) then I suggest you check out your supply <br/>
of plastic at Hannaford. They tend to display these on an endcap near the edge of the <br/>
isle.<br/>
<br/>
Go 'Gleams Go!!<br/>
<br/>
Look for some new portland boxes this weekend.<br/>
