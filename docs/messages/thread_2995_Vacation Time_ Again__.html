 It's June vacation time again and Di &amp; I are taking off !! This time, <br/>
we will be going to Wilmington, VT, from the 20th of June to the 25th. <br/>
Of course, we will be searching various databases, for nearby <br/>
letterboxes, but wanted to know if people had suggestions for ones not <br/>
to be missed or, perhaps, not listed in databases.<br/>
 By now, probably everyone is aware, we love letterboxing, but we are <br/>
not very good at it, so we won't want Mystery boxes. We are in it, more <br/>
for the hiking and places that we might not ever see, if we were not <br/>
letterboxing. So, we don't mind remote letterboxes, because we don't <br/>
mind if we go to a beautiful place and never are able to find the <br/>
letterbox....well, we mind, but we are accustomed to, often, not <br/>
finding..<br/>
 Thanks and Keep On Boxing,<br/>
