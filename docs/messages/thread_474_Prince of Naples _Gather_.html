  If it hadn't been so rainy, I would have done The Simpsons, but I'll go <br/>
down another day to finish up!  Thanks especially to the Pepe's for a great <br/>
gather and surprising us with our mystery guest!<br/>
<br/>
After an upsetting stint of being left at a restaurant by myself, after <br/>
trying to have dinner with some boxers after the gather, I did end up <br/>
finding them at the WRONG restaurant (I was at the correct restaurant).  If <br/>
I hadn't walked outside of the correct restaurant and noticed <br/>
TeamGreenDragon's green taurus parked 150 feet down the street in another <br/>
strip mall, I would still be waiting at Captain's Pizza for the other nine <br/>
boxers.<br/>
<br/>
Also, thanks to Rubaduc for the surprise!  Just put a disclaimer on to be <br/>
extra careful when crossing the street!  It may become dangerous and be <br/>
careful of being seen!  (There were A LOT of truckers there.... but I did <br/>
manage it in the dark with a flashlight)<br/>
<br/>
I also got to plant another box in the Time for a Picnic series... if you <br/>
were trying to figure them out!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
<br/>
Music Woman<br/>
(who's now only about five boxes from 1500.... and who would have surpassed <br/>
1500 if she had found The Simpsons today.... sigh!!!)<br/>
