Hi all ...<br/>
<br/>
I'm starting a little project to catalog all of the conservation<br/>
and/or park land in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. My intent in<br/>
undertaking this project is to identify all of the usable, public<br/>
access land where letterboxes could be placed. The directory would<br/>
serve as a sort of idea list for placers as well as a listing of neat<br/>
and interesting places one might enjoy the outdoors, whether it be a<br/>
public park, forest, sanctuary, preserve, or other such conservation land.<br/>
<br/>
I envision a database that includes the following information:<br/>
<br/>
Name of the Conservation Area or Park<br/>
Location (Town)<br/>
Managing Authority<br/>
Acreage<br/>
Whether the land is publicly or privately owned<br/>
Whether the land is open to public use<br/>
Whether the land has established trails<br/>
Other information pertinent to letterboxers (such as restrictions)<br/>
<br/>
Identifying all lands owned by either the federal or state government<br/>
is easy enough, as the majority of this land is public-use parks (e.g.<br/>
Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge operated by the U.S. Fish and<br/>
Wildlife Service or Borderland State Park run by the Department of<br/>
Conservation and Recreation). What is challenging is finding,<br/>
identifying and listing all of the conservation and park land owned by<br/>
one of Massachusetts 300+ towns or countless Land Trusts, Conservation<br/>
Commissions, and other foundations and societies that own or manage<br/>
reserved land.<br/>
<br/>
A preliminary review of association associations (that is, assocations<br/>
to which other associations belong) such as the Land Trust Alliance or<br/>
Massachusetts Land Trust Coalition has yield a listing of 877 parcels<br/>
of land so far -- and I'm certain that there are probably double that<br/>
many once the list is complete.<br/>
<br/>
Given that large number, developing a complete listing is a daunting<br/>
project, but one I still wish to accomplish. So, I seeking help. If a<br/>
couple of us are willing to do a little research to build the<br/>
database, and then I can find a partner who'll help me develop a<br/>
database page within my website, I think the end result would be<br/>
rather useful. Who knows, if the project goes well, perhaps we can<br/>
expand it to the other New England states.<br/>
<br/>

Thanks!<br/>
