all the "junk" being thrown on the big list, a big thank you goes out <br/>
to Ryan for starting this new colony!  <br/>
<br/>
Seeing that many of us know each other already from gatherings, we <br/>
hope this remains a true grassroots kind of list....family oriented, <br/>
fun to be a part of, and relaxed!!!   <br/>
<br/>
We'll likely only be posting here and on the <br/>
TheConnecticutLetterBoxingClub group and going "no-mail" from the <br/>
LBNA list for a while. <br/>
<br/>
Having said that, I'm going to go drink a nice big cup of coffee and <br/>
warm up from all our shoveling!!!!  We're off to by a tree <br/>
today...and I'll be doing a bit of carving while on vacation for the <br/>
next 10 days! Yay!<br/>
<br/>
Graciously!<br/>
