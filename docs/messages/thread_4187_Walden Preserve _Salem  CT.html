The Meadow Flowers are blooming and waiting with up dated clues and relocated <br/>
Bull Thistle <br/>
<br/>
The Syt-u ation  is all tucked in for the winter with new log books .<br/>
The Two Tag alongs  sport updated clues ,because ~ the 'small 'pine trees grew <br/>
!! <br/>
<br/>
We were kissed by butterflies and they are also ready for winter .<br/>
A few other boxes were checked and repairs made .<br/>
We have yet to check the Busy Beaver Box -[ soon ] - the real live beavers have <br/>
been so active , it is a wonder to see . That box might be part of one of the <br/>
beautiful beaver lodges !! <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy <br/>
