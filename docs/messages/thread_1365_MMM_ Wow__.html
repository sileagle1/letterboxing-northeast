                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1060888369">Wow!  I just finished plotting all of the MMM boxes on a map of the <br/>
Town of Mansfield.  Boy, it is ever loaded!<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of perhaps adding the locations of the permanent <br/>
boxes in the area as well, but as there are literally hundreds of <br/>
them, the task was just too daunting.<br/>
<br/>
We were trying to decide whether we should attempt to hunt any <br/>
permanent boxes this weekend.  We realize that while hunting the MMM <br/>
boxes we'll be walking right past some permanent ones, so why not <br/>
stop and get them as well, right?<br/>
<br/>
Well, because if we do, we'll be in the same spot for hours!<br/>
<br/>
So, we've made the decision that we will not go after any permanent <br/>
boxes unless we accidently stumble upon one.  As those boxes will <br/>
continue to be there past October 31, and because we couldn't <br/>
possibly get most of them in addition to the MMM boxes, our focus <br/>
will be solely on the MMM boxes.  We'll be lucky to get even a <br/>
portion of the MMM boxes anyway!<br/>
<br/>
But I'm curious, for those of you going to the MMM tomorrow (or <br/>
rather those going who haven't left yet!):<br/>
<br/>
1.  Will you be hunting only MMM boxes or both MMM and permanent <br/>
boxes?<br/>
2.  How many boxes do you anticipate getting this weekend?  We're <br/>
hoping to take the stamp images from at least 25 boxes this weekend -<br/>
- propelling us over the 100 Found mark! (We're at 80 as of today).<br/>
<br/>
See ya there!<br/>

decided to just do the MMM ones.  But every so often there is a place just <br/>
crying for a box and there just may be one there awaiting you!  It happened to <br/>
me before.<br/>

printed out all the clues for Mansfield, Mansfield Center, and the MMM.  By the <br/>
end of October my goal is to get all the Mansfield Monster Mash boxes, at least. <br/>
 I actually went out today after work and found two MMM boxes and one of <br/>
Chuck's boxes that he wrote into the clue was in the area.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I'm saying is that Mansfield is close enough for me to visit a <br/>
few times this month but far enough away that I really would like to get a lot <br/>
of the regular ones while I'm there to kill two birds with one stone.  Know <br/>
what I mean?<br/>
