<br/>
Let me jog your memory.  November 2004.  Hartford County Connecticut.  <br/>
We had a gathering to commemorate the boxes we planted for the winter.  <br/>
We all put our boxes on LBNA that weekend.  We put so many boxes on the <br/>
site that it CRASHED the site for days!<br/>
<br/>
Have the webmasters thought this through yet?  Since I know nothing <br/>
about website management, can something be done to help ease the huge <br/>
influx of boxes?<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents....<br/>

boxes have been 'warned' they will be posted the night before the <br/>
gather.  That puts so much to do at the last minute,  and print off <br/>
everything sometimes late at night.  [this old butterfly goes to bed <br/>
early !]   Can any of you folks please begin to post durning the day <br/>
before the gather , instead of at night ??<br/>
