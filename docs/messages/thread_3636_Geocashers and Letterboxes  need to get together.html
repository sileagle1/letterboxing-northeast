                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1429191930">Reading NH state park email... comment from Monadnock Manger that he<br/>
has to many geocashes and letterboxes on Monannock..Its a big place tho,<br/>
and very popular......question was put to me ( work part-time NH state<br/>
parks) Because they know i have a lot of boxes in Franconia notch sp.<br/>
I dont geocash, so im not sure where most of the geocashes are located..<br/>
All i do know is we need for both groups to figure how where any group<br/>
has letterboxes or geocashing..people arent happy about having so many<br/>
close together. Most people do not know the difference between<br/>
letterboxing and Geocashing. Beginer geocashers ruin a lot of places<br/>
where letterboxs could be, As soon as a area, park what ever realizes<br/>
that someone is messing up there enviroment, because when you frist<br/>
geocash, it only takes you about 5 feet from location and you have to<br/>
find it, and now your digging things up...people get upset..<br/>
  Anyway answer was i dont know..have not done mondanock boxes..<br/>
In franconia notch i know were all the letterboxs and geocashes are...<br/>
But else where i dont know..<br/>
  Any suggestions on how to fix this, so were not having so many<br/>
geocashs and letterboxes all in one place??</div>

before I plant a box.  I try to stay at least 100 feet away from other <br/>
boxes.  The geocachers stay 500 feet away from each other.<br/>
I only have one instance of my box and a cache within 20 feet.  Both <br/>
clues warn not to confuse the boxes.<br/>
