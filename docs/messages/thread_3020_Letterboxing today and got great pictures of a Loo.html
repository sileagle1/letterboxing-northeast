person taking it has an incredible zoom. The Somes Meynell Wildlife<br/>
Sanctuary on Mount Desert Island also has some regulations in place<br/>
regarding how humans interact with loons in particular.<br/>

would be difficult to get that shot without a zoom. GREAT SHOT!<br/>
<br/>
I saw the same loon when doing that series too. I was shocked when i  <br/>
saw a loon and even more shocked when I stopped and it began swimming  <br/>
towards me. I grew up in Minnesota where the Loon is the state bird  <br/>
and the closest I have EVER been to a LIVE loon is about 100 yards.  <br/>
This loon swam UP TO ME! I thought, "my, NH loons sure are friendly."  <br/>
But be rest assured I did nothing to approach the loon nor try to get  <br/>
it closer (my first thought was, "do Loons get Rabies? Is this just a  <br/>
crazy loon?"). Then my friend saw that the loon was crawling onto its  <br/>
nest. So then we ran away, afraid that we may be on some reality TV  <br/>
show, "When Loons go bad."<br/>
<br/>
The nest was about 10 yards away from the trail, I thought that is  <br/>
one risky place. We'll see how it does.<br/>
<br/>
Glad all are so understanding of the delicacy of the loon.<br/>
<br/>
The other incredible thing was the plethora of Pink Lady Slippers in  <br/>
bloom! Another endangered species I believe. The Pink Lady Slipper  <br/>
Orchid is the Minnesota State Flower and I have NEVER seen one  <br/>
before. Well, they were all over the place at this park. Those flower  <br/>
lovers will have to go in Mid June next year to see the flower in  <br/>
bloom. Amazing!<br/>
