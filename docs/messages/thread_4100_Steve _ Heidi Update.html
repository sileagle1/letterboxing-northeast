Mom and baby are doing well.... as am I and the big brother (who's 4 now!). In other good news, Heidi told me this week that she misses LB and wants to get out this spring and do some hiking.... so we hope to see all of our friends (both new and old) on the trail.  <br/>

And with every bit of good news lies some bad news: We regret to announce that we had to put Madras to sleep this past week. She was 12 years old and I'm sure many on this list will remember meeting her at gatherings and on the trail. She's missed dearly and leaves a large hole in our hearts. I think we will continue to use our stamp that i carved with her image on it as a fitting tribute to our "1st child". <br/>
