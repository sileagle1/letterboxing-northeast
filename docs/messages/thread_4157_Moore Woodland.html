I was letterboxing at the Beebe Pond Park in Mystic today and I came across <br/>
 the Moore Woodland letterbox. It had two logbooks and no stamp. I did not <br/>
find  it on the letterboxing website or in the archives. Anyone ever hear of <br/>
this  box? <br/>

That helped alot.  I found the clues for Parallel Play in the LBNA Basement.  Unfortunately, I wouldn't count this as a find for me because the stamp was missing but we were curious to found out who it belong to.  Thanks again and take care,<br/>
