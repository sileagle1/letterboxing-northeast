letterboxing walk at the Walden Preserve in Salem on Saturday June <br/>
9th at 10am. This is not a Gathering, but should be lots of fun for <br/>
anyone who would like to go. I recommend bringing a small ($5-10) <br/>
donation to the land trust if you come, as we are trying to raise <br/>
funds to purchase a new preserve. <br/>
<br/>
Lots of wonderful letterboxes nearby if you work just a little to <br/>
find the clues ;)<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there, Jay &amp; Margaret<br/>
