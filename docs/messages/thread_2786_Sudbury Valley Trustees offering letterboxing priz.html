Trustees (SVT), a land trust that owns and protects conservation land<br/>
along the Sudbury, Assabet and Concrd Rivers, actively promotes public<br/>
use of their land and has placed "official" SVT letterboxes on its<br/>
property.<br/>
<br/>
They are now offering a prize (they don't say what) for finding at<br/>
least half of the 10 official SVT boxes placed on their property.<br/>
<br/>
They call it the "Letterboxing Challenge" and it will run through<br/>
August 31 of this year.  Simply find the boxes, collect one of the<br/>
green SVT medallions inside and, when you have 5, go to the SVT office<br/>
in Sudbury to collect your prize.<br/>
<br/>

Figures that I've already found many of the SVT boxes, but there are<br/>
still a few to go.  Just went after "See-Der Pine Cones" yesterday,<br/>
and once again I can highly recommend the SVT boxes ... they are all<br/>
EXCELLENT hikes and great finds!!<br/>
