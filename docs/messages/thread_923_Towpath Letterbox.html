                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-731542648">Was notified that the trail to the Towpath Letterbox in Fisher<br/>
Meadows had been blocked off.  Went to check it and, sure enough, it<br/>
was.  I scouted out the other access points and all were blocked by<br/>
orange mesh. There seems to be some form of construction going on -<br/>
perhaps something to do with a new water supply.  Since there was no<br/>
one around today, I probably could have by-passed the mesh and<br/>
reached my box if I had had the time.  We'll be on vacation for the<br/>
next 3 Sundays and will check the status of things when we return. <br/>
Engraver's boxes in Fisher Meadows seem to be OK except a couple of<br/>
them are additionally concealed by vines and some brambles which<br/>
might add some challenge to the hunt.  Things certainly look<br/>
different in mid-summer than in the spring. <br/>
