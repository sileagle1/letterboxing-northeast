while walking over Connecticut trails that closely resemble Siberia!  <br/>
<br/>
It was especially nice to be able to walk Madras this afternoon <br/>
without needing a jacket. Its amazing how warm 45 feels!  <br/>
<br/>
One a side note... all you lb-combo-cachers could walk ACROSS a <br/>
certain lake to pick up a certain Drew-cache these days.  Hint Hint. <br/>

Have no fear....soon it will be 90, muggy, thunderstorms, and we'll <br/>
all be thinking of how nice winter is. Personally I'd rather put on <br/>
layers and drink cocoa.....instead of sweating water as quick as I <br/>
can drink it! (-S)</div>
