had a nice vacation for two weeks in my kitchen, but I'm glad that it's where <br/>
it belongs!<br/>
<br/>
I tried to contact the Lovers but haven't heard from them.  If anyone could <br/>
tell me if they know how to get in touch with them, that would be great.  I'd <br/>
like to update them and get the original logbook to them!<br/>
