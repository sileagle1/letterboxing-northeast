Elizabeth this weekend. I can't say for sure if that will be today (Saturday) or Sunday, <br/>
but it will be pulled by Monday.<br/>
<br/>
I hope at least some of you Maine folks had a chance to enjoy this series. Look for <br/>
Isosceles' Decemberween to be placed in a different spot, and more southern Maine <br/>
boxes in the future!<br/>
