I am SO DELIGHTED for you!  To have something go missing is sad, but <br/>
to have it suddenly reappear is PRICELESS!<br/>
<br/>
I know that sometimes geocachers get a bad rap, but I have a <br/>
letterbox in RI that is only a few degrees away from the GPS of a <br/>
geocache.  The owner of the geocache and I take turns doing <br/>
maintenance on each others treasures!<br/>
<br/>
I'm doing the happy dance for ya!<br/>

Just an FYI - Songbird's boxes are very close to my boxes in that <br/>
area.  You could really do a boxing "marathon" within a 5 mile area <br/>
if you do Songbird's boxes and my boxes at the same time - since you <br/>
will be coming out this way anyway.  In fact, in one case, Songbird <br/>
and I each have a box within mere steps of each other (Firsts and <br/>
Marathon).<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>

I'm free 8 am to 2 pm on any Monday-Thursday.  That's when my three <br/>
children are in school.  I tend not to box in MA because there's no <br/>
one to play with during the day during the week.  I box my brains out <br/>
in RI on the weekends because I have hiking partners there.<br/>

Bostonrott - you got a new boxing partner!<br/>
<br/>
And I'm good with children.<br/>
<br/>
And I come with references.<br/>
