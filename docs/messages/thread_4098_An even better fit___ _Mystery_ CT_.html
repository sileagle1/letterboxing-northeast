It seems the trail clearing work has begun in some parts of the state during the middle of Winter. While out walking the pups yesterday, my husband and I were amazed at the clearing going on at this particular mystery location.<br/>
 <br/>
We tried to find the correct tree, but it had been cut down and chipped. We found the remnants of the box-baggies, plastic, paper towels etc. Then we noticed the log book had been stuck in the crook of another tree. <br/>
 <br/>
We were about to give up on the stamp when our letterboxing dog, with a nose for all things plastic and rubber, came across it. Thanks Doodles!!!**<br/>
 <br/>
This box has been retired. <br/>
