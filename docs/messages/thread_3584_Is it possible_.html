books are full of previous finders.... what do they think that is about?<br/>
And duh, what about the next person who looks up the clues to find it..it<br/>
would have to be an extremely dense person to think they should be<br/>
collecting all these boxes and taking them home.<br/>
<br/>
I have an idea.  Perhaps the webmasters/owners of lb.org could take a look<br/>
at the hits on the pages of the missing boxes.  Try to find the common<br/>
computer that viewed them all (probably one after another).  I bet it would<br/>
be a pretty clear trail.  And, if they were lucky, they could even trace it<br/>
to someone's log in.<br/>

  Geesh! I go away on vacation and come back to chaos! After discussing this<br/>
missing box problem with Antiboxer2, he thoughts are that perhaps this is<br/>
someone who doesn't know the concept of letterboxing and doesn't realize<br/>

they are supposed to take the boxes. I would just hate to see angry<br/>
