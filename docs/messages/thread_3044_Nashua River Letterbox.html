that like "Sasha's Buddy"--there will be some goodies for those of you <br/>

Horrary for my first adoption! L'sister will just love swiming in the <br/>

new log book &amp; markers--I took the old one out as it was wet--hence <br/>
the reason I put in a new LOCK &amp; LOCK box. I may adjust the clues a <br/>
bit as Sasha &amp; I wandered around and around looking for no avail for <br/>
one of the clues--we found a very nice boat with boats no marker.  If <br/>
anyone ever hears from WES--let him know the box was adopted by me--<br/>
