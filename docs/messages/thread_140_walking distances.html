I got Topo for Christmas.  I love maps.  Now if I could only figure out how <br/>
it works.  I'm a technochallenged mapophile.<br/>
<br/>
I like to find out how far my LB hikes are going to be ahead of time.  Most <br/>
of the time I have to be back for the school bus or whatever.  I have a pretty <br/>
descent map book of all the state management areas in RI.  I got it at the <br/>
headquarters of DEM at The Great Swamp.  They also have individual maps available <br/>
for all the areas.<br/>
North South Trail has a book out (I forgot the name and it's in the car in my <br/>
LB bag)<br/>
And when all else fails there's always Ken Webers Walks and Rambles in RI.  <br/>
I've been trying to get More Walks and Rambles but maybe it's out of print, <br/>
because I can't find it anywhere but the library.<br/>
<br/>
Boy it's getting cold out there.<br/>
<br/>
On on,<br/>
