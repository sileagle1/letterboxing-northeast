I believe that all of the boxes in Salem are on Atlasquest. There are some nearby boxes that are not. Off the top of my head:<br/>
<br/>
Marblehead Rail Trail - Marblehead, MA - Bill and Craig<br/>
Breakheart Reservation - Saugus, MA - Bill and Craig<br/>
<br/>
There are also a few new ones in Beverly, MA that are only on LBNA. I don't recall the planters trailname. Beverly is just across the river.<br/>

<br/>
All my boxes are on Atlas Quest, those are the ones in Salem. If you  <br/>
have a boat that you can use, or you are a kayaker, than you can get  <br/>
the Misery Island box. . . but that's not my box and I haven't gotten  <br/>
that one yet because I don't have a boat and I don't have the  <br/>
clues. . . I could swim I guess but that deep water freaks me  <br/>
out. . . plus I might get run over by a jetskier. . .  or swallowed  <br/>
by a whale . . . or my ultimate fear that my mother ingrained in me  <br/>
when i was young (probably she just mentioned it once to keep me out  <br/>
of the water yet I still vividly remember) are the GIANT CRABS!!!!  <br/>
I've never seen one myself, but my mom says they PULL YOU UNDER!!!!!  <br/>
AAAAHHHHHGGGHH<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, I believe that is all the one's in Salem. Please note that  <br/>
Pickman/Jackson has been pulled and is sitting right here next to me.  <br/>
I have yet to replant that one.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy Salem, and if you have some questions, please feel free to  <br/>
email me directly.<br/>
