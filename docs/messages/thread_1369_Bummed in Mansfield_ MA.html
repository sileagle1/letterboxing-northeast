weather coming for it too!  Wish I we were going but my husband felt <br/>
we should get more stamps "under our belt" before attending (we're <br/>
newbies..P5 F8 ).  <br/>
 <br/>
Will be thinking of everyone tomorrow as we start our trek out for <br/>
the day..letterboxing begins at 6AM sharp!  Well..first stop is the <br/>
breakfast diner..got to load up on those carbs before starting <br/>
out..will need all the energy I can get, as I forgot the life support <br/>
last week, and nearly expired hiking up an abandoned STEEP ski slope -<br/>
 in the name of letterboxing..guess it was better than the rendezvous <br/>
we interrupted at one park..<br/>
 <br/>
But that's another story...<br/>
<br/>
Godspeed everyone!<br/>

We're on the south coast, and it's five hours to my Uncle's house near the Bangor airport, going about 65 on the highways (traffic permitting), since The Widening.  Now, my aunts in Madawaska are a different story...<br/>
