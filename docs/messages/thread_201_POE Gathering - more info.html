gathering in another state on the same day as the POE gathering.  My <br/>
response below, plus additional info on the POE gathering:<br/>

I haven't requested any, since just about all the traveling event<br/>
stamps I have ever seen I have seen multiple times at the last three<br/>
New England Gatherings.<br/>
<br/>
There will be an Event Stamp, carved by Brian of Team Green Dragon,<br/>
a "Post Event" Stamp, if anyone wishes to carve one (the name of the<br/>
restaurant is "Tweeds" if anyone needs inspiration ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Also, at the POE Event in MA, I will be harboring a hitchhiker hostel<br/>
rather than having hitchhikers all over the stamping tables which<br/>
takes up much time. Anyone who has a hitchhiker in their possession<br/>
can bring it to the event, stamp the Event stamp into it, and place<br/>
it in the hostel. For every one hitchhiker you place into the<br/>
hostel, you may take one out and bring it with you on your travels.<br/>
<br/>
And don't forget to bring something for the potluck luncheon table.<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least - bring clue sheets for the area letterboxes! I<br/>
have just recently placed an additional six this past weekend (clues<br/>
to be forthcoming next week).<br/>

Thank you for all of your work expended to make this gathering happen, as well as the additional letterboxes you have planted. You are a perfect example of what makes this pastime so enjoyable!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
