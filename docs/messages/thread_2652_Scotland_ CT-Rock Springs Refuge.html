found "Tennessee State Stamp", "In Search of the Black Dog of Bungay" <br/>
and "Pine Alley". All the boxes were in fine shape and well worth the <br/>
hunt.  None had been visited since Dec. '04! If you have not been to <br/>
this refuge, it offers fine hiking and other boxes are located in the <br/>
park and close by.<br/>
