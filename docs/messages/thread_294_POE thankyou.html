                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1597158622">Greetings to all! Thanks Warrior Woman for such a great job with <br/>
the gathering!! The Harvey farm was a fabulous choice! Please extend <br/>
thanks to farmer Harvey. Brian, we are thrilled with the wonderful <br/>
event stamp. It is a classic!<br/>
   We are very happy to have placed names with faces and are thrilled <br/>
with meeting so many of you. Our kids had a grand time and we left <br/>
with the 3 year old crying that he did not want to leave! (He also <br/>
did not want to nap). We ended the day with finding "Angel's lookout" <br/>
and headed home. So sorry we could not make the dinner. Regards to <br/>
all and Safe trails!<br/>
