bad as we thought it would be, but we couldn't find the Misery box- <br/>
anyone know if it's there??  We looked and looked all over the area, <br/>
but had no luck. We didn't find anything that would fit the bill <br/>
of "half Moon" as described in the clues, so maybe we were just not <br/>
looking in the right spot? The D.E.P. box is alive and well.  We also <br/>
did Father's Day Flowers.  The logbook is full, but in good shape.  <br/>
From there we went to start Drewclan's Green Falls series with a side <br/>
trip to Mystery Falls.  We couldn't find that either!! HRUMPH.  With <br/>
the humidity at 110%, we were dragging, so we decided to come back to <br/>
finish the pond series on a cooler day- have two boxes left. What a <br/>
pretty area!! Hope all are well-Happy Boxing!!! Sunshine, Swamp <br/>

there last month!<br/>
<br/>
As for Misery, we couldn't find it either.  I know it was pulled last year <br/>
for maintenance.... did it ever get back?<br/>
<br/>
If you ever get back there...  there's an unpublished box on the way up ;-)<br/>
