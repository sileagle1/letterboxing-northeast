Tamath Rossi Qualifies for Public Financing<br/>
Money, Message and Momentum Might Just Beat Joe Crisco <br/>
<br/>
Naugatuck Deputy Mayor Tamath K. Rossi, who is running for State Senate in Connecticut�s 17th District, today submitted her application for public campaign financing.  <br/>
<br/>
Tamath announced her candidacy September 8th, and in just three weeks raised a total of $16,612 from 486 donors.  As a result, the Rossi for Senate campaign will be awarded a grant worth $85,000 when the State Elections Enforcement Commission certifies their application.  That means she will have a budget of $100,000 to communicate with voters between now and Election Day, November 4th.<br/>
<br/>
Under new campaign finance laws, a candidate for state Senate must raise at least $15,000 and receive donations from 300 district residents in order to qualify for public financing.<br/>
<br/>
Today�s news gives Tamath a significant fundraising advantage over 16-year incumbent Joe Crisco, who violated election law and was summarily disqualified from public financing earlier this summer. <br/>
<br/>
On July 2, 2008, the State Elections Enforcement Commission rejected with prejudice a forged application seeking $85,000 in taxpayer funded campaign dollars filed by Senator Joe Crisco�s candidate committee.  In his rush to qualify, Senator Crisco could not wait for his campaign treasurer to return from out of state, and so ordered the treasurer�s secretary to forge the signature of her boss on a sworn and notarized affidavit.  <br/>
<br/>
When it became apparent that the signatures did not match, the SEEC confronted the Senator, who admitted his part in the criminal deception.  'I wasn't thinking when I had her sign it. ... I thought it was all right,' explained Crisco to the Connecticut Post.  Apparently, the State�s Attorney�s office did not agree with the forgery being �all right� and has expressed interest in further investigation.  Crisco 2008 remains thus far the only campaign committee denied public funds by the SEEC since the inception of the program.<br/>
