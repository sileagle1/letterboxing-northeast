                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-580157635">While out finding a series today, we happened on another box by accident.  It was one stamp and a logbook but in the logbook,. there were a total of 4 stamps stamped.  The logbook names the series "Things You Might See While on a Spring Walk" and listed letterboxing.org as a reference.  I can't find the clues anywhere.  Does anyone know who planted this and where the clues for the other 3 stamps are?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
