</span></blockquote>It is only due to time and energy invested by placers <br/>
in placing boxes that you, as a finder get to enjoy <br/>
this hobby at all. The hair that is being split here <br/>
is not about whether a clue seems obvious (which it <br/>
should, since you read "drive by" before you read the <br/>
clue itself), but rather that the placer is the one <br/>
who is providing your little treasure hunt for the day, <br/>
hour or minute. The game is prepared in a certain way, <br/>
and whatever that may be is decided by the placer. <br/>
Finders and others only show disrespect for the effort <br/>
that the placers have exerted by EXTENDING the clues <br/>
in a variety of ways, such as by publishing WATERED <br/>
DOWN INTERPRETATIONS. <br/>
<br/>
I think we established with the previous database <br/>
discussions that placers CANNOT STOP others from <br/>
watering down their clues. But others should realize <br/>
that by performing this watering down, drip by drip <br/>
they start to erode the intrigue of this game and <br/>
remove any incentive for some placers to provide <br/>
interesting material.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-61242606">Since my "tag" of "driveby" started this thread, let me just explain:<br/>
<br/>
This webpage for I-95 boxes started as a suggestion from many letterboxers in preparation for the summer vacation traveling season. My "driveby" tagline was my interpretation of the length of time needed to find this box so that a traveler could budget their time most effectively. At no time did I mean any disrespect to any placer by the "driveby" tag. My intent was to list those letterboxes that were close to the highway and easy/quick to find. <br/>
<br/>
I apologize if anyone was offended. I have not only removed the State of Maine box from the list, but I have also removed the "driveby" tag line - even if it is used in the clue. I have replaced "driveby" with "quick."<br/>
<br/>
I am taking the time to respond so as to put this issue to rest. We want to keep this smaller list free of the flame wars we have seen on the national list. I will be more careful in the future and have even emailed Alan [Letterboxer2002] to ask his permission to place his mystery "911" clue in CT without the town name.<br/>
<br/>
It was my excitement &amp; love for this game that might have clouded my judgement - but at no time did I mean any disrespect to any letterboxer. That was the last thing on my mind!<br/>
<br/>
I hope that we can ALL put this behind us.<br/>
Mia culpa, mia culpa.<br/>
