<br/>
I am sorry to send this out to both lists but I wanted to make<br/>
sure it went to everyone. I am thinking of having a Monster Mash<br/>
in 2007 if there is enough interest. I am going to do it a<br/>
little different then the last time. Here is what I want to do.<br/>
<br/>
1. Only ONE letterbox per person will be allowed this time.There<br/>
is a limit of the first 75 letterboxes.<br/>
2. The only way that the letterboxes will be returned is if<br/>
return postage is sent with the letterbox.<br/>
3. All letterboxes must be railroad themed. Because you will<br/>
find out way later if there is enough interest.<br/>
4. I NEED LOCAL HELP WITH THE GATHERING IN OCT .<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
<br/>

&gt;Paul, I'm alittle confused about how you said you were going to run this MMM different than the last time.I don't know how you can even connect your self to the last one.If my memory serves me right,the only contact that you had with the 2004 MMM is that you parked the cars.Please do not take credit for something that you had nothing to do with.Lenny (NeeDeeps) </span></blockquote></div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-898543813">Lenny and all:  I don't think Paul meant it to sound like he was <br/>
connected to the  2004 MMM.  I think he was just stating that he <br/>
wanted something different than the last one.  Perhaps he could have <br/>
worded it differently.  I think you read a little too much into it.<br/>
<br/>
As for the name... yes I think it should have another name, since <br/>
this won't be monster themed.  OK, so it will be in October.  That's <br/>
fine, but it should be called something that has to do with trains.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure anything can compete with the 2004 MMM.  That was just <br/>
massive!  Perhaps on a slightly smaller scale, Paul?  And what town <br/>
would you hold it in?  If you are thinking Putnam... that's really <br/>
far away ;-)  Can you make it closer?  Like, Glastonbury?  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
OK, perhaps I'm being a little selfish there ;-)<br/>
