The Mystery Bridge, Cilleyville and Kenniston were already MIA.  Blair Bridge (original log book missing, kindly replaced by a visitor) and Squam Bridge were picked up/retired today.  Tannery Hill will most likely be retired on Monday.  We thank all of you who visited the bridges and sent us comments.  The clues will be updated to reflect that they have been retired.  It may be Monday before that happens.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again and happy boxing.<br/>

<br/>
I hope that all of you have been have a terrific summer! In spite of the<br/>
ticks, mosquitos, and poison ivy I'm sure all of us have tried to make the<br/>
most of the great weather by playing in the woods. Even though I learned<br/>
about the sport/hobby/pastime/addiction of letterboxing from a student of<br/>
mine years ago, I still feel the excitement that comes from turning over a<br/>
stone and finding treasures. Little did I know during my first quest (a<br/>
dismal rainy October) that my life would never be the same again! I quickly<br/>
fell in love with the creativity, mystery, and thrill of accomplishment that<br/>
comes with this fantastic activity. Now I am getting ready to take part in a<br/>
new opportunity, one that will allow me to live in and explore another<br/>
region of the world. Though I am very excited about the adventures I will be<br/>
experiencing, I'll miss family and friends. I know that whatever directions<br/>
my life's path takes, when I eventually return I'll be able to pick things<br/>
up where I<br/>
left off. I will surely miss the weekly adventures into the unknown and the<br/>
kind, creative people I've met over the years. You are all amazing! Until<br/>
then I wish everyone good health, happiness, and continued enjoyment with<br/>
letterboxing. Take care...and spread the word!<br/>

I was sorry to hear that Chickabirdie was hospitalized.  I hope that she is feeling better each day.  My thoughts continue to be with you both.  As far as my "leave of absence" from letterboxing, please don't worry.  The Fulbright Teacher Exchange Program lasts for 1 school year.  I'll be back by early-mid August of 2007.  I can only imagine the catching up I'll need to do by then...so many new adventures and creative boxes.   <br/>
peace to you both!<br/>

I quickly fell in love with the creativity, mystery, and thrill of accomplishment that comes with this fantastic activity. Now I am getting ready to take part in a new opportunity, one that will allow me to live in and explore another region of the world. Though I am very excited about the adventures I will be experiencing, I'll miss family and friends. I know that whatever directions my life's path takes, when I eventually<br/>
  return I'll be able to pick things up where I<br/>
 left off. I will surely miss the weekly adventures into the unknown and the kind, creative people I've met over the years. You are all amazing! Until then I wish everyone good health, happiness, and continued enjoyment with letterboxing. Take care...and spread the word!<br/>
 Peace, friendship, and inky hands,<br/>
