<br/>
My boxing as of late has included hand-sewn felt pouches for my<br/>
stamps. Not only do they protect the stamps from the elements, but it<br/>
has tied in nicely with my hand-made logbook covers for a complete theme.<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone interested in a quick demo on how to make an easy felt cover<br/>
for your stamps? I will provide some amount of felt and supplies but<br/>
I'd like to put this idea out there if anyone is interested to get an<br/>
idea.<br/>
<br/>
On average it takes less than 10 minutes to sew the edges with a<br/>
simple stich and the supplies are very simple:<br/>
<br/>
1) Piece of felt cut to size for stamp<br/>
2) needle and thread<br/>
3) button or string<br/>
and scissors<br/>
<br/>
If anyone thinks they might be interested I'd be willing to do a 30<br/>
minute demonstration on how to do this. If not, I'll still bring a few<br/>
samples of ones that I have made recently and you may certainly ask me<br/>
personally.  Please respond to phyto underscore me at yahoo dot com.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
