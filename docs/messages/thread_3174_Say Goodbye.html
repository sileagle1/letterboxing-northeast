I like to think that God is watching Toad Dog and all the other dogs that have passed away until we all can meet again someday. Maybe he's playing with our Molly. He's in a place with no pain and time is meaningless. A place with all good things. God will take care of him until you are together again someday...Chuck, Chickabirdie, and Amy<br/>

             I Loved You Best<br/>
<br/>
   So this is where we part, My Friend, <br/>
   and you'll run on, around the bend,<br/>
   gone from sight, but not from mind, <br/>
   new pleasures there you'll surely find. <br/>
<br/>
   I will go on, I'll find the strength, <br/>
   life measures quality, not its length.<br/>
   One long embrace before you leave, <br/>
   share one last look, before I grieve. <br/>
<br/>
   There are others, that much is true,<br/>
   but they be they, and they aren't you. <br/>
   And I, fair, impartial, or so I thought, <br/>
   will remember well all you've taught. <br/>
<br/>
   Your place I'll hold, you will be missed,<br/>
   the fur I stroked, the nose I kissed. <br/>
   And as you journey to your final rest, <br/>
   take with you this...I loved you best. <br/>

I stumbled across Toad Dog's picture a couple of days ago that you sent me of him rescuing that letterbox.  Unfortunately, the Box Rescuer box went missing, but I still have his photo on my computer.  It now makes me cry, but I know he's in a better place.<br/>
