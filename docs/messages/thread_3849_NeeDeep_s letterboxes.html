  That is wonderful that you have stepped up to save some of these terrific gems of letterboxing history.<br/>
<br/>
  Do you have a list of which boxes they are? Now that they are in your name it is a lot harder to figure out which ones are which <br/>
<br/>
  I "think" there are only a handful of New London county ones. I am willing to adopt those if it helps you out.  Just let me know.<br/>

Thanks for stepping up to adopt these boxes.  That's how I got <br/>
started before I planted.  I would take some over for you, but I <br/>
don't see any in Hartford county.  <br/>

Although I've never met Lenny, I am sorry to hear he is leaving the<br/>
hobby.  I've enjoyed finding a few of the 'boxes he planted.  Kentucky<br/>
State Stamp and Frog Rock were my F1 and F2 'boxes!<br/>

  It would be so good to have a list of Lenny's boxes and  we could help by choosing ones we feel able to care for .  .  Lenny was a great letterboxing buddy , we boxed the day away many times .  He even rescued my walking stick , more than once.  I would enjoy helping  anyway I can . His boxes are treasures , with so much thought put into the box and where it was placed .  <br/>
  Please keep us posted , and thanks Chuck <br/>

&gt; &gt; That is wonderful that you have stepped up to save some of <br/>
these <br/>
&gt; terrific gems of letterboxing history.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Do you have a list of which boxes they are? Now that they are <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; your name it is a lot harder to figure out which ones are which <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I "think" there are only a handful of New London county ones. <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; am willing to adopt those if it helps you out. Just let me know.<br/>

&gt; &gt; About a week ago Lenny of The NeeDeeps came over for a visit. <br/>
One <br/>
&gt; of the subjects that we talked about was letterboxing. It turns <br/>
out <br/>
&gt; that he is not going to be letterboxing anymore and he turned all <br/>
his <br/>
&gt; boxes over to me for adoption. Most of the boxes haven't been <br/>
&gt; maintained or clues updated for a few years. I have started to <br/>
check <br/>
&gt; on them already but with checking the adopted boxes, my own boxes <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; looking for new boxes, it's going to take some time. I will <br/>
probably <br/>
&gt; be putting some of the boxes up for adoption to other boxers.This <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; discussed with Lenny and he's ok with that. As I put some of the <br/>
&gt; NeeDeep boxes up for readoption, I hope some of you volunteer to <br/>
help <br/>
&gt; keep some of these historic boxes alive.....Chuck &amp; Amy<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-137838671">Thanks everyone for the offers to pitch in and adopt The NeeDeep's boxes  I'll be posting a list of available ones on LBNE. He had about 80 boxes listed. I know that there were no boxes in Hartford, Litchfield or Fairfield counties.  I'll take the boxes that would be best for me, and post everything else. Volunteers can then contact me to adopt what they want. Anything left over I will also keep, no problem. I took on the responsibility of adopting the boxes thinking that I may be doing them all anyway so every box adopted by another person is one less than I expected. The NeeDeeps were good friends and great letterboxers. It will be great to have the boxes up and running again. Keep in mind that the boxes will almost certainly need maintainence. I've already found that some needed clue adjustments. Trails, houses, posts were painted different colors. New trails have been made. Landmarks such as trees, standing and across the trail are gone<br/>
 etc. Some of these boxes are 6 years old so they are going to need some tlc to get them back in shape. Some may even be missing and no longer exist. I guess we just retire those and put the clues in the archives. Will try to get that list together soon.....Chuck and Amy ._,___ <br/>

You are, as you know, saving a piece of CT boxing history from extinction.<br/>
I still remember the excitement as the "quarters" boxes started appearing for the different states.<br/>
