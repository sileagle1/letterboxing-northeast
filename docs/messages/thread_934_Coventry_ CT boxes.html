in CT for boxes. Anyway, we were able to find most of them, but some <br/>
were too elusive for us. We could not find The Mary Lemist Titcomb <br/>
box behind the library, the third box of When I was a Girl in the <br/>
Martin in the Nathan Hale Cemetery, or the second box of The Women of <br/>
the Revolutionary War. If anyone has any info on any of these boxes, <br/>
please pass it on. We did find the other boxes in these series plus <br/>
the CT State Stamp, which is in pieces (I will let the NeeDeeps <br/>
know), Lake Wangumbaug, Pumped Up, Mousing in Laidlaw Park, <br/>
Constitution State, Coventry Grammar School, Charter Oak's Great-<br/>
Grandson, G.H.R., and Uncle Sam's Nephew. All were in good shape <br/>
except the CT stamp. Thanks to all who placed all of these great <br/>
boxes for us to find on this beautiful summer day! Hope others who <br/>
were also looking had a fruitful day. <br/>

If you happen to be in Provincetown and go to get the Race Point Lighthouse box please remember to leave yourself plenty of time and water. We looked at the lighthouse and thought that it didn't look that far. We went totally unprepared, no sun lotion, flip-flops and NO WATER!!!! 3 1/2 hours latter I had to ask someone for a ride back to my car. WE DID GET THE STAMP! Unless you are driving please know that it's a good hike and go prepared!!<br/>

And yes, be careful going out to Race Point in Provincetown.  Darrin and I <br/>
went out there with just Darrin's water and he ended up drinking it all on me, <br/>
and I didn't have any!<br/>

I don't think I will be venturing out to Provincetown this trip. We will be staying in the Falmouth area, so I will be concentrating in the Dennis-Yarmouth Port area. I don't like to travel to Provincetown during the summer months because of all the traffic. But thanks for the info about Race Point. I will keep it in mind for the future.<br/>
