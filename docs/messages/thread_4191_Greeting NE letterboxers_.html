My partner, Lighthouse Keeper (LK) and I have recently moved to Keene, NH from the Great Lakes Letterboxing region. We've been boxing for a couple of years now and are excited be in what is known back in Wisconsin as the "Letterboxing Mecca". :) Unfortunately, we haven't gotten nearly as much boxing done as we'd like to. I've started a PhD program at Antioch University, which leaves me little time for adventures, and LK works all the way out in Manchester (which leaves little time for her to adventure as well!) Alas... we miss the days when boxing was a weekly event. <br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I just wanted to say hello to our new letterboxing community. LK and I would love to meet some of you sometime soon. Maybe in January we could do a meet and greet? We'd be happy to go somewhere more central too... doesn't necessarily have to be in Keene. Anyone have any ideas? <br/>
<br/>
Also, while I know this is really early to say, LK and I will be hosting our very first letterboxing event on Columbus day weekend, 2013. It will be in celebration of our wedding. :) More details to come, I'm sure... but we just wanted to throw it out there right away. Letterboxing is what has brought us together. We owe a lot to the hobby and to all of the wonderful journeys it has taken us on. We'd be so honored if some of our local NE community would come and share in our celebration during the event. Still, we know Columbus day weekend gets real busy out here, so we wanted to announce it early on. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We hope everyone has had a wonderful holiday so far and send happy new year's greetings your way as well. Looking forward to getting to know you, your boxes, and the wonderful territory that is New England. <br/>

Love and oneness,<br/>

We have a bunch of friends from the Great Lakes group and we know you are all pretty active - especially your talk list. This list has quieted down over the years. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We hope to meet you soon. You are in a great location in southern NH - close to all the New England states. Sue &amp; I held our annual Bed &amp; Boxing event in Rindge, NH and left a series there permanently called "Hiking Essentials." Hope you get a chance to get to that one - the area is very nice and we hope to be there again next fall for Bed &amp; Boxing. <br/>

There's a number of boxes in RI that are nice - what parts of the state are you visiting?  (Oddly enough, one can travel quite a awhile on backroads and still be in Rhode Island.  Who knew?)  If the weather is poor, there are many library boxes, as well.<br/>

  &gt; to. I've started a PhD program at Antioch University, which leaves me<br/>
  &gt; little time for adventures, and LK works all the way out in Manchester<br/>
  &gt; (which leaves little time for her to adventure as well!) Alas... we miss<br/>
  &gt; the days when boxing was a weekly event.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; At any rate, I just wanted to say hello to our new letterboxing<br/>
  &gt; community. LK and I would love to meet some of you sometime soon. Maybe in<br/>
  &gt; January we could do a meet and greet? We'd be happy to go somewhere more<br/>
  &gt; central too... doesn't necessarily have to be in Keene. Anyone have any<br/>
  &gt; ideas?<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Also, while I know this is really early to say, LK and I will be hosting<br/>
  &gt; our very first letterboxing event on Columbus day weekend, 2013. It will be<br/>
  &gt; in celebration of our wedding. :) More details to come, I'm sure... but we<br/>
  &gt; just wanted to throw it out there right away. Letterboxing is what has<br/>
  &gt; brought us together. We owe a lot to the hobby and to all of the wonderful<br/>
  &gt; journeys it has taken us on. We'd be so honored if some of our local NE<br/>
  &gt; community would come and share in our celebration during the event. Still,<br/>
  &gt; we know Columbus day weekend gets real busy out here, so we wanted to<br/>
  &gt; announce it early on.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; We hope everyone has had a wonderful holiday so far and send happy new<br/>
  &gt; year's greetings your way as well. Looking forward to getting to know you,<br/>
  &gt; your boxes, and the wonderful territory that is New England.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Love and oneness,<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; OLJ and LK<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
