such a success! Thanks to those who organized it, ran it, box makers, and <br/>
especially Chuck Straub who placed over 125 boxes that were sent for this <br/>
gathering from all over the country! Thank you for giving all of us a great <br/>
day of letterboxing!!!<br/>
<br/>
Eternally grateful,<br/>

P.S.~ Does anyone know who made that great broccolli, sunflower seed, and <br/>
raisin casserole??? My mom is dying for the recipe!<br/>
