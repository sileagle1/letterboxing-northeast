won't be able to go to any gatherings in the northeast anytime soon--<br/>
but the whole "Maine or Massachusetts" location seems kind of silly.  <br/>
The two areas are so far apart--a good four weeks on foot, I'd say--<br/>
it would be beneficial for gatherings in both places.  A MA gathering <br/>
might prevent Mainers from visiting, while a ME gathering might not <br/>
allow a lot of those from CT, MA, RI, etc. to visit.<br/>
<br/>
And if all gatherings were created solely on majority rule, every <br/>
gathering will always be in the same place.  Most people will vote <br/>
for whatever location is closest to them, and CT is infamous for <br/>
their large boxer population.  Throw in all those adjacent states, <br/>
and no other states would ever have a chance of hosting an event--<br/>
especially at the farthest off distances such as Maine.<br/>
<br/>
So, my vote is for a gathering in both locations.  =)  Preferably on <br/>
different dates, though, so people can go to both gatherings if time <br/>
and energy permit.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Unfortuantely, I'm even farther off the beaten path than Maine, and <br/>
shall not be able to attend either event.  But, I'll do my best to <br/>
make a Portland, Oregon, gathering that Funhog suggested.  ;o)<br/>
