I will try to keep it out a few days longer as it took a little longer to get out this month. The original box had gone missing and the creator was kind enough to send a replacement.<br/>
 <br/>
As a plus, there is a bonus this month. Be sure to look for the clues.<br/>
 <br/>
They are both wonderful creations, by Shorty and mudflinginfools. You will not want to miss these.<br/>
