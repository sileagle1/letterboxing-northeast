 I went to find a geo cache yesterday and thought<br/>
about how great a spot it was to put a box. The GPS<br/>
unit had me going around so much that I knew that no<br/>
box was safe by this hill side. Common sense should<br/>
usually rule. I will most likely go to the other side<br/>
of the trail and say turn around and take a look at<br/>
the hill.<br/>

All letterbox placers need to be aware of geocaches.<br/>
Its that simple and complex.<br/>
