you're my hero!<br/>
<br/>
Pezpam just posted about the boxes along the Waushaum Ponds Rail<br/>
Trail, all of which I found with Brandy You're a Fine Girl, Tony &amp;<br/>
Veronica, and the Pointer Party ... that little 3-mile round trip took<br/>
us more than a couple of hours and it was well after dark before we<br/>
finally claimed the last box.  As reported, all were in fine shape,<br/>
including Bill &amp; Craig's Waushaum Ponds Rail Trail box, also on the<br/>
same trail.<br/>
<br/>
Also happy to report the launch of It's Tiki Time HH by the Pointer<br/>
Party in one of the boxes along that trail ... presumably on it's way<br/>
to another box now!<br/>
<br/>
All-in-all, I recorded 60 finds -- including 31 Caper boxes, 26 other<br/>
published boxes and hitchhikers, 3 mystery boxes, and 1 personal<br/>
traveller.  A single day record that launched my PFX count over 500<br/>
and placed me within 69 boxes of F500 ... a mark I intend to reach by<br/>
October's end!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to all ... especially the event's organizers and the five<br/>
'boxers who stuck with me on our hunt in Sterling!<br/>
