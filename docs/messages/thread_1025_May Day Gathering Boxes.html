Also, I went to the Wickford LB 2 days ago and found a HitchHiker <br/>
there...unfortunately, there's no title.  On the bag it says <br/>
<br/>
'6-30-04<br/>
Hitchhiker<br/>
by: Faye Lauren + Gammy'<br/>
<br/>
It was left at the READ LB in Bristol, RI on 7-2-04.  Picked up by <br/>
Cool Librarian &amp; WaldenRun on 7-14-04, and they dropped it off at the <br/>
Wickford LB on 7/17/04, and I picked it up on 7/21/04...<br/>
<br/>
...does anyone know how to get in touch with Faye Lauren or Gammy? <br/>
This is a new HH and I'm the 3rd person to find it...</div>
