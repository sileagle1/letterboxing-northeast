<br/>
It was a great time Sunday in Lebanon for this event!  It was disappointing that Chrissy couldn't be there.  Music Woman took over the event without a blink of an eye and moved us along to mostly all of the boxes scheduled for the day.  The sun was shining, spirits were bright, the event stamp was wonderful - who could ask for more?  Flutterby and Fat Cat welcomed us into their home with a nice cozy wood stove fire to warm our chilled hands and feet.  Thanks to Queen Bee for responding to an emergency call for a Castle piece.  I enjoyed being with a great group of people who all share in a common passion of boxing.   <br/>
