and Bald Eagle for all their hard work to plan, setup and host the <br/>
May Day Gathering!!!! It was even more fun than last year! Terrific <br/>
job!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
We thoroughly enjoyed the hikes that were combined with the <br/>
scavenger hunt and the mystery surrounding the location of the <br/>
gathering. It was also great to see familiar faces and new ones too!!<br/>
<br/>
For us personally, the timing and location of this event <br/>
(Mashamoquet State Park) could have not been more perfect. You see, <br/>
some 19 years ago this month, my husband, Jeff, and I went for a <br/>
hike in the park. During our hike, had me stop. He proped me up on a <br/>
boulder, got down on his knee and proposed to me. Yesterday, at the <br/>
gathering, 19 years later, we visited the boulder.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for a very memorable day!<br/>
<br/>
Wendy and Jeff Sabourin<br/>
