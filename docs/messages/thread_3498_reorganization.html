It's been along time since my last post.  I recently went to check on a mystery box of mine the other day and realized that only 1 pair of letterboxers had found this box.  I thought I had posted it once before, but I guess i didn't.  I just wanted to see if anyone out there still can go outside the box and really work out a clue.  I remember the feeling of solving difficult mystery clues and being the first person to find  the box and stamp in.  This is one of my favorite clues and thought some of you would appreciate it.  Good luck.  The next to find will get a bonus clue.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Seth<br/>

How about telling us what state you planted your mystery in ?? and the <br/>
name of the mystery - or is all that the mystery ??  Ct boxes love <br/>
mysteries and it is hard to think you have not had any other 'usual <br/>
suspect' sign in .<br/>

The name of the clue is lohengrin.  Look around the lbne site and you should find it.  It's in New England somewhere.  Remember where I'm from?  Good luck.<br/>
