<br/>
Granted I drive a gas-guzzling Expedition, and some would argue <br/>
leaving letterboxes in nature is littering, however we try to make an <br/>
effort to bring an extra plastic wal-mart bag on the trails with us <br/>
and pick up litter here and there as we go! <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the day and have a nice week/weekend boxing! <br/>

As Mark would say, get out there and box!</div>
