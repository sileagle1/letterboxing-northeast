<br/>
Although, do we know his Mom is not monitoring him?  she could be sitting right next to him while he types... one never knows do one?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;.. I was a bit surprised when I learned hikerlou was XX years old... I'd rather him roaming around on this relatively benign board  ... but it only takes one bad egg to make such a meeting not worth it.  I'm not really inclined to ban Hikerlou completely, though.  The talk list itself is a fairly safe place to chat online...but I like to think we could educate him...  And I'd rather welcome Hikerlou into the letterboxing fold than turn him away and have him find some other hobby to join that <br/>
</span></blockquote>may not be as caring or concerned about his well-being.<br/>
