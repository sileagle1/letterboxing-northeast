Today I spent my 1st anniversary of letterboxing hiking in southern <br/>
Massachusetts, what else; letterboxing with my daughter Talia and our <br/>
dogs Oak and Grady. Our first stop was Happy Birthday Baby LB. at a <br/>
nice park in Walpole.  The box was full of water but the journal &amp; <br/>
stamp were dry. After drying it out the box in fine.<br/>
<br/>
Next we stopped at the Water Series in F. Gilbert State Forest, <br/>
Foxboro, Mass. all three boxes our fine and the Water Drop Letterbox <br/>
is Ice Free now. While stamping in at the Water Lilly Letterbox we <br/>
found the Rambler Hitchhiker resting. He'll be continuing on his <br/>
rambling ways soon.<br/>
<br/>
From the Turtle Clan we would like to wish  Jay a Happy 28th Birthday <br/>
and a long life in letterboxing.<br/>
