Some of you may know me. I have been on the usa group a few times <br/>
but I need a smaller, more local place to belong to. I am slowly <br/>
trying to place some urban boxes in nyc. I placed two, though one is <br/>
missing and I need to check on it. Have one more ready and have <br/>
asked permission to place another one. It's slow going. Urban boxes <br/>
are a unique undertaking and can be time consuming, researching <br/>
places to place them, checking the places out, etc. <br/>
I was at the Palmyra gathering in NJ, my first one. It was great! <br/>
Everyone was really nice. LetterboxingBee did a great job. I'll be <br/>
at daspirit222's gathering in Medina and hope to meet some of you <br/>
there. <br/>

put them in files by state, and we stopped whenever possible.  We <br/>
spent an entire day in Houston, half a day in Tucson, and several <br/>
days throughout Florida before heading north.  Our find count jumped <br/>
from 164 to over 220 on our journey.  Now that we are in deeply <br/>
frozen New Hampshire, and the Grumpy half of our team is working <br/>
during the week, our find count is slowing.  I have hopes for the <br/>
weekends, however.  Just have to figure out which boxes are <br/>
realistically available in the snow and ice.<br/>

rediscovering the area through letterboxing.  In the 8 months we've <br/>
been there we have gone to so many parks and nature preserves that <br/>
we never previously knew existed!  Now we get to experience New <br/>
England from the same new perspective.  I am amazed that there are <br/>
letterboxes just down the street from where we used to live in <br/>
Peterborough --- and we never knew! The snow and ice might keep us <br/>
from finding them this month, but we'll be back again in August.  <br/>
