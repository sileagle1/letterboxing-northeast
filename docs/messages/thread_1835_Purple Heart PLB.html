<br/>
A brand new PLB box, called The BooBoo Box, is packed and ready to<br/>
go! This PLB replaces The Purple Heart PLB which has gone missing in<br/>
action. Jude of Team Freckles and I have just done the finishing<br/>
touches, so you will receive it soon. Since this is a brand new box,<br/>
BOTH of you should stamp into it and share your stories!<br/>
<br/>
Check Mark Pepe's website for more information about The BooBoo Box.<br/>
<br/>
p.s. to Mark - put them on the list!!!<br/>

<br/>
I am just begining some spring cleaning and want to update some clues, <br/>
fix, clean, and replace some boxes.  I recieved word over the winter <br/>
that the Purple Heart letterbox was replaced with the Boo-Boo Box by <br/>
Warrior Woman.  I am glad the tradition still carries on.  However, it <br/>
seems The Purple Heart Letterbox has gone missing.  I was hoping it <br/>
might be shipped back to me if it ever turns up.  I would really like <br/>
the stamp and to be able to read the book.<br/>
<br/>
Thanx and Safe Letterboxing-<br/>
