afternoon at Potowomut and are preparing for the event.  Chief Taccomanan <br/>
cannot attend and the insect zoo has long since gone but we will find much <br/>
to share when we meet.<br/>
<br/>
A gifted craftsman from Connecticut has agreed to etch rubber for all to <br/>
make an impression of the event.  Travellers of a personal nature will find <br/>
welcome in the shelter but roving ones should be left in the wild, without a <br/>
hitch.  The phantom phiddler has already provided direction for treasure <br/>
seeking.  Look to the web and the event for more.<br/>
<br/>
You are invited to bring the fruits of your harvest (and vegetables, too) to <br/>
share with others.  Provide your own drink but, fear not, you will not have <br/>
to eat with your fingers as the white man's utensils will be provided.<br/>
<br/>
I bid you a safe journey and wait anxiously until we can all be united.<br/>
<br/>
Tom Noone<br/>
