published/not missing/not mystery boxes, plus their bonuses. I also <br/>
met up with 2 different groups of young families who were new <br/>
letterboxers, while stamping into "In Respect of Christopher Reeve". <br/>
I explained about exchanges and bonuses.  Speaking of bonuses, found <br/>
Travel Bug h.h. at Mr. Reeve's box. What a day:-)<br/>
  catlover/teacher/gardener<br/>
<br/>
  "Eagle Eyes"- needs new logbook but added more index cards along <br/>
with cards still in box so it is set for now. Lots of visiters!<br/>
  "Red Hat"- a total mess with soaked logbook I am drying out.  Box <br/>
must be leaking. Put in new logbook (double-bagged) and wrapped the <br/>
box in  a plastic bag. Will contact placer.<br/>
  "Doors of Durin"- fine! found bonus before box. <br/>
"In Search of Mad Gasser"-fine!<br/>
  "In Respect of Christopher Reeve" (plus bonus)-fine!<br/>
"Thomas Carrier"-not too well hidden from all sides and stamp pad a <br/>
tad mushy-cute first stamp.<br/>
  "Pushing up Daisies-3"- fine!<br/>
"Banner of Rohan" and bonus-fine! dusk descending at this point..<br/>
 "Old Methodist Church" found in the dark and stamped in upside-down <br/>
in my logbook. The microbox logbook is totally full.</div>
