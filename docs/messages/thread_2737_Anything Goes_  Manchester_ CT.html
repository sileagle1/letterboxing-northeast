April 6 to go see Anything Goes at Cheney Hall.  This is the same theatre <br/>
company that put on Once Upon a Mattress that I was in with the May Day Lillies.  <br/>
They're in this one (I had to sit this one out :/) and they've made a box for <br/>
it.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Tickets on April 6 are reduced to $15.  Anyone in?  Drop me an email.  I'm <br/>
sure it'll be a great show.  They've got a great team!<br/>
