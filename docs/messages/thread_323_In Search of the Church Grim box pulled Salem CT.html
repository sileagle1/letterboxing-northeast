that I remove the "In Search of the Church Grim" letterbox from it's <br/>
hiding place in the cemetery. I went down there today and took out the <br/>
box. It is no longer there. There are now no boxes in that cemetery. I <br/>
will make another "In Search of the Church Grim " letterbox at a later <br/>
date. It will be in an entirely new location, not that cemetery,with a <br/>
new stamp, new log book. The old log book and stamp will be retired. <br/>
