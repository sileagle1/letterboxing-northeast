logbook about seeing prints and pointed out the bark stripped trees <br/>
to me. (nope, no pond nearby--were'nt the work of oversized <br/>
beavers).I have seen the scat/urine marking spot of a bobcat after <br/>
folling the tracks in the snow.  Cats are one of the few creatures in <br/>
the world who leave a set of 2 prints v.s. 4. Hindfeet place <br/>
themselves in forefeet prints.  Lions and tigers and bears-oh my!!<br/>
