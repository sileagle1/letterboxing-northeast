                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-206990272">We started this series yesterday.  There are 21 boxes.  We had to drive almost an hour to get there.  We didn't find the first box.  The clues are hosted on a personal websirte so it doesn't say if they have been found or when and I wasn't given the option to contact the placer.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we found the second so we kept going.  The clues were well written and the boxes are close together which kept the kids' attention.  We spent a lot of time on boxes 9 and 10 but never found them.  We stopped after finding box 14, Strega Nona, because it was getting dark.  We went on Sunday because there is not supposed to be hunting in the State forests on Sunday but we could hear a lot of shots.  Happily, the boxes are all fairly close to a main trail, a few just a little way off it.  We found out later there is a shooting range nearby so maybe it wasn't hunters, only target practice.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is a great series.  We had read most of the books but not all and my kids want to read the ones they haven't.<br/>
<br/>
We want to go back before it snows to continue from Strega Nona and find the last 7 boxes.<br/>

<br/>
I was delighted to participate in this series with my contribution <br/>
of "Goodnight Moon".  Did you, by chance, find it?<br/>
<br/>
I am always curious about the boxes that I contribute to letterbox <br/>
series because I usually do not hear or see hide nor hair of them once <br/>
I mail them off (like Journey into Imagination and The Four Directions).<br/>

We did find Goodnight Moon.  It was exactly where is was supposed to <br/>
be.  All the boxes we found were in good shape.  I replaced a few paper <br/>
towels and ziploc bags but the boxes themselves were all ok and the <br/>
logbooks were all dry.<br/>

landmarks have changed because of some tree cutting, etc.  I'm thinking of the <br/>
Secret Garden box and some others right around it.  So keep your eyes wide <br/>
open!  Specifically, I remember that the tree with four blazes mentioned in the <br/>
clues has been cut down...  stuff like that.  But I did those boxes last <br/>
spring and they were all still there.<br/>

The area it is in have had a huge number of trees cut (a whole large patch) so I'm guessing they are gone.  Glad though that we're not the only ones!  We really want to find those last few to finish up.  Hopefully the weather holds out and we can get out before hard winter sets in<br/>
