just tucked way into a cravass under the capstone. Did you do the <br/>
cute Circle of Life series at Merrow? Also, Friendly Skies? I believe <br/>
you did say you found Last Day. Thanks for calling this local park to <br/>
mind-I should go for a hike there some time soon.<br/>

guess Simba was found floating down the river somewhere. I did not <br/>
print out the clues for Callie to find because the clues indicated <br/>
that new stamps were being made and will be hidden soon. We did end <br/>
up finding Timon yesterday anyway. I just happened to remember where <br/>
it was, so Callie got a find. Unfortunately, I did not know about <br/>
Friendly Skies at the time. Just another reason to go back! Thanks <br/>
for the input about the Merrow Park box. Maybe I will bring a <br/>
flashlight with me next time, and peek into the dark corners of the <br/>
cap stone. <br/>
