                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-838361373">Hello fellow boxers.  Just a reminder that there's only 3 weeks left <br/>
to get the 8 boxes you need to figure out where the gather is to be <br/>
held.  Check the clue page on LBNA for updates on time and exact <br/>
location spot. Several people have offered to carve and plant boxes <br/>
and we have a few in the works, as well.  Sooooo, there should be <br/>
plenty of new boxing to do!<br/>
This will be the usual potluck affair with some items supplied by the <br/>
hosts. There is NO electricity at the pavilion in question, so <br/>
crockpots won't be a good idea.  We will have a grill going, though. <br/>
Stay tuned!!!  Feel free to send me an email with questions or <br/>
suggestions, and don't forget to send an email when you have the <br/>
location figured out. We'd like an idea on how many plan on attending.<br/>
