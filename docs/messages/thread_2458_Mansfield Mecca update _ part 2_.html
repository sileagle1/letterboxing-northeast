<br/>
   In continuing with our check up of Leader of the Pack's boxes , I <br/>
see that she has 10 boxes outside of Ct. I am asking the main NOrth <br/>
East group if they would be willing to check up on the condition of <br/>
these boxes ...new baggies , new logbooks, stamp conditions.  LOTP <br/>
will not be able to visit these areas in the near future. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Oceanwytch who will be checking on the Kittery box<br/>
<br/>
Any one for the 4 New Hampshire Boxes   2 in Rye ( great time to <br/>
check them  no tourists ) and 2 in Newcastle <br/>
<br/>
Any one for the 1 box in Vermont ? There is a fee for this one . UVM <br/>
MOrgan FArm.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone for the Mass boxes ? 1 in Harwich and 1 in Mansfield Mass.<br/>
<br/>
Any one for NEW YORK   Sherburne and HAmilton <br/>
<br/>
If these boxes are indeed missing , we might ask the group if anyone <br/>
has the images and look for people to recarve them.<br/>

Thank you <br/>

Hello North Easters <br/>
<br/>
   In continuing with our check up of Leader of the Pack's boxes , I <br/>
see that she has 10 boxes outside of Ct. I am asking the main NOrth <br/>
East group if they would be willing to check up on the condition of <br/>
these boxes ...new baggies , new logbooks, stamp conditions.  LOTP <br/>
will not be able to visit these areas in the near future. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Oceanwytch who will be checking on the Kittery box<br/>
<br/>
Any one for the 4 New Hampshire Boxes   2 in Rye ( great time to <br/>
check them  no tourists ) and 2 in Newcastle <br/>
<br/>
Any one for the 1 box in Vermont ? There is a fee for this one . UVM <br/>
MOrgan FArm.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone for the Mass boxes ? 1 in Harwich and 1 in Mansfield Mass.<br/>
<br/>
Any one for NEW YORK   Sherburne and HAmilton <br/>
<br/>
If these boxes are indeed missing , we might ask the group if anyone <br/>
has the images and look for people to recarve them.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you <br/>
