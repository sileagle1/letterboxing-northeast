Today I trekked out with my wife Sheila and Grateful Dawg to visit a <br/>
couple of sites.  The first area was to Sins of the Flesh at Fort <br/>
Barton, Tiverton, RI. The hiking was great; we found a great <br/>
waterfall running though a small gorge and great views of the bay <br/>
from the fort.  We couldn't find the 1st letterbox but the other two <br/>
are fine. We'll have to try again another time for no. 1.<br/>
<br/>
We then traveled over to Bristol and the Read Letterbox. Which had <br/>
several books for trade and a nice view of the bay. After that a <br/>
visit to Aden's for a Guinness and a early St Patrick's meal of corn <br/>
beef and cabbage to finish off the weekend.<br/>

After finding Mushroom &amp; Broken Heart of the Favorite Ornaments <br/>
Series the day before the POE Gathering, Pigtographer and I headed <br/>
back to Burlingame State Park to finish out the series.<br/>
<br/>
We finally found the Cuckoo Clock!  As well as the rest of the <br/>
series, except for 'Stocking'...we knew we had the right place <br/>
according to the clues, but no Stocking Stuffer for us.<br/>
<br/>
Halfway through the series we stopped to get Sadie's &amp; <br/>
Russ's 'Camping At Burlingame' LB.<br/>
<br/>
Even though it was rather cold in the woods today - the ticks are out <br/>
and a movin'!  I found a deer tick crawling up the leg of my jeans <br/>
and hastily flicked it off. (I found it when we found the Gingerbread <br/>
Man - so I'm thinking it hitched on when I was looking for Pickle.)<br/>
<br/>
After having lunch, we drove to Jamestown to look for the N.E.S.S. <br/>
Series - it seems that not many people have been out to look for <br/>
those!  Those were a lot of fun and a very creative idea.  We found <br/>
all three with ease.<br/>
<br/>
On our way back, we made a pit stop at the von der Insels' Rhode <br/>
Island Directions Mystery LB - Pigtographer hadn't found it, but I <br/>
found it last summer.  Anyways, no one had visited that box since <br/>
November 2003, so we cleaned it up - wrapped the stamp in a new paper <br/>
towel and put it in a new plastic baggie - there was a lot of <br/>
condensation within the LB.  Wiped out the container as well, and the <br/>
logbook.  We rehid it carefully!<br/>
<br/>
We had a great time today and picked up some great stamps - thanks to <br/>
everyone who continues to plant LBs!!! (We really liked the <br/>
letterbook idea - maybe we could extend it to another library...)</div>

I'm so glad you enjoy the stuff!  I'm probably going to move the Rhode Island Directions to higher ground.  It is a bitsy damp by a swamp.<br/>

(checks log book)<br/>
<br/>
On January 1, 2004, I went in search of this series.  At the time, it <br/>
had been noted that both "Christmas Tree" and "Stocking" were MIA.<br/>
<br/>
I found Mushroom, Cuckoo Clock, Broken Heart, Pickle, Gingerbread <br/>
Man, Kindergarten Keepsakes, and then half heartedly went into the <br/>
Christmas Tree area, knowing that several were missing.  That area <br/>
was so intriguing (to me) to poke about that I ended up off trail <br/>
nearly a half mile away deeper into the woods.  Much to my surprise, <br/>
sitting out in the open, getting a little sun, was the Christmas Tree <br/>
letterbox that had gone missing in June 2003.<br/>
<br/>
I rushed back to the correct area, put Christmas Tree back into its <br/>
place (after stamping in, of course!), then put in an earnest search <br/>
for the rest of the series.  I found Gold Star and Candy Cane and <br/>
then got completely stumped by Stocking.  I searched for Stocking <br/>
where it belonged and also where it didn't belong (who says <br/>
lightening doesn't strike twice?).  By this time, the light was just <br/>
beginning to start to fade, so I had to rush out, and never got the <br/>
chance to search for the rest of the ornaments.  It's nice to know <br/>
that, with the exception of Stocking, the rest of the ornaments *are* <br/>
there so that when I go back, I'll focus on the "known found" ones <br/>
first and *then* use my psychic power (bwahahaha) to find Stocking.<br/>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>The same thing happened to us the first time we headed out there - we <br/>
actually drove all the way around Burlingame and eventually found the <br/>
entrance &lt;here is where you all laugh :)&gt; and ran out of sunlight - <br/>
we actually thought that the Cuckoo/Pickle/Gingerbread Man trio was <br/>
on the path before reaching the kettlehole.  At one point, I was <br/>
standing on the same side as the Gingerbread Man and didn't even <br/>
notice! (That was when we realized we found the right place and just <br/>
started looking under huge rocks...haha...)<br/>
<br/>
Warrior Woman: Maybe another 1/2 mile off-the-trail trek will find us <br/>
the Stocking?  Heehee...<br/>
<br/>
And one additional note: The Kindergarten Keepsakes box was in great <br/>
condition, but it appeared that a critter had nibbled off some of the <br/>
cover (just the lip, nothing substantial)...<br/>
<br/>
Now I wonder if we'll be able to do the SG mini-gathering next <br/>
weekend...</div>
