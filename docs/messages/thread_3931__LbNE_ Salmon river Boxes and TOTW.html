I drive by Salmon River everyday.  I was just heartbroken<br/>
driving by it this morning. This is reallly, reallly sad.  I hope that<br/>
you didn't find a total disaster out there today, Flutterby.<br/>

Let me know if there is anything I can do to help with the mess out there. <br/>

Flutterby, if my box is missing please let me know, I'll just re-carve  it, <br/>
along with the ones I still have to do at the castle.   LOL.  If they have <br/>
been taken it's to bad that whoever they are can't put  all that free time and <br/>
effort into some worthy cause, like teaching  someone to read or working to feed <br/>
and cloth the poor.  Really, in the  scheme of things, how ridiculous are <br/>
they that they have to steal pieces of  rubber. <br/>
