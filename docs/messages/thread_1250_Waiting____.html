We know how that feels.  A couple weeks ago, when we were in Maine we went over to the Schoodic Penninsula for the day.  It was low tide, so we went past lots of cool spots in order to have time to walk out to Moose Island.  After our island exploration we finished the one-way loop, picked up some lunch and headed over to do it again, this time going slowly to stop and see the sights.  We stopped at a great spot by the water for lunch, and afterwards Dan rested and I went in search of a box.  Well there was a man and woman in their car right next to the hiding spot!  I thought oh, how long will they stay?  They stayed FOREVER!!!  We explored tide pools, did a little reading, watched the tide come in, and after all that, they were still sitting there!  The woman was reading, while her husband slept (for over an hour).  Well, I don't really know how long they stayed because I was getting antsy and ready to move on.  So we did the loop and stopped to explore every little spot along the way.  Afterwards, when we were getting ready to head back to MDI, I talked Dan into taking the loop just 1 more time. (This being the 3rd trip!)  Luckily the coast was clear and we successfully found our treasure.  This one took a lot of patience, but it was well worth it.<br/>
