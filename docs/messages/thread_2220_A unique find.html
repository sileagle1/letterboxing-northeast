finding Rising Tall, we were hiking toward the trail to the picnic<br/>
grove  <br/>
when we spotted a bit of a zip-lock bag poking out from the leaves at<br/>
the base of a small tree very close to the trail.  Upon<br/>
investigation, we discovered a letterbox with stamp, ink pad and<br/>
logbook, but not one thing was written on the box or the logbook. <br/>
The stamp is a puppy dog holding a bone in its mouth - a cute<br/>
store-bought stamp that appeared fairly new.  Possibly it had been<br/>
stamped once or twice.  Talk about a box with no name!  We brought<br/>
the box home with us but will replace it if need be.  Was hoping<br/>
someone would recognize this and tell us what to do with it.  <br/>
