you put into it!  It was great to see so many local boxers!<br/>
<br/>
On a sad note Sam I am has misplaced the log book she brought to the event - a 8 by 10" <br/>
scrapbook that she won at the Greek event at Wendell.  It won't have her name in it, and only <br/>
has the stamps from the event in it.  She spent the afternoon with Siamese collecting all the <br/>
stamps in the lodge and is very sad that she left it behind.  She also left behind her trail <br/>
stamps.  One of them was found by the Wildcats - that was her hand carved music note.  The <br/>
other part is her stamp that has the words Sam I am.  I had that stamp made when she was a <br/>
baby (long before we where letterboxers).  That is a commerial stamp with a wooden handle.<br/>
<br/>
So.. please look in your trail bags and see if you have the lost stamp or logbook!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
