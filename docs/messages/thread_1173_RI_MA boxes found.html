CSCM and Rustypuff this weekend:<br/>
<br/>
Conanicut Cannons<br/>
<br/>
Duct Tape &amp; Whimsy II -- since we've stamped into this already, we<br/>
didn't stamp again, but did take an impression of the new stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Island Sanctuary<br/>
<br/>
Kirby &amp; Friends: Adeleine<br/>
<br/>
Kirby &amp; Friends: King Dedede -- box has been found by non-letterboxers<br/>
who wrote inappropriate entries in the log.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby &amp; Friends: Kirby in the Clouds -- log book, although fairly new,<br/>
was wet.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby &amp; Friends: Ribbon the Fairy -- box was exposed. We rehid it<br/>
carefully.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby &amp; Friends: Waddle Dee -- box was exposed. We rehid it carefully.<br/>
<br/>
N.E.S.S. #1<br/>
<br/>
N.E.S.S. #2<br/>
<br/>
N.E.S.S. #3<br/>
<br/>
The Warrior [mystery]<br/>
<br/>
We also checked on Rustypuff's Wandering Turtle mystery box. It is<br/>
still in place and awaiting your visit.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, we had our first official trail exchange on Sunday when we met<br/>
 Masters of the Universe at Kirby in the Clouds. They just started<br/>
boxing a week ago after reading the Time article.<br/>
