to sleep in so didn't take a shower before we went out (my thought <br/>
was why bother you are going to get get sweating &amp; dirty, no one sees <br/>
you in the woods anyway, &amp; I'd rather sleep the extra 20 minutes.)  <br/>
Well, I was proven wrong.<br/>
<br/>
When we came out from Father's Day flowers &amp; headed for Mt Misery in <br/>
Pachaug State Forest we met another couple hiking.  The man had a lot <br/>
of expensive camera equipment hanging around his neck.  As we turned <br/>
off the dirt road &amp; started walking up the Mt Misery trail, the man <br/>
introduced himself as a reporter from the Norwich Bulletin doing an <br/>
article on the Mt Misery trail. He said he would like to follow us up <br/>
the trail and take some pictures.  I tucked my sweat drenched hair <br/>
under my hat &amp; thought, oh my God, why didn't I take a shower this <br/>
morning!  He spent about a half hour hiking with us snapping away <br/>
while I inwardly cringed and tried not to look so much like a wet <br/>
dish rag.  <br/>
<br/>
He had never heard about letterboxing so we explained its history &amp; <br/>
what it was all about.  He snapped more pictures of us stamping in <br/>
and assured us that letterboxing would be mentioned in the article.<br/>

The article will appear in the Norwich Bulletin Sunday paper on <br/>
