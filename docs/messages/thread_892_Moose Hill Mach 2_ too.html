resist a return visit to Moose Hill since it is where we were lucky <br/>
enough to meet Brian &amp; Lori and Mark &amp; Sue last year. Plus, even <br/>
though she doesn't work there anymore, Rustypuff puts on a great <br/>
party. Thank you very much for a special outing! And, we met some <br/>
nice new friends too. *waves, hi, Nancy!*<br/>
