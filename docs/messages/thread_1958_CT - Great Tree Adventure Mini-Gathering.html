(CT_Sunflowergirl), my wifes cousin (lizzie lover), aunt (aunt sue), <br/>
and uncle (The Bronx Bomber) to The Great Tree Adventure in <br/>
Wallingford, CT.  We were lucky enough to meet up with a bunch of <br/>
letterboxers including Butterfly, Sadie &amp; Russ, Sojourner, The Lady <br/>
and The Whippet, and Phynstar.  It was a regular mini-gathering!<br/>
<br/>
To commemorate the event they pulled out a mini-gathering box.  The <br/>
book was made with sunflowers on the cover a title that <br/>
said "Letterboxer2002 comes out of hibernation with ... <br/>
CT_Sunflowergirl!!"  Ironically I had planned on carving a stamp <br/>
exactly like the gathering stamp of a sunflower with kokopelli in the <br/>
middle.  It was a real treat!  Kate(Lizzie Lover)loved every minute.<br/>
<br/>
I have decided that the stamp for the mini-gathering is officially my <br/>
new personal traveler and will only be given out when Amy &amp; I are <br/>
hiking together.<br/>
<br/>
It was really great seeing everyone.  I only wish I could have spent <br/>
more time catching up with all of you.  I hope we keep in touch  and <br/>
find tons more letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Safe Letterboxing!<br/>

It was so nice to meet and Greet Alan   his wife and the rest of his <br/>
group as well as the others that surprised us on the trail.  Sue <br/>
sojourner carved a wonderful event stamp and surprised Alan with it as a <br/>
gift. Good Job-- it is an added beauty in my log book.  I finally <br/>
changed the stamp in the last box with one a little bit better . The log <br/>
books are almost full and that will be the next thing to do.  Oh-- the  <br/>
woods are alive with  Dutchmans Breeches and in a day or two will take <br/>
your breath away with their beauty.  If you want to view hundred  in <br/>
bloom,  try The Great Tree Adventure , and look around  low  as you  <br/>
come to the last box.<br/>
Butterfly<br/>
Enjoy the spring - it will rush into summer<br/>
