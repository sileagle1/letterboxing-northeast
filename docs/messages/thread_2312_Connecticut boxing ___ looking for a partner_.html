<br/>
Although I don't mind 'boxing alone, most times I'd rather do it with<br/>
someone else -- especially if I'm going to drive a distance to get a box.<br/>
<br/>
The great thing about hooking up with other letterboxers (other than<br/>
not having to box alone) is that I get to meet and make the<br/>
acquaintence of some great people and perhaps even develop a few<br/>
friendships along the way.<br/>
<br/>
So far, I've had the pleasure to 'box with Warrior Woman, Choi, Tony &amp;<br/>
Veronica, someone named Sue from Central MA, and, at the Mansfield<br/>
Monster Mash, Northstar, and Scarab.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be headed out with Music Woman on Friday, and hopefully<br/>
connecting with Team Green Dragon this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
And I still can't get enough!<br/>
<br/>
Of all the boxes I've found so far, all have been in Massachusetts,<br/>
Rhode Island, New Hampshire, or New York, with the exception of some<br/>
68 found as part of the Mansfield Monster Mash.  However, most of<br/>
Connecticut is "untapped" for me.<br/>
<br/>
With so many boxes in that state, I'd like to go after some this<br/>
season, but only really want to if someone will come along with me. <br/>
You could already live in Connecticut and we could meet up for a full<br/>
day of 'boxing, or you could join me on an overnight with the camping<br/>
gear for a weekend of 'boxing.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment I don't have any particular part of the state I'm more<br/>
interested in that others, so I'm open if you are.  I was thinking of<br/>
trying to partner up with someone to head out in mid-September.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone's interesting on planning a 'boxing day (or weekend) with<br/>
me, send me an e-mail off-list.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks!<br/>
<br/>
