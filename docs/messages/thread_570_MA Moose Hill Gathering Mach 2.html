MA on <br/>
Sunday, June 27 from 1 p.m. - 5 p.m. for the second annual Moose Hill <br/>
Gathering! <br/>
<br/>
We are hoping to see some familiar faces and perhaps welcome some new <br/>
folks <br/>
(as the nature center has put this in their program bulletin). This <br/>
time we <br/>
hope for a lovely day and to be able to use the picnic tables <br/>
outdoors. Last year <br/>
we fit 80 of us into the nature center on that bitterly cold January <br/>
day <br/>
(shiver!).<br/>
<br/>
The potluck nature of these events always leaves us with tons of <br/>
food, so <br/>
CSCM and I  will provide cold drinks and leave the rest to fate. I <br/>
will carve an <br/>
event stamp, but others are welcome to carve too. There are several <br/>
boxes on <br/>
the sanctuary, but I'm sure there will be some event-only boxes as <br/>
well. Let us <br/>
know if you are able to come by RSVP'ing.<br/>
<br/>
See you there!!<br/>
