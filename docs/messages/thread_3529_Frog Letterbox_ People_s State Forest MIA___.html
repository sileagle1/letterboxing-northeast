letterboxing and love it!<br/>
<br/>
We recently (almost) completed the Nature of the Forest (both parts) <br/>
series placed by the Engraver and Music Woman (I think - doing this <br/>
from memory at work). We were unable to find the Frog Letterbox off the <br/>
Agnes Bowen trail. I am 99.44% sure we were in the right place, looking <br/>
under the correct box. None of the other boxes had been stamped since <br/>
fall, 2006. Can anyone confirm that the Frog is there or MIA?<br/>
<br/>
Any/all help greatly appreciated.<br/>
