to load photos of the detectives - and have apparently reached an over <br/>
load and locked it up - so sorry.   I'll have to ask the site manager <br/>
to fix things.  Guess there were just too many detectives!  It was <br/>
more fun than I could have imagined, thanks Deanne &amp; Dave, Mark &amp; Sue.<br/>

And my pre-gather event stamp was planted &amp; now posted : Flamingo <br/>
