<br/>
A friend of mine asked for recommendations for letterboxes along her<br/>
route from MA to NY (90-&gt;84-&gt;91-&gt;95). Since I have never boxed along<br/>
that route, I turn to the esteemed members of this list for your<br/>
recommendations on the best boxes along that route with an under 2<br/>
mile RT hike.<br/>
<br/>
I know about the AQ route planner and the PepeDavidow I95 box lists,<br/>
but I need your help in picking out a few gems, esp around New Haven<br/>
where she'd be most likely to want to stop to stretch her legs.<br/>
<br/>
Please respond offlist -- anyone who wants to know the results, email<br/>
me for a compilation.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for your insights.<br/>

There are several in Lenox, MA which is exit 2 on I-90 (Mass Pike).  <br/>
There are a couple "drive by's" and several with a hike.  Here's the <br/>
list:<br/>
