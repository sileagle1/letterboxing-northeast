We are using the original logbook (there were plenty of pages left) and Dave carved a replacement stamp. We hope someone finds it soon and  takes it to see more than two boxes this time. ;) If any of you come across it in your travels, let us know via this venue. I think we're going to start including the email addresses of these chat groups in our boxes' and hitchhikers' logbooks.I think that is why we don't hear more about our HH's - finders don't always know where to post the information. You can't really "contact the placer" with a HH.<br/>
 Good searching  to all!<br/>
