<br/>
I know how bad things can get.  I myself have been dealing with a back <br/>
problem since Sept. of 2004. The Dr fixed my back BUT he also pinched a <br/>
nerve that left little feeling in my left leg :-(<br/>
<br/>
Stay strong and try not to let it get you down, for better days are <br/>
ahead 'cause you both are good people :-)<br/>
<br/>
Take Care<br/>

I Care<br/>

  I figured I better post just what Chickabirdie's problem is. Barbara (Chickabirdie) had been complaining that she hurt very badly in the calves of her legs when walking any distance oat all. To make it short, it turns out she was only getting 5% of the blood flow in both her legs. She needed to have the arteries in her stomach and upper legs taken out and replaced with synthetic material. The operation was at Hartford Hospital. The operation took 6 hours, recovery room 5 hours. She was supposed to be in the hospital 1 week. Due to problems with her G.I. Tract bouncing back slowly it turned out to be 12 days. We've also experienced several other problems here since Molly's death, some small some big in a short period of time. It's been a rough spring and summer so far. I'm just waiting for something else to happen. Fight each battle as they come I guess.... Chuck<br/>
