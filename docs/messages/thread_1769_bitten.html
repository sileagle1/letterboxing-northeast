                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1535340861">So, I read about letterboxing in the AAA magazine earlier this month, and<br/>
thought it sounded like fun. I am a reporter for a small weekly paper - I<br/>
checked the towns we cover, and there are boxes here! I talked to my editor,<br/>
who agreed it was a go. Last Saturday, we (my 3 daughters and me, plus my<br/>
editor) printed up some clues and headed out. Today we ran a feature article<br/>
on letterboxing, complete with a bit of my account of our trek to find a box<br/>
 plus an interview with the planters of a couple of the boxes and photos of<br/>
my daughters, icy fingered and rosy cheeked, after getting a stamp in our<br/>
book. We are up to five stamps now, including one hitch hiker, and are ready<br/>
to plant a couple in our home town. We were hoping to go on Saturday, but it<br/>
looks like snow again, and after freezing last weekend, I think we'll stick<br/>
a little closer to the woodstove until its a bit warmer out. <br/>
Stamps we found in good shape - Oliver Mill, Trout under Eagle Bridge (both<br/>
of them,) Partridge in a Pine Tree, and the North compass hitch hiker. <br/>
<br/>
What fun!<br/>
