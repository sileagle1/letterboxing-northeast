<br/>
I went and picked up 2 shortly after the New Year. The sign said, "NOW ONLY $6.88!!"  but they charged me $9.99. I noticed right after I got the sales slip and called them on it. So the cashier had to call someone in authority who didn't even know where they were, of course, to go validate my claim, and she came back to let the cashier know.  So this caused a lot of huffing and puffing because they made her reimburse me for the full price and create a refund slip for my credit card, then charge me the lower price on a new transaction,  which caused a long line and grumbling customers.  But I got a refund for the error plus tax.  I would bet that they never changed the item price in the computer system. It's typical of these types of stores to do this because they count on errors not being detected or people just saying, "Oh, forget it!  I don't have time for this!" Cynical?  Maybe. I shop there a lot and it's happened before. I try to watch them when ringing but often can't keep up because the counters are so small that you are still dragging stuff out of the cart while they are ringing, so I try to check the slip right away.  They are either routinely inept, or slick.<br/>
<br/>
If I were in your position and had the sales slip, I'd go in and check to see what they are charging as of RIGHT NOW.  If they are the lower price, ask for an adjustment. If they don't want to do it, tell them you'd like to return them for the amount on your original sales slip for a refund, and then go walk around the register and buy them again at the lesser cost. Chances are they won't make you do that but if they insist on being nonsensical about it, follow through. Or get all your money back and walk out, and buy them elsewhere if you get really disgusted. You need to figure out what's most important to you.  If getting the poles for the lower price is what you really want, then just go in there with that mindset and dig in.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think the chance of getting a copy of the ad for that period is very good. Hey, I'm a wicked clutterbug but I don't have a copy.  &lt;s&gt;  They probably keep electronic records of the sales but won't readily admit that they can query that info. Just my 2 cents.  I saw them marked down for a few weeks, at least. <br/>

(who made them re-ring three candy bars that were originally .40 that should have rung in at the sale price of 3/$1. LOL!)  <br/>
