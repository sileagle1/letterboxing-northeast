out, I finally finished the clues at 11:20pm. If you printed anything <br/>
out before then, it was incomplete and you must re-print them. My <br/>
apologies for any inconvinience. All will be explained tomorrow.<br/>

them on either LBNA or on Atlasquest. Everything was not finihed until <br/>
12:00 midnight so if you are reading this before you leave, you should <br/>
check to see if everything is correct and that you  did not print out <br/>
partial clues. Due to computer problems, I will NOT have any printed <br/>
clues available with me. Sorry. Hope to see everyone tomorrow.(or now, <br/>
today)<br/>
