<br/>
I had a great time at the Great Cape Escape.  I letterboxed until after <br/>
dark.  <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I lost my signature stamp in the dark :(<br/>
<br/>
If anyone finds a hiking Labrador Retriever hand carved stamp in South <br/>
Yarmouth could you please contact me through Atlas Quest?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you greatly,<br/>

  I'm so sorry to hear that.  It also sounds sooo familiar.  I lost my mom's stamp while boxing until dark at the Pirates gathering in CT.  I love your stamp and hope you get it back.  Do you have any idea at which or between which box/boxes you may have lost it?  I will be in the area next weekend and would not mind taking a look around for you.  <br/>
