<br/>
We are sorry for the cross posting but we are so happy<br/>
we had to tell everyone. Paul ( Doing the HAPPY DANCE<br/>
) &amp; Mary ( I little tired )have hit 1007 for our PFX.<br/>
Yes with all the Monster hunting and exchanges while<br/>
Monster hunting we have hit 1007 PFX.<br/>
<br/>
First we want to thank MommaFox and Bald Eagle for<br/>
kidnapping us and forcing us to letterbox with them.<br/>
No we are only kidding. We love you guys and miss our<br/>
time together. Ever since that week-end on 8/29/2003<br/>
we have become addicted to this wonderful hobby. They<br/>
are really our best friends.<br/>
<br/>
We would like to thank everyone that has exchanged<br/>
with us or planted a letterbox for us to find. Without<br/>
all of you this never would have happened.<br/>
<br/>
THANK YOU !!!!!<br/>
