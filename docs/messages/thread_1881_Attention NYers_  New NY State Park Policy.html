other day that may have an impact on our letterboxing way of life in <br/>
the future. There are 7 pages of discussion on the groundspeak.com <br/>

restriction, accepting geocaching.  Personally I think it's only a <br/>

anything, what should we do, how will we respond?  For anyone <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Dear Libby,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I want to share with you something I read in the geocaching forum <br/>
&gt;the other day that may affect us letterboxers. I'm not a geocacher, <br/>
&gt;but recently got a GPS and want to do some benchmarking so I was <br/>
&gt;wandering through their site when I came across this thread started <br/>
&gt;on Jan31and ending a few days ago.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;NY Park and Rec Survey    <br/>
&gt;&lt;<a href="http://forums.groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=89985" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://forums.groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=89985</a>&gt;<a href="http://forums.groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=89985" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://forums.groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=89985</a> <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There is a lot to read if you have the time, but the gist is this, <br/>
&gt;NY State Parks and Recreation has implemented a new policy regarding <br/>
&gt;geocaches placed in NYS Parks. They are requiring geocachers <br/>
&gt;to apply for a permit to obtain stickers that must be placed on <br/>
&gt;the cache itself. There is no charge for the permit , however there <br/>
&gt;are restrictions. I've attached the Terms &amp; Conditions and a pdf of <br/>
&gt;the Permit Application.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  This has a lot of implications for letterboxing in NY. I fear we <br/>
&gt;are next! In fact, near the end of the aforementioned  thread <br/>
&gt;someone actually did write "What about letterboxing?" but it was <br/>
&gt;quietly overlooked except for a small reference in  a reply.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I don't know if the "Powers that Matter" know about us yet, but it <br/>
&gt;won't be long before some geocacher applying for a permit says, "How <br/>
&gt;come the Letterboxers don't have to comply?" and it will be in our <br/>
&gt;laps! I know you have a lot of letterboxes in Green Lakes SP and <br/>
&gt;since one of the restrictions is no more than five caches, per park, <br/>
&gt;per person  its going to affect you personally if washes over onto <br/>
&gt;us (letterboxers).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We have a window of opportunity to act, but how I'm not sure! I <br/>
&gt;haven't sorted out my own thoughts on this but time's awasting and I <br/>
&gt;thought others need to know about it!  I also thought you would have <br/>
&gt;a better idea of what to do with this information than I. With your <br/>
&gt;letterbox contacts maybe you could bounce it around for ideas first. <br/>
&gt;Should we play it close to our chest or have it go out on a list... <br/>
&gt;I don't know! I trust you to have a more rational perspective than I.<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt;Sorry, to be such harbinger of bad news! I felt you'd want to know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Respectfully,<br/>
&gt;MTnestRobin<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Whoa Nellie! I just went to attach the pdf and it was whole MB <br/>
&gt;size file! Here's the link instead. <br/>

&gt;For that matter, here's the link for the Terms and Conditions too, <br/>
&gt;that way you won't have to open an attachment. <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-792134664">I think we have to look on this as a positive development.  If we <br/>
don't, we risk reenforcing all the bad things that could be said <br/>
about letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
Principally the state is saying that geocaching (and letterboxing <br/>
eventually) can be done on public land as long as a series of rules <br/>
are followed.  We can debate the rules and ask for modifications <br/>
that may be applicable to letterboxing that are different from <br/>
geocaching, but I have no problems being welcomed to an area as long <br/>
as I follow rules.  These rules do not have the effect of preventing <br/>
geocaching (and eventually letterboxing), unlike the National Park <br/>
Service.  Having rules like these in place will prevent a problem <br/>
with one letterbox from having a backlash against all letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
Being willing to follow the rules of a park will show that we are <br/>
responsible people who want to enjoy the park and not cause any harm <br/>
to the environment.  This will enhance the image of our communities <br/>
with the park managers.  If this process of permits succeeds, it can <br/>
be used as a model for other lands owned by other organizations.<br/>
<br/>
This is something we need to see succeed.<br/>

letterboxing the way CT's DEP has, then it will indeed be wonderful. <br/>
Cautiously wander this path as it might lead to rule in the sport <br/>
that professes "there are no rules". <br/>
