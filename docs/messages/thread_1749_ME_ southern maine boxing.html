boxes will be replaced this spring in more permanent locations. The Robinson Woods <br/>
land trust is an excellent location prime for boxes (hint hint) with plenty of wildlife <br/>
viewing opportunities in the spring. It looks as though some of the area is abundant <br/>
with vernal pools. <br/>
<br/>
Enjoyed a late evening at Giddy's Serial Mystery box... though a little bit of <br/>
bushwacking at the end made it very interesting!! This was an awesome walk. <br/>
<br/>
We visited "Missing You" by Holster-Roo but unfortunately the stamp and felt <br/>
covering was frozen solid. Perhaps the box had a leak earlier in the winter. The <br/>
logbook was bone dry, but won't be when things start to thaw in the spring.<br/>
<br/>
We also snacked while visiting the Smiling Dragon on the way to "Seizing the Day" <br/>
which I must say is a most WONDERFUL box to do at this time of year!! <br/>
<br/>
Phyto also checked on DIZZY (Gillespie that is) and he's doing just fine - blowing the <br/>
blues away - plenty of visitors - and quite accessible even during the winter I might <br/>
add.<br/>
<br/>
Where have all the letterboxers gone?<br/>
