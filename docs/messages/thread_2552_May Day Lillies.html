                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1213735689">Hey, sorry I am a little behind in emails and trying to catch up.  So I guess here is an update:<br/>
<br/>
  We havent been out boxing very much at all the past couple of months.  We had some personal issues, that are now resolved, and everything is fine there now.  <br/>
<br/>
  The past 5 weeks have been very crazy especially.  I have spent 4 out of the past 5 weeks out of town for business.  The other week inbetween there I moved (from West Hartford to Manchester, CT).  In addition I am now taking grad classes and am in a production of Music Man (this is the final weekend go to www.cheneyhall.org if you are in CT and want to swing by and see it.  If you do let me know so I can bring stuff with me for exchanges).<br/>
<br/>
  Stacy also has been very busy lately.  She has been student teaching 1/2 day plus taking 4 classes.  In addition she was also in the show Company for a few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
  So between all of this we have not had much time for anything.  Now that most of my new place is unpacked and the long weekend is coming up for thanksgiving, I hope we can get so boxing done, that is once I get done with the 987 unread emails I have.  If you sent one directly to us, I hope I didnt miss it.  If you dont get a response, please resend it because it may be lost in the confusion.  <br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for the concern,<br/>
  Evan<br/>
