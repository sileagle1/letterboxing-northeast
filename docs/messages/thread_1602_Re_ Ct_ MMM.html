boxes yesterday at the Chatfield Gather. <br/>
I would like to report that some  50 odd~~ [pardon the pun :-D ]~~ <br/>
letterboxers visited ' The Monster in my Computer'  box.  I have been <br/>
having a wonderful time this morning reading the log book.  Thank you <br/>
everyone who found my box and then took the time to make  funny <br/>
comments. Sort of makes me feel less alone with the monster ,, seems he <br/>
has many cousin in other computers.!<br/>
Thanks again  to Chuck and all his helpers,  it was a REAL MASH<br/>
