<br/>
    I'd been gathering the impression (mostly unfounded) that there's some folks that are only interested in "getting their numbers up" - that is, power-walking through areas, ignoring the rgeat places, to get as many finds in an hour as possible just for the bragging rights of a big F#.  I thought it'd be a shame to dis' such appreciation of what others have put together for our enjoyment.  I had similar thoughts about the hitchhiker "feeding frenzy" described in a previous posting.  Just another way to "get my numbers up".<br/>
    That whole line of thinking totally ignores a few things.  Firstly, some people enjoy the thrill of the hunt.  The object is almost irrelevant to the speedy conclusion of the puzzle, thus giving the same feel as one who can finish a crossword puzzle before others - it's just a goal that some folks enjoy.  Whether it's my cup of tea or not is irrelevant!<br/>
    Secondly, some folks only get a small amount of free time.  Goodness knows I've had my letterboxing time cut short by Uncle Sam having the nerve to keep scheduling Reserve drills (the nerve!).  They collect stamps and appreciate them at home when they can.<br/>
    Thirdly, the areas described are often old terrain for many letterboxers.  If Schmedley Park has thirty letterboxes in it, and you've been there twenty-eight times, then the glamour has probably worn a bit thin.<br/>
    Then in re: the hithhikers at gatherings, well, I still would avoid those.<br/>
<br/>
BUT!  After seeing the LOVELY crafting of Mad Mary's Bass (in the 'Just Bass' LB), I'm all in favor of collecting impressions of as many stamps as possible out of the sheer appreciation of the artwork.  I may not count a hitchhiker from an event pile on a table as a real Find (until I really Find it), but I'd sure like to take an impression to show my family and friends!  They get as much of a kick out of them as I do, and some of my family can't get outdoors.<br/>
    So I'm going to be kinder of thought in the future.  I'll happily accept that others' strange ways are their way of enjoying a game with no rules, anyway.  And I'm going to enjoy the fruits of others' labors, try to emulate them, and thank them for the wonderful places they lead me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, guys!<br/>

Dear Dave,<br/>
<br/>
This is the reason why I am so anxious to "adopt" those so very<br/>
special boxes when the original placer has either gone on to bigger<br/>
and better things, or is too busy to keep up with their boxes (as is<br/>
the case with Mary - future plumber to be!).<br/>
<br/>
I have the pleasure of being the maintainer of both of her boxes<br/>
(Just Bass and Point Judith). I have had to replace the container,<br/>
the log book, the ink pads, just about everything on Point Judith<br/>
about four times in the last year.<br/>
<br/>
And, as you know, how can you *not* stop at Just Bass? The location<br/>
is absolutely spectacular and the image stamp is beyond compare.<br/>
<br/>
I am so glad that you enjoyed this box.<br/>
<br/>
And I agree with your philosophy. At the upcoming New England Event,<br/>
I am deliberately hosting a hitchhiker hostel so that all the<br/>
hitchhikers that are brought are not all over the table. You bring<br/>
one, you get to take one - no stamping frenzy.<br/>
<br/>
And I now have a very *very* special personal traveler that I carry -<br/>
a hand carved gift from Funhog. And who will get the image of this<br/>
stamp? Those folks that *truly* appreciate hand carving, not just<br/>
someone who wants to up their X count. My signature stamp will have<br/>
to do.<br/>

</span></blockquote>I agree with and practice this PFX count. I made an Event Stamp  <br/>
at the Maine Event with some Cuckoo clues leading up to it.  I wanted <br/>
to keep the cuckoo stamps out on the trail for people to enjoy.  So I <br/>
set all of them out at a nearby trail.  The exception being the one <br/>
that led up to the event stamp. I left that one out and made the <br/>
event stamp into a HH. Only those people who got the stamp leading to <br/>
the event stamp were at the event giving them a total of 10 stamps <br/>
and everyone else with 8 (the 9th being the HH). If anyone wonders if <br/>
they are missing any type of special stamp...they are not it is just <br/>
an indicator. One for locating the stamp at the event and one for the <br/>
fact that they were there.  If you would like to see it, I will be <br/>
happy to show you it! <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, should someone choose to do this trail and was also at <br/>
the event they will have double images. Fortunately, I expressed this <br/>
in the write up.  Unfortunately, they miss a quaint trail near the <br/>
ocean! Fortunately, the trail is big enough to add more!!!<br/>
