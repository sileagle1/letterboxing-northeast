<br/>
Last November I planted a 'box as a tribute to our esteemed Jay Drew: Over the Mountain:  <a href="http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=44319&amp;boxname=Over_the_Mountain" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=44319&amp;boxname=Over_the_Mountain</a> <br/>
<br/>
I had intended for Jay to get first crack at this 'box. Unfortunately at the time Jay didn't think he would be able to get out that way and he suggested I put the clues up for everyone else. I'm patient and thought I'd wait awhile to give him a shot at it.<br/>
<br/>
Now almost a year has passed. I still hope Jay will be able to hunt this 'box sometime but I have taken his advice and posted the clues for the Lb'ing community at large. I checked on the 'box today and it waits patiently where I left it last year, have at it. :D<br/>
