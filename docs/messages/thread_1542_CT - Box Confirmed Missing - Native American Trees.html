live and eat out there in the woods!! (I am hoping that my red stamp <br/>
pad did not poison them).  That is their 'home' ... we letterboxers <br/>
share their domain with their permission only!  Do we even realize <br/>
how many times our little boxes of art in the woods are visited, <br/>
sniffed, examined, nibbled by the critters we so enjoy seeing on our <br/>
boxing adventures... alas.. bless the coyote and his relations that <br/>
they tolerate our hobby so well.<br/>
<br/>
I did not mean to come across as to blame the critters,<br/>

in rock and don't even stand a chance unless small mammals are capable<br/>
of moving boulders. I'm not saying they aren't, but the longevity of a<br/>
box totally depends upon whether or not you're covering the box with<br/>
rocks and it has drainage versus just throwing some haphazard sticks<br/>
and leaves on top of it and hoping that nothing will drag it away.<br/>
