did manage to plant two seasonally themed series in the snow!  <br/>
Seems those conditions may be over now, but you can still look <br/>
for these boxes for another month or so.  Nothing special - just <br/>
some store bought stamps Wanda brought back from her last <br/>
trip to Ohio, but if you want to look for 8 boxes that one can easily <br/>
find even in the snow, here's your chance!<br/>
