 <br/>
We went out today in many inches of snow that had not been walked on yet to place this amazing box by Murray Herd of OR with an incredible carving!!!<br/>
 <br/>
Please bring "colors" with you. Red, blue and brown will do nicely. Or, if you are going to stamp a solid color, please use a light one so that others after you may still have the option. <br/>
 <br/>
The pups did an awesome job of covering any direct route to the box ;-)<br/>
 <br/>
Enjoy this month's contribution and be sure to get it before it is pulled for the month and sent on. <br/>
