wrong side of the bridge and were wondering what was up with the <br/>
directions, since there was no telephone pole on the side of the <br/>
bridge we were on.  We did not give up, but searche near all of the <br/>
light posts for a crop of rocks and were delighted to find your <br/>
wonderful, hand carved stamp.  Thank you for planting boxes at <br/>
covered bridges, we explored two of them and will visit the rest on <br/>
our next visit out there.<br/>
