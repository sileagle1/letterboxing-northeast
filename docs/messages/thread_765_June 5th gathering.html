  Thanks, Deb, for the contact at Tarrywile. I did e-mail her in hopes of <br/>
securing a tent site for Saturday. Certainly this is frustrating, but a question <br/>
comes to mind: Is Alan O.K.? I don't know Alan, but he doesn't seem like <br/>
someone to simply "drop the ball" and leave it at that. If anyone has alternate <br/>
camping thoughts let me know. I bought a tent just for this event and I'd like to <br/>
use it anyway. Safe trails to all.<br/>

<br/>
We did email the contact person that Deb was nice enough to share.  <br/>
This is what she told us.<br/>
<br/>
___________<br/>
We are going to try and accommodate campers as best we can.  In<br/>
order to do so, we are not issuing any camping permits ahead of time -<br/>
 we<br/>
will be holding a group meeting at 3:00ppm at the Red Barn - we will <br/>
decide<br/>
then how to accommodate everyone who wants to camp.  Camping will be <br/>
in<br/>
group style only.<br/>
<br/>
We will try to do what we<br/>
can but you will need to bear with us.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Sandy Moy, Manager<br/>
Tarrywile Park<br/>

We are still undecided.  We already have a babysitter so, we might <br/>
just go anyway.  Good luck and maybe we will see you there.<br/>

<br/>
We regret that we are unable to attend, however we too will be <br/>
camping... camping in Norwich at the Relay for Life. Of course, our <br/>
pop-up camper is a little less likely to float away (grin - last <br/>
memorial day our tent almost DID float away so we 'camped' in the <br/>
Expedition!)<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone has a safe and fun weekend at the gathering!  We know <br/>
there's numerous trail walks planned at Avalonia, West Farms, and <br/>
other land trust properties....a little homework will likely yield a <br/>
box or two or....<br/>

<br/>
As many of you heard, camping was cancelled at Tarrywile for lack of <br/>
preperation (on my part).  I have been trying to contact Mrs. Moy at <br/>
Tarrywile to fix this blunder.  I am also working on Putnam Park in <br/>
Bethel as a backup.  I will post with more information early <br/>
tommorrow.  Sorry for the mistake.<br/>
