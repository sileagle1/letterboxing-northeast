from the recent Greek Myth-Story Event posted on lbna and AQ under<br/>
Mystery Boxes. All have brand-new logbooks, ink, and are ready for<br/>
visitors! Note that some boxes have been relocated. Sadly, 2 boxes<br/>
were lost due to human intrusion, Bacchus and Cyclops. Fortunately,<br/>
all other boxes survived the tornado! :)<br/>
<br/>
This has been classified an EXTREME box series, owing mostly to the<br/>
extreme challenge of getting through the tornado zone (ie Tree-<br/>
Whacking), but also it is a pretty long hike.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and tell me your stories!<br/>
