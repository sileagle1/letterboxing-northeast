<br/>
I know many of you are preparing and downloading clues for the May Day<br/>
Gathering, but I had to take a few minutes from those activities to<br/>
thank MayEve and Wild Rover for such a fun and box-filled event. The<br/>
debut boxes are superb and we heartily encourage others who could not<br/>
make it to look for these once the clues are posted.<br/>
<br/>
RTRW - big thanks for opening up your home to 30 or so hungry,<br/>
exchanging, stamping, wet, cold letterboxing addicts! The warmth of<br/>
your house and our welcome were very much appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
It was great to see some old friends and make and exchange with new<br/>
ones. And it was wonderful to see the bigger-than-expected turnout for<br/>
today's event, with boxers representing 4 states attending.<br/>
<br/>
Guess the weather can't keep a good boxer down! :-)<br/>

Tomorrow is the most important thing in life. Comes into us at midnight very clean. It's perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands. It hopes we've learned something from yesterday. <br/>
