<br/>
My family and I have only been letterboxing since September, but boy <br/>
have we had a lot of fun finding boxes since then! My 2 year old <br/>
daughter loved it when we let her pull the box out of it's hiding <br/>
spot. She got excited everytime we mentioned the word hiking.<br/>
<br/>
I had met some really nice folks at the Mansfield gathering and was <br/>
excited that I had found a hobby that fits with my love (and my <br/>
husband's love) for the outdoors!<br/>
<br/>
That's why it had saddend me so much to see all the hostility on the <br/>
LbNA site. I stayed silent, but was getting pretty discouraged about <br/>
my new hobby. I have been considering quitting the hobby all <br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
I'm so thankful that this new site has been created and that Preach <br/>
let me know of it. It has put the excitement back into letterboxing <br/>
for me. THANK YOU to all that made it happen!<br/>
<br/>
I am planning to go to the F-500 letterbox meet at Kathy John's in <br/>
Storrs CT. on Saturday the 13th. No, I'm not THAT good! I don't have <br/>
500 finds, but I do want to meet more of you and get some more <br/>
exchanges while I'm there. Can't wait til Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
Happy again,<br/>
