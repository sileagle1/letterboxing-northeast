                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-840182009">Hi - I got that stamp no problem - but I am not going back for the Middlesex stamp.  I have 5 of the 8 stamps - and willing to get the Derby and Redding stamps - but have trailed for Middlesex to no avail - so I know I won't get the 8th and final stamp.  I will still attend any planned gathering though.<br/>
