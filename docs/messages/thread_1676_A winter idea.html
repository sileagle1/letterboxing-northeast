Have you thought about making this a progressive snack kind of thing? <br/>
Stop at one boxer's house for some snacks, another for a sandwich, <br/>
another for dessert and coffee? <br/>
<br/>
Just suggestions - or - we could meet at one final house only and <br/>
have dessert and hot drinks with everyone contributing a dessert of <br/>
some kind? <br/>
<br/>
Or are we in this for just the boxing?<br/>

Fantastic idea!  When I started this I thought I'd just make lists and distribute them for people to do with what they wanted...  but I like that it's turned into a prospective event!<br/>
<br/>
My apartment is very small, and it's in Middletown, right in the middle of the state.  I could probably fit a few people if we wanted to do a drive by for a bathroom break or something but it's not suitable for everyone standing around and snacking... just not enough room.  <br/>
<br/>
So how many times should we venture out into the cold?  And is there a specific area that people are thinking of?  I can carve an event stamp.  :)<br/>

Should we start with just the dessert idea first? If that works in January maybe we can try a few stops in February? <br/>
<br/>
Sue &amp; I live in Kensington - geographical center of the state. I'd have to check with her but we'd probably be able to host the dessert thing at our house.<br/>
<br/>
What would you think about exploring this idea on the Newboxers Chat feature one of these nights - kill 2 birds with 1 stone?<br/>
<br/>
Pick out a night and time and anyone interested could brainstorm via the Chat feature?<br/>

Some of you interested in this Winter Boxing Drive may want to tune into this Sunday's Chat found on the Newboxer's List at 9pm EST for a discussion and planning of same. Thanks to Chrissy and MayEve for beginning this idea. I will check with Sue to see if we can host a bring a dessert to share time after the drive at our house. January and February are being tossed around now - 1 day per month and Hartford &amp; Tolland Counties have been mentioned. I'll try to keep our site up to date with the details and I'm sure Chrissy and MayEve will continue to post the developments here.<br/>
