                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1804111644">thanks guys for all the concern. yes the floods have come once more to new<br/>
hampshire. we are not doing to badly here. the schools are closed and the<br/>
streets are down but my basement subpump is  holding its own. the concern<br/>
now is the milton dam. if it doesn't hold then we are in for a 10 foot surge<br/>
of water. <br/>
<br/>
right now the areas south of us are worse. greenthumb and dave of team new<br/>
hampshire, from what i see on the news, are pretty much under water. my sons<br/>
live in york beach maine and the report from there is that the ocean has<br/>
taken over the beach front and is up to the housing line. possibility that<br/>
they will be evacuated today. <br/>
<br/>
thanks again for thinking of us up here!<br/>
