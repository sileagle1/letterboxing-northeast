I can't swallow the national digests any more and only skim by so <br/>
this will alleviate that problem and I can keep up with whats <br/>
happening especially if there is something cool in my backyard. Well <br/>
my Inn is truly an Inn of Winter now. I chose  clues that are larger <br/>
than the snow in all but the biggest storms  so it should be <br/>
available just waiting for what the wind blows in next.  See you all <br/>
out there on  the trails soon , carol - Leader of the Pack</div>
