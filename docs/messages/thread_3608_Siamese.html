My partner, Siamese, had knee replacement surgery yesterday. She is <br/>
doing fine and sounds enthusiastic about getting on with her rehab even <br/>
though she knows that is going to entail pain. At least it is pain <br/>
with a positive outcome which is quite different from the chronic pain <br/>
she has been living with...and I don't mean me.<br/>

  I do not know Siamese -- but am sending best wishes for a speeding recovery from knee surgery . Been there , had that ,  and most who know me, know I  am over 75  and am doing fine, it was a long winter of leg up - ice packs - etc,  but swimming, walking and biking  and lots of wonderful friends, have put me back on the trail and I wish the same for you .<br/>
