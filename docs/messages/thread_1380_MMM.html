Lenny for all of the hard work they put into such a wonderful event. <br/>
I had so much fun meeting and greeting, playing monster trivia and <br/>
bingo, and collecting stamps that the day just flew by. Thanks also <br/>
to all the unsung heroes who carved the wonderful stamps for all the <br/>
boxes that were planted for the event. What a great time!<br/>
Queen B and Hive<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Thanks also from NJCarole, Katze21539, and Lucky Wolf.</div>

<br/>
The Alphabet Bandits would like to say WOW!  The MMM was our first ever gathering... what a way to get started!<br/>
<br/>
The Baby Bandits had a great time... running amok among the piles of rocks.... stamping anything paper that was not moving....  they even won a Halloween decoration they've been asking me to buy... meeting new friends...  They've already asked when the next one will be.  uuuhhhh, I know it's a little early... Chuck?????<br/>
<br/>
Don't know if we'll get back over there to get all those great boxes.... it's a two hour drive for us... Goodness knows I've done crazier things in the name of letterboxing... we'll see...<br/>
<br/>
I'm already up and carving.... what an ego boost you all can be! so much PZKut... so little time!<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day for all of you who are headed out, have a restful day for all those who are staying in and Happy Boxing to Everyone!<br/>

let her out till 6:20 tonight. After 11 hours of monster hunting <br/>
Phynstar finished all the monsters in the series but seems to be too <br/>
tired to write to the list herself :-)<br/>
We came home with 37 new stamps and a Cathy John dinner under our <br/>
belts.<br/>
Thanks to all the monster carvers. I'll NEVER get them all but the <br/>
ones I have are awesome.<br/>
