my gloves.  Today I visited Lebanon again and was able to complete <br/>
the hidden Cemetary series which eluded me due to impending dark back <br/>
in December. Kiakahi"s carvings run the gambit from whimsical (like <br/>
Hidden Soul to serious like Hidden Cross. Thanks to added hints from <br/>
a fellow letterboxer, I was able to return to Exeter Cemetary <br/>
for "Pioneers".  for "Pioneers in Lebanon". At Bartlett Brook I was <br/>
able to find Needeep's Missouri stamp, then on to the Lebanon fire <br/>
Dept. Hoowee..that was a very public place! However, I managed to <br/>
successfully stamp into "Local Heroes". Thanks you wonderful l.b. <br/>
carvers and placers!<br/>
