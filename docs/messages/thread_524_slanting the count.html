I appreciate the comments and suggestions about my decision to pull my clues and access <br/>
to them being on our site only. It's really no different - it eliminates the middle step of <br/>
going to the LBNA site and just going to ours. I do hear Dave and Diane however, it does <br/>
get confusing when you're searching by an area.<br/>
<br/>
I really like Pete's suggestion of posting one clue/link if you will on the site with a grand <br/>
box total count (that of course i guess i could update...) and that way the official "box <br/>
count" for maine would be "official" if you will and that it could directly link to our home <br/>
page thus pointing people in that way from the lbna site. I'll have to chew on that, but i do <br/>
like the idea.<br/>
<br/>
The truth is that I'm not in it for the numbers. If i were, then i would have been completely <br/>
absorbed in boxing my way through Connecticut ( no offense ) sooner than now. i'm in it <br/>
for placing and crafting clues and stamps that bring people to those places that are so <br/>
very special to me. This of course includes mostly Maine, but in some cases - out of state <br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
The *only* issue I really see with the way that i'm choosing to opt out of the LBNA site is if <br/>
the population of placers/finders increases in this state and those who are unaware of my <br/>
clues just blindly go about placing boxes in the same spot - then that would be tacky.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what the best solution is, but I figure that people in england have been doing <br/>
something right for a very long time...<br/>
