<br/>
I'm happy to say that there have indeed been some finders of my HIrundo series. <br/>
This is a 7 stamp series with 6 film canister microboxes and 1 regular sized box. <br/>
Sad to report that 1 of the microboxes is missing (Lac d'Or - "Lake of Gold") <br/>
however, all the rest are in place and survived the change of season.<br/>
<br/>
While we were visiting this unique area we came across several vernal pools that <br/>
were teaming with clusters of frog and perhaps salamander eggs!!! This is very <br/>
exciting indeed since I missed "big night" all over the state. While also out <br/>
walking the trails we saw evidence of last fall's fungi - a "hens nest" mushroom <br/>
cluster as well as 2 butterflies already! Spring has definitely sprung in Maine :-)<br/>
<br/>
Finally, please note that I will be revising the Hirundo clues to make them more <br/>
user-friendly. Lac d'Or will be carved and replaced most likely this week.<br/>
<br/>
For anyone that still wishes to torture themselves with the old difficult clue <br/>
directions here is the link: <br/>
