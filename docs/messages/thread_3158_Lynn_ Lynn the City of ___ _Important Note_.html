<br/>
The Lynn, Lynn the City of ... series was planted yesterday and I <br/>
needed to update the clues today. As it turns out, one of the boxes <br/>
were very close to a yellowjacket nest and the first finders got stung <br/>
multiple times. <br/>
<br/>
The box has been moved and there is no need to go anywhere near the <br/>
hazard.<br/>
<br/>
If you go, make sure you print the new clues. I would hate to hear <br/>
someone else got stung by searching in the old location.<br/>
