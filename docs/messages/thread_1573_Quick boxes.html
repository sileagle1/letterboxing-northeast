   We have been out of the loop since early Sept, my 11  year old broke her <br/>
foot in 2 places, she is fairly healed now, and we would love  to get out and <br/>
do some boxing today as it is so nice, but long walks are not  within our reach <br/>
yet, any suggestions???   We are in Western MA, we do  intend on trying to <br/>
get to plymouth next weekend to get the november only boxes  and others that are <br/>
there, but would love to get out today for some quick  ones.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much,<br/>
<br/>
Aj and munchkins<br/>
(aka the letterbugs)<br/>
