needed boxing! After dropping off the non-letterboxing chaff, I set <br/>
out to find the elusive Red Dragon. I was successful this time <br/>
around. I then went in search of the "Three Seashells by the <br/>
Seashore" boxes. All were found with no problem, however- box #3 was <br/>
missing it's stamp and inkpad. I then headed out of the park to <br/>
visit "Book Barn" and "Relax and Read". What an awesome bookstore!! <br/>
I spent some time walking the grounds and inspecting the various <br/>
sections. Heading back to Rocky Neck, I sought out "Two Cats"and <br/>
found them with no trouble. Back inside the park I scooped up boxes <br/>
1,2&amp;3 of "Marshland~Woodland~Water" before taking a swim. After <br/>
leaving the park for the day, I decided I was not finished. I picked <br/>
up "The Travelling Man"+ the "Running Roads" h.h. and also "A Fishy <br/>
Tale. While driving home, I found I was still not satisfied, and <br/>
thusly, set about to find "The Wedding Rock" and "The Secret <br/>
Garden", both in excellent condition. "The Secret Garden" made my <br/>
500th find to date as I find myself zeroing in on my first year <br/>
anniversary of this great hobby. If not for letterboxing, there are <br/>
things I might never have seen and places I might never have been. <br/>
Most of all, there are the people who make letterboxing what it is. <br/>
Without these personalities, the finds would be that much more <br/>
empty. Thank you to everyone who joined me in the first part of this <br/>
journey, I hope to see you all again in the next part.  ---<br/>

when we were trodding up and down some very rocky terrain together.  <br/>
Well, I am also glad to hear that My Running Roads HH made it into <br/>
your collection!!<br/>

Once again Congrats!  Take Care out there<br/>
