The weather cooperated beautifully and it seemed like everyone was just enjoying the delicious food and relaxed atmosphere. Thanks CPAScott for your great idea and all you did for this gathering and to SapphireBerry for adding all your special touches. <br/>

enjoyable time. I actually got to look people in the eyes and talk with<br/>
them, rather than staring down at logbooks the whole time. Nicely done. I<br/>
wouldn't have changed a thing.<br/>

great event stamp carving!  Dave, excellent job manning the grill!  <br/>

You'll just have to try harder to limit the number of stamps next <br/>
time.  I know that this was simply not your best effort in that <br/>
regard.  Everything else, though...top notch.  <br/>
<br/>
To all Old Fashioned Gathering Attendees:  If you are missing the <br/>
following items I have them, contact me off-list:<br/>
* two blue metal "star pattern" trays<br/>
* a red lunch bag<br/>
<br/>
If you are missing anything else, then I know for certain that it was <br/>
not left in the pavillion area.<br/>

  I do think the red lunch 'box' (bag type thingy) is mine tho, it had <br/>
a half a roast beef (now a gross beef)sandwich and a cloth covered <br/>
ice 'pack' in it... I was wondering where I left that dang thing <br/>
again!  (and the major reason why I don't have/carry a 'purse'!<br/>
