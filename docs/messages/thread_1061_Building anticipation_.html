                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1855248797">Woo hoo!  We are ready to plant our first box ... and are planning <br/>
on doing so tonight!  A second box is in the works, and will be <br/>
planted soon as well (if time permits to finish the stamp, it too <br/>
may be planted tonight!)<br/>
<br/>
At least one of the boxes will be a mystery box, and we're toying <br/>
with the idea of making them both mystery boxes.  If not, the one <br/>
non-mystery box will have listed in the clues the name of the town <br/>
you need to travel to, but will not specifically direct you further <br/>
than that -- you'll have to figure out where in the town yourself.  <br/>
Again, we haven't decided on whether we're going to tell you the <br/>
town or not, so be prepared to do some work!<br/>
<br/>
We've decided that our clues will not be straightforward, nor will <br/>
they be overly cryptic, but rather somewhere in-between.  You'll <br/>
have to do a little research before heading out.<br/>
<br/>
Our intention is to place the box (or boxes) and then test the <br/>
clues.  We haven't decided if we want to find someone else to hunt <br/>
for the box before publishing the clues (a beta test) yet or not.<br/>
<br/>
So, that's all for now ... be on the lookout!<br/>
