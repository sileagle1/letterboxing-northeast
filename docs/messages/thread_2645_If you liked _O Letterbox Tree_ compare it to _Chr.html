Coincidence: One of Arcimedes'hitchhikers was a charter member, but was <br/>
one of the first to be exchanged out.  You need to leave a HH to take <br/>
one.  If you leave one without taking one, you can come back &amp; take one <br/>
later (so the number of HHs could decrease later on).<br/>
<br/>
OK, I can't boast about my carving, but the Santa stamp took me longer <br/>
than any other stamp so far.  <br/>
<br/>
"Christmas Spirit" was designed as a winter version of the Littleton <br/>
hostel, "Picking Apples with Sarah," before I heard about "O Christmas <br/>
Tree."  All 3 placements "immune to snow."<br/>
<br/>
You don't need a hitchhiker to come &amp; collect all 8 stamps.  So, if you <br/>
enjoyed "O Christmas Tree," you might also enjoy "Christmas Spirit."<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>

The 2nd box is off-trail, but it does not matter much when there is a lot of snow.  I used skis at least twice after we had 14 inches of snow.  <br/>
  Thank you for the compliment,  Morgun (Bob)<br/>
