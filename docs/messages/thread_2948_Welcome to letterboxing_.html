                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-579920304">i would like to take this second and welcome 2 new boxers to the <br/>
concord, nh area. i happen to come across them while placing an ink <br/>
pad in "concord's cool cat". A day after i placed that box and they <br/>
were already there. i would like everyone to welcome qltnanny and mike <br/>
davis to our wonderful world. qltnanny has only been boxing for 2 <br/>
weeks and found 7 boxes. what a start. keep it up.<br/>
<br/>
also i want to mention that "b is for billy" and "up, up, and away" <br/>
are back in place. the flooding has gone down so the boxes are back.<br/>
