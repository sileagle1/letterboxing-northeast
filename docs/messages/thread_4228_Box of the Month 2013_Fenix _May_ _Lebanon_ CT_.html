                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-336456400">Thanks Flutterby for another year of fun letterboxes! I highly recommend "subscribing" to this monthly box collection. Not only do you get some great carves for your logbook but it is really cool to leaf through the pages and see the sig stamps of boxers from all over the country.<br/>
<br/>
This year's series has a new twist: the boxes are in a different hide along the Airline Trail each month instead of being in the same spot. Brilliant idea! And one that inspired me to finally get out and hike the entire Airline from south to north. In sections of course, I'm not up to doing the whole thing at once.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again! Jay</div>
