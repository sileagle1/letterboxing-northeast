We are trying to find who might have the only copy of the clues for our Galveston Horror Letterbox. We have completely lost track of the clues and have had a couple of requests from boxers who would like to attempt the mystery.<br/>
<br/>
Please contact us off-list (drewclan at aol dot com) if you have the clue or if you have passed it on to someone else.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Jay &amp; Margaret in CT</div>
