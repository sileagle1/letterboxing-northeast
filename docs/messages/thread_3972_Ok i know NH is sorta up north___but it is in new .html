people would say, but I'd like to hear it anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I have a box (Read a  &lt;<a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=71963" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=71963</a>&gt;<br/>
book II) located in a state that I will not be returning to.  I do have some<br/>
boxing friends in the area that would assist me if any maintenance is<br/>
needed.  <br/>
<br/>
It is a microbox located in a library.  When I placed the box I had a small<br/>
log book inside.  Very small.  I was in the area for six months so I was<br/>
able to replace it when it filled up quickly.  But when I left the area I<br/>
removed the logbook as it just wouldn't make sense to try to maintain the<br/>
size book that would fit in the microbox.  I put the lack of a logbook into<br/>
my clues so no one would be confused.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have received an email from the library saying this:<br/>
Hi. The library does know about the lettebox, but we have a question: The<br/>
lack of a logbook is a little sad for some of our visitors. A big part of<br/>
the fun with our other letterbox (directions on AtlasQuest) is looking<br/>
through the logbook to see who else has been here.<br/>
<br/>
My question is this. I'm the library's Community Relations Coordinator. I<br/>
see you live out of the area. Is there a way we could work together to add a<br/>
logbook to your letterbox in our children's section?<br/>
<br/>
I am having mixed feelings.  On one hand, that's very nice and helpful of<br/>
them to offer.  On the other hand, part of letterboxing is stealth.  I don't<br/>
think I want people walking up and asking for the log book.  Plus, not every<br/>
box is the same.  There ARE boxes without log books.  Sure, people like<br/>
looking through the log book and adding their own stamp, that IS part of the<br/>
fun, I agree, but that doesn't mean it is a requirement.  <br/>
<br/>
Additionally, I wonder HOW they found out about the box.  I mean, I know<br/>
this happens, but I do wonder.  Perhaps a librarian, or friend of one is a<br/>
boxer and told them about it.  Or perhaps a would be finder went and asked<br/>
questions..... OR cried to a librarian "poor me, there is no log book, isn't<br/>
that sad, boo hoo".  A situation, which, obviously, bothers me.  I mean, too<br/>
bad, some boxes simply don't have logs, especially mircoboxes.<br/>
<br/>
When I planted the box I knew there is another (really wonderful) box it the<br/>
library that was planted with the library's assistance.  I didn't want mine<br/>
to be "known" or else I would have approached the library about it.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm sure people will have differencing opinions, and of course I can proceed<br/>
how I want, it is my box.   My gut is saying to pull it.  It is no longer a<br/>
secret and the library is telling me how to "run" my box.   <br/>
<br/>
Am I taking the low road here?  Would the high road be making a beautiful<br/>
log and sending it to them, saying Thanks, Librarian for helping me out!  I<br/>
know that is a very positive approach.  But I feel like my box is tainted<br/>
some how, it's just not feeling happy to me.  Which is odd because I am<br/>
usually very go with the flow and have a Pollyanna out look.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, what do you all think?<br/>

Well you will probably get a variety of opinions here but you did ask for  <br/>
opinions so here is mine:<br/>
<br/>
You say that lots of boxes do not have logbooks. I have found a few  boxes <br/>
and I do not see many (if any) letterboxes without logbooks. Some  boxes are <br/>
part of a series and some of the components of the series have their  <br/>
logbooks in the first or last box, but I don't know if I ever found a single  <br/>
stand alone box without a logbook. You seem to have wanted a logbook in this <br/>
box  when you were regularly maintaining it so why shouldn't that continue?<br/>
<br/>
I think you have a great opportunity here. Someone (a responsible someone)  <br/>
has offered to maintain this box. Was your real intent of this box to see <br/>
if you  could keep it a secret from the Librarian? Now that they are onto the <br/>
box  it doesn't need to be "hidden" from the Librarian so you could <br/>
actually arrange  to have it swapped out for a larger box and logbook. I think <br/>
"pulling your  box" because they know about it is a little drastic. For all <br/>
intents and  purposes you have abandoned this box. The library could "pull it" <br/>
for you by  throwing it away and then turn around and get rid of the other <br/>
nice box you  mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
As for people walking up to the Librarian and asking for the logbook, you  <br/>
could advise people not to do that in the clues.<br/>

I read the other two responses and agree that I have questions about the whole content of what you wrote, and think Larry covered it; but really you're asking for advice on what to do. In my opinion, there's no reason to pull a box that was warmly received by the library.  If you don't want it maintained, then perhaps contacting the placer of the other library box, and asking them if yours could be a bonus to theirs might be a way to go without a logbook.  Just an alternative you might not have thought about.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have gotten an email that has bothered me a bit. I think I know what most<br/>
people would say, but I'd like to hear it anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I have a box (Read a &lt;<a href="http://www.atlasque" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasque</a> st.com/showinfo. html?gBoxId= 71963&gt;<br/>
book II) located in a state that I will not be returning to. I do have some<br/>
boxing friends in the area that would assist me if any maintenance is<br/>
needed. <br/>
<br/>
It is a microbox located in a library. When I placed the box I had a small<br/>
log book inside. Very small. I was in the area for six months so I was<br/>
able to replace it when it filled up quickly. But when I left the area I<br/>
removed the logbook as it just wouldn't make sense to try to maintain the<br/>
size book that would fit in the microbox. I put the lack of a logbook into<br/>
my clues so no one would be confused.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have received an email from the library saying this:<br/>
Hi. The library does know about the lettebox, but we have a question: The<br/>
lack of a logbook is a little sad for some of our visitors. A big part of<br/>
the fun with our other letterbox (directions on AtlasQuest) is looking<br/>
through the logbook to see who else has been here.<br/>
<br/>
My question is this. I'm the library's Community Relations Coordinator. I<br/>
see you live out of the area. Is there a way we could work together to add a<br/>
logbook to your letterbox in our children's section?<br/>
<br/>
I am having mixed feelings. On one hand, that's very nice and helpful of<br/>
them to offer. On the other hand, part of letterboxing is stealth. I don't<br/>
think I want people walking up and asking for the log book. Plus, not every<br/>
box is the same. There ARE boxes without log books. Sure, people like<br/>
looking through the log book and adding their own stamp, that IS part of the<br/>
fun, I agree, but that doesn't mean it is a requirement. <br/>
<br/>
Additionally, I wonder HOW they found out about the box. I mean, I know<br/>
this happens, but I do wonder. Perhaps a librarian, or friend of one is a<br/>
boxer and told them about it. Or perhaps a would be finder went and asked<br/>
questions... .. OR cried to a librarian "poor me, there is no log book, isn't<br/>
that sad, boo hoo". A situation, which, obviously, bothers me. I mean, too<br/>
bad, some boxes simply don't have logs, especially mircoboxes.<br/>
<br/>
When I planted the box I knew there is another (really wonderful) box it the<br/>
library that was planted with the library's assistance. I didn't want mine<br/>
to be "known" or else I would have approached the library about it. <br/>
<br/>
I'm sure people will have differencing opinions, and of course I can proceed<br/>
how I want, it is my box. My gut is saying to pull it. It is no longer a<br/>
secret and the library is telling me how to "run" my box. <br/>

some how, it's just not feeling happy to me. Which is odd because I am<br/>

Naturally, they are protective of their domain, but once they see the value of having non-disruptive visitors...well, the Jamestown Library is still asking us to add more letterbooks!<br/>
<br/>
Having LBs in a library helps out our craft, I think, because it gives us a chance to keep 'boxing even in bad weather.<br/>

<br/>
While I understand your frustration, and you can do what you like with your<br/>
box, I agree with the general sentiment here. Although I can't hold a candle<br/>
to Larry's 3,000+ letterbox finds, I have never found a box that<br/>
*intentionallly* did not have a logbook, unless it was part of a series.<br/>
That's not to say there aren't any without logbooks, just that they are<br/>
extremely rare (at least in my experience), and finders can be puzzled by<br/>
it. If they found the box in the library, they might assume it was a library<br/>
box, and so asked the librarian to clarify why the logbook was missing, or<br/>
to try to be helpful and let the librarian know that it was gone. I think<br/>
assuming the best of people when you don't know the actual circumstances,<br/>
which it sounds like you usually do, may help you feel better about this<br/>
situation (?)<br/>
<br/>
Diane's comments reminded me that I have found abandoned boxes with missing<br/>
or full logbooks and they were *littered* with random pieces of scrap paper<br/>
that finders stamped and left in the box. And I mean *littered*, it was<br/>
awful to see these boxes crammed with all those paper scraps. Stamping in to<br/>
the box's logbook is part of the game; finders expect it, and may improvise<br/>
if they don't find it.<br/>
<br/>
That the librarian kindly offered to help you maintain the box is a nice,<br/>
feel-good kinda thing. I know people have had unauthorized boxes thrown away<br/>
w/unpleasant emails sent to the planter. I  can't see how this is the<br/>
library tying to tell you how to run your box. It looks to me like they were<br/>
making an objective observation (the patrons enjoy the logbooks, there is no<br/>
logbook in the box) and offering to help since you can't  maintain your box.<br/>
If it was me, I would have assumed you wanted a logbook in there, especially<br/>
since the box started with one. Perhaps you can send several small-enough<br/>
logbooks to them so they can keep the log in the box, preventing the need<br/>
for finders to ask the librarian about a logbook? Another option, rather<br/>
than pulling it, might be to transfer ownership to a local boxer, so people<br/>
can still enjoy finding it but you can still divest yourself of it?<br/>
<br/>
As you pointed out, it's up to you, it's your box. If it is going to<br/>
irritate you that it is no longer a secret from the library staff, then pull<br/>
it or transfer ownership. No point in leaving it there and monitoring the<br/>
finds if it raises your ire every time you think about it! It's easy for us<br/>
to describe our opinions--we have no emotional attachment to or expectations<br/>
for that particular box--what's important is *your* opinion.<br/>

My opinion: You have a letterbox in a library without permission, that you cannot maintain.The library found it, and are willing to work with you. They want a log book, people searching for the letterbox wanted a log book. Send them a log book, and anything else they ask for.....Chuck and Amy of WWW<br/>

<br/>
Am I taking the low road here? Would the high road be making a beautiful<br/>
log and sending it to them, saying Thanks, Librarian for helping me out! I<br/>
know that is a very positive approach. But I feel like my box is tainted<br/>
some how, it's just not feeling happy to me. Which is odd because I am<br/>
usually very go with the flow and have a Pollyanna out look. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, what do you all think?<br/>

My opinion: You have a letterbox in a library without permission, that you cannot maintain.The library found it, and are willing to work with you. They want a log book, people searching for the letterbox wanted a log book. Send them a log book, and anything else they ask for.....Chuck and Amy of WWW <br/>
<br/>
I have gotten an email that has bothered me a bit. I think I know what most <br/>
people would say, but I'd like to hear it anyway. <br/>
<br/>
I have a box (Read a &lt; <a href="http://www.atlasque" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasque</a> st.com/showinfo. html?gBoxId= 71963&gt; <br/>
book II) located in a state that I will not be returning to. I do have some <br/>
boxing friends in the area that would assist me if any maintenance is <br/>
needed. <br/>
<br/>
It is a microbox located in a library. When I placed the box I had a small <br/>
log book inside. Very small. I was in the area for six months so I was <br/>
able to replace it when it filled up quickly. But when I left the area I <br/>
removed the logbook as it just wouldn't make sense to try to maintain the <br/>
size book that would fit in the microbox. I put the lack of a logbook into <br/>
my clues so no one would be confused. <br/>
<br/>
Now I have received an email from the library saying this: <br/>
Hi. The library does know about the lettebox, but we have a question: The <br/>
lack of a logbook is a little sad for some of our visitors. A big part of <br/>
the fun with our other letterbox (directions on AtlasQuest) is looking <br/>
through the logbook to see who else has been here. <br/>
<br/>
My question is this. I'm the library's Community Relations Coordinator. I <br/>
see you live out of the area. Is there a way we could work together to add a <br/>
logbook to your letterbox in our children's section? <br/>
<br/>
I am having mixed feelings. On one hand, that's very nice and helpful of <br/>
them to offer. On the other hand, part of letterboxing is stealth. I don't <br/>
think I want people walking up and asking for the log book. Plus, not every <br/>
box is the same. There ARE boxes without log books. Sure, people like <br/>
looking through the log book and adding their own stamp, that IS part of the <br/>
fun, I agree, but that doesn't mean it is a requirement. <br/>
<br/>
Additionally, I wonder HOW they found out about the box. I mean, I know <br/>
this happens, but I do wonder. Perhaps a librarian, or friend of one is a <br/>
boxer and told them about it. Or perhaps a would be finder went and asked <br/>
questions... .. OR cried to a librarian "poor me, there is no log book, isn't <br/>
that sad, boo hoo". A situation, which, obviously, bothers me. I mean, too <br/>
bad, some boxes simply don't have logs, especially mircoboxes. <br/>
<br/>
When I planted the box I knew there is another (really wonderful) box it the <br/>
library that was planted with the library's assistance. I didn't want mine <br/>
to be "known" or else I would have approached the library about it. <br/>
<br/>
I'm sure people will have differencing opinions, and of course I can proceed <br/>
how I want, it is my box. My gut is saying to pull it. It is no longer a <br/>
secret and the library is telling me how to "run" my box. <br/>
<br/>
Am I taking the low road here? Would the high road be making a beautiful <br/>
log and sending it to them, saying Thanks, Librarian for helping me out! I <br/>
know that is a very positive approach. But I feel like my box is tainted <br/>
some how, it's just not feeling happy to me. Which is odd because I am <br/>
usually very go with the flow and have a Pollyanna out look. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, what do you all think? <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-637565981">Thank you to everyone who replied.<br/>
<br/>
I honestly was under the impression that I had read that a microbox may not<br/>
have a logbook.  I have looked at Randy Hall's book and I don't see it<br/>
there.  I looked at AQ glossary and I don't see it there.  I looked at<br/>
lb.org but I don't see it there. But that is really not "my" issue any way.<br/>
<br/>
What I realized is my issue is that I tend to react badly when someone tells<br/>
me what to do.  In fact, when someone tells me what to do I tend to want to<br/>
do the opposite just to show my ability to do it!  This is a left over knee<br/>
jerk reaction from dealing with my dad as a teenager and young adult.  I<br/>
thought I had mainly gotten over it but this situation showed me that I have<br/>
not :)<br/>
<br/>
Of course I am going to make a beautiful log and send it to them.  I do want<br/>
the box there and I am happy that they will help me care for it.  <br/>
<br/>
If I felt good about my initial reaction, then I wouldn't have come to the<br/>
group to ask advice.  It was because I knew my reaction was a poopie head<br/>
one that I did come asking for thoughts.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for those thoughts!<br/>
