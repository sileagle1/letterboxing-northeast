<br/>
I just got back from planting a new series that was the result of a <br/>
swap on the ArtGirl's list a little while ago. Jan of Team Little Dog <br/>
sent me 4 boxes to plant based on the Hex designs of the Pennsylvania <br/>
Amish.<br/>
<br/>
I would really like to send the boxes back to her filled with the <br/>
stamps of New England boxers, so please come and check out these boxes. <br/>
The area that they are in is beautiful (if a bit buggy this morning) I <br/>
counted over 100 lady slippers during my two hours on the trails here.<br/>
<br/>
Add to the fact that there is another box planted by Choi (Snakehead) <br/>
and the ease of the trail, you should definately come check it out :)<br/>
<br/>
Located in the Goldsmith Woodlands on Rt. 28 in Andover, MA.<br/>
<br/>
These boxes will be returned to their real home in November!<br/>
