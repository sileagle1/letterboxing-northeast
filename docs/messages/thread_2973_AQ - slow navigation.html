Subject: Re: This was on the LBNE list today<br/>
Yeah, I saw those, but I'm not really sure what I can do about it. =( I'll probably upgrade the site in another month or so which will probably help, but I find it perplexing they have so much trouble with it that they'd quit using the site. *I'm* on a dial-up connection and rarely have trouble accessing the site. Freezing constantly? <br/>
<br/>
I'm kind of wondering if they have a virus on their systems that might be making matters worse, but I can't really look into that theory. *shrug* <br/>

I was able to access AQ with absolutely no problems from my Mom's computer (she has AOL and dial-up !) so if I want to go to AQ, I will try from there. That way I will be able to load in our new HH's and planted box. <br/>
Thanks again for everyone's patience with me.<br/>
