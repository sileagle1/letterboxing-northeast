made it out to the Eastern MA Pagan Pride Project at the <br/>
Harold Parker State Forest yesterday (September 21st) in <br/>
North Andover. I have been really busy with my art <br/>
business and haven't gotten out to do much boxing, so it <br/>
was great to have the boxers come to me.... so wonderful <br/>
to see Choi, The Merry Pranksters, The Woodland Wanderers, <br/>
Go Catman, Music Man, The Sparrows Interest, Nature, <br/>
Caipora, Peeky and Vito, Old Hounder and Siamese, and I <br/>
was vending next to The Loon Witch, who also is a boxer <br/>
and planted a box! So thanks everyone for coming out, and <br/>
you can read more in my letterboxing blog <br/>
<a href="http://dragonflyboxes.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dragonflyboxes.blogspot.com/</a> <br/>
and for upcoming events and where I might have more <br/>
boxes... you can check out my other blog Musings from the <br/>
Fae at <a href="http://lennonstudio.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://lennonstudio.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
Faeriecon in Philadelphia will be the next time coming up <br/>
in the near future, there is admission for the event, but <br/>
if you get in touch with me ahead of time as a vendor I <br/>
have passes, so come on by! The Good Faeries Masquerade <br/>
Ball and the Bad Faeries Masquerade Ball are not to be <br/>
missed! www.faeriecon.com<br/>
