From what I've been reading here and on Atlas Quest, it's VERY unclear whether this policy actually is in effect.  And apparently someone actually has a fairly recent letter from the DEP Commissioner at the time that the policy would NOT go into effect. <br/>

Sorry if this muddies the water, but there's apparently A LOT of confusion.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-830088770">I had a nice conversation yesterday with the Supervisor of State Land in the Forestry department at Connecticut DEP.  He told me there is no policy and no permit required for planting letterboxes in State Forests in Connecticut.  Using common sense - boxes should not be placed in restricted areas, in stone walls in Glastonbury and Portland (rattlesnakes), or streams.  Any box that is in a dangerous place such as the edge of cliffs is not allowed as someone could get hurt.  If boxes are found in these areas, they will be removed, but the DEP isn't specifically looking at where letterboxes are being planted.  Boxes that are lost due to controlled burning or other foresting going on will be at the expense of the owner, not DEP.  <br/>
<br/>
Gillette Castle is a State Park.  The supervisor of this park had issues with some boxes that were planted in a restricted and dangerous area, so he wanted to know where others boxes were in the park.  When I spoke with him, he didn't even ask me the name of the box, but gave me the OK for where I placed it as it was away from the area in question.  <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully this clears up any questions.<br/>

Those of you who've had problems and those who just want more info might want to check out the thread "DEP Policy" on the Connecticut Board of Atlas Quest.  In response to what I was seeing here and some questions asked of me at a recent Letterboxing 101 talk, I decided to post this issue there.  From what I've been reading here and on Atlas Quest, it's VERY unclear whether this policy actually is in effect.  And apparently someone actually has a fairly recent letter from the DEP Commissioner at the time that the policy would NOT go into effect. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if this muddies the water, but there's apparently A LOT of confusion.<br/>

He has asked me to contact all placers and let you know that if you don't call him and speak to him, there is a very good chance that he will pull your box(es)and they will disappear. He is especially concerned with the ones on the river side of the park, and any that are placed beyond signs concerning closed areas of the park. He says there is a DEP policy for all CT parks stating that permission is needed to plant in the parks, and that supervisors need to be told where the boxes are. He is a "by the book" kind of guy. I told him that I have no control over other boxers, as to whether they will call or not, but he is using the boxes as leverage--they may just go missing.

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1492083479">I think it's a fair issue on the part of park managers.  I say that from the<br/>
perspective of a park manager and trail volunteer - the people and groups<br/>
that give and not just take are always given a higher priority and seen in a<br/>
better light. It's not just the State parks, but also local parks and<br/>
especially CFPA, who has an issue with geocaches and letterboxes on many of<br/>
their Blue-Blazed trails because much of the network crosses private<br/>
property and they do not have permission from the landowner for this<br/>
activity (this is a bigger problem with geocaches that are off-trail).   I<br/>
spoke with someone once (not from CFPA but very close to them) who said "we<br/>
always remove those things when we find them, they're not supposed to be<br/>
there." <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had an idea awhile ago that I've been mulling around.  The Quinnipiac<br/>
Trail (the State's oldest hiking trail, c. 1929) is in various stages of<br/>
neglect and they have been discussing whether or not to abandon the first<br/>
several miles because of this.  These first few miles are located within<br/>
Quinnipiac River State Park in North Haven, adjacent to (but on the other<br/>
side of the highway from) Sleeping Giant State Park.  Basically, they cannot<br/>
keep up with heavy plant growth that obscures the trail during the summer<br/>
along the river, including poison ivy and Japanese Knotweed. I mentioned<br/>
this to Rob Butterworth from CFPA awhile back and he said they are always<br/>
looking for volunteers to help.  CFPA has a system where they have Trail<br/>
Managers for various sections of the trails.  Perhaps we could have a CT<br/>
Letterboxers group adopt the first section of trail and save it?  That kills<br/>
several birds with one stone - pleasing the State Parks people, pleasing the<br/>
CFPA people, and helps save the most historical trail in the entire state. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a lot of trail maintenance experience, as well as experience<br/>
pulling/spraying poison ivy and other invasive species.  Anyone interesting<br/>
in something like that? Here's my blog post from the trail<br/>
