Trout Brook Valley #4: The Burgundian Castle is 40 (though 41 and 42 <br/>

Dave and I haven't planted that many - We have a hard enough time doing maintenance on those we have planted. <br/>
But we are(or I should say Dave is) doing our part to up the # of HH's out there. People were lamenting that they weren't finding enough of them! <br/>
