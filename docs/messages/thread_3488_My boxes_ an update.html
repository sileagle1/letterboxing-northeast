AQ. The boxes are still listed there for logging purposes for now. My main concern was the <br/>
way the natural areas were being treated by the hordes of summer visitors we have on MDI. <br/>
Secondary concern was the treatment of my boxes and my overall main reason was how I <br/>
want to play at letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I will be printing out regional clue booklets and will gladly pass these on to anyone who asks. <br/>
I am also involved in the LOG, so my clues will certainly be available!<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who plans on a visit to downeast Maine should drop me a line. I'd love to meet you <br/>
and pass on clues to my old and new boxes!<br/>
