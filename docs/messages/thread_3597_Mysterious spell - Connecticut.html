I knew in my heart that the Entwives were not lost, but hiding in Hobbiton.  Seems a small village has appeared with mushroom umbrellas, waterfalls of rocks, pine cone trees, and new tiny homes have been built with teeny walkways connecting them and so much more.  The creatures were either away on vacation or sleeping in their hobbit holes - none could be seen.  If you're ever in the area, check it out.  Most Big Folk and Muggles might not even notice...<br/>
<br/>
  Enjoy!<br/>
