box (#2) of my Native American Trees and Traditons is missing.  I <br/>
went to look for it this afternoon, and indeed, it was not in it's <br/>
spot... I found some of it's contents dragged and chewed across the <br/>
grove of spruces at the top of the hill...  this is what it looks <br/>
like now:<br/>

<br/>
I searched and searched for the actual stamp so I could replace the <br/>
box...  but only found the bags, box, stamp pad and tiny chewed pages <br/>
of the log book.  The animal apparantly took the whole bag/box up the <br/>
hill from the boulder at 200 degrees, straight into the grove, <br/>
chewing parts along the way.  I also found a pair of scissors and an <br/>
old milk jug severly chewed on, so this is a favorite spot of this <br/>
animal to bring found items (I would say a coyote from the size of <br/>
the scat in the area).   <br/>
<br/>
Please I beg all of you boxers new and old alike, please put <br/>
something HEAVY on top of the box.  No plans to recarve this stamp, <br/>
it was truely one of a kind.<br/>

Tomorrow is the most important thing in life. Comes into us at midnight very clean. It's perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands. It hopes we've learned something from yesterday. <br/>
