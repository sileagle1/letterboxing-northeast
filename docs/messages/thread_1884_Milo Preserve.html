 The Foxy Fox Clues and The Touring the Tors  I gave hint of the time<br/>
it would take to the boxes.  Well,  one was planted in dry beautiful<br/>
weather and I zoomed in and the other was planted in deep snow and I<br/>
dragged in   So --  please check the clues again. thanks.  Sorry if I<br/>
caused anyone trouble.  As a help,  the Tor comes before the Foxy Fox<br/>
and they are both short walks.<br/>
Enjoy them <br/>
