                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-631612102">Hi, I've been away the last couple weeks and on returning today <br/>
realized that my e-mail was acting up. I'm going to reply to a couple <br/>
e-mails sent to me that did get through, yet I don't seem to be <br/>
having much luck responding to. I would not want anyone to think I <br/>
have been ignoring them.<br/>
Mike, I'm glad to hear that you found "Stix Varia", thanks for the <br/>
compliment on the stamp. I'm "Happy" to hear someone finally picked <br/>
up the surprise waiting there. Phyto, Lori and myself are doing just <br/>
fine, thanks for asking. We are looking forward to seeing you guys on <br/>
the 29th. Chris, at this time we don't see anyway we could swing <br/>
making the Dartmoor trip. We have a grandchild on the way and will be <br/>
spending our savings on a trip to Florida to visit her. Connie, I <br/>
will answer your questions when I get my troubles sorted out. But <br/>
yes, we did find TC's " BeeHive"!  :)<br/>
<br/>
I also usually receive e-mail notification when new people sign up <br/>
for this list and was sad when it looked to me that there were no new <br/>
members in the last week. I'm greatly relieved to see that not only <br/>
are there new members but we have reached the 100 members mark. With <br/>
the list having been "outed" on the big list we will probably see a <br/>
swell in membership here, as Phyto pointed out.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks All!!<br/>
