all the boxes at Harkness State Park in CT were pulled?  We were 0 for <br/>
9.  Maybe they are temporarily missing?  I hope so.  We were really <br/>
looking forward to finding them.  Still it was a beautiful day!  It is <br/>
the first time we have been there, where we didn't visit the water!  <br/>
We looked for Music Woman's Harkness State Park set,the Domedreamer's <br/>
Pride and Prejudice, and the newest Baseball Boy by the Family Light, <br/>
which was planted in April.  Any ideas what happened to them?<br/>

I may be down there tomorrow evening, and I was going to pull them and retire them.  If you would like to meet me at Harkness after they close the "toll" booth, I'll hunt mine down for you and you can stamp in before I pull them.  I also need the newest box there so I'll be hunting too ;-).<br/>
