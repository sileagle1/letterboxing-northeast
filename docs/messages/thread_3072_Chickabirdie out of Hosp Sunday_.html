While we've never met, I'm still sorry to hear about your family's <br/>
misfortunes.  I trust everything is now on the "up and up"; y'all need <br/>
a (GOOD) break.  <br/>
As an aside, I'm a pessimist:  things will always get worse before they <br/>
get better...  Now having said (posted?) that, even I think you've <br/>
turned the corner, I hope.<br/>

  So sorry to hear that Chickabirdie has been in the hospital.  I'm hoping that her release tomorrow means she is well on the road to recovery from whatever it was that put her there to begin with.  Do you think she would like to receive some Get Well Wishes from fellow Boxers?  I wish we could send YOU some hugs!  When it rains, it pours, huh?   Hang in there, Chuck.   <br/>
