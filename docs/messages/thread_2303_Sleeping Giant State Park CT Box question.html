Don't know the trail color but you go past the main entrance heading East and take like the second left to the end of the road where there is a trail head. This trail borders the flat horse trail for a while and I think it's along the back of the giant. You'll find a series with birds that were fairly flat, with slow inclines that should work. We did that with Funhog in June in 95 degree weather and the Hog's foot in a cast thingie. At work so I don't have a trail map or box names.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

Now you are talking,  The Sleeping Giant is a great place for all ages.  <br/>
If you have never been,  and have children in your group,  you should by <br/>
all means take the Tower Trail up to the tower.  There are boxes at the <br/>
top as well as along the way.  There is no climbing involved,  and a <br/>
wonderful adventure at the top.  I have been hiking children up the <br/>
tower trail for over 50 years and every time it was a fun hike with <br/>
smiling faces.  I am sure with the map you have and the clues you pull <br/>
off, you will be able to catch quite a few lettrboxes not far off the <br/>
Tower trail on  the other color trail.  I would suggest you go to the <br/>
tower first , get those boxes there and as you start down,  pick up the <br/>
others you might have energy for.<br/>
My two cents.<br/>
Have fun<br/>

We will be encouraging letterboxers to carpool at this event. For the most part the boxes will be drivebys (with a twist) so there won't be a lot of walking. <br/>
I just checked out roomrates at the Super 8 Motel in Leominster on www.travelhero.com and came up with rooms for about $75 dollars. There were additional discounts for AAA members.<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

While I cannot speak to the area hotels, you can contact the lazy<br/>
letterboxer. I'm sure she'll read this and get back to you real soon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As far as car pooling - with the price of gas and to help minimize the<br/>
amount of cars in the area - we will be encouraging as much car pooling as<br/>
possible. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We'd love to see you attend since we can use ALL the help we can get to find<br/>
Percival! Poor Luvvy hasn't been the same since his departure!<br/>

&gt;   Can you recommend a nice nearby hotel that isn't too expensive?  <br/>
&gt; (nice =<br/>
&gt;   Clean and safe for under $100 if possible.....) I have some<br/>
&gt;   semi-serious joint issues and if I'm going to box, I probably won't  <br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt;   able to also drive the 3 (?) hours each way to/from Albany on the  <br/>
&gt; same<br/>
&gt;   day without putting myself seriously out of commission for a  <br/>
&gt; while......<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Thanks!<br/>
