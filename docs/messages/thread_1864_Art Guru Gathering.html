Phyto and Isosceles will be on the road, so it's difficult to bring<br/>
prepared foods. But....we can certainly provide munchies, fruit or<br/>
other snacky bits that do not involve heating or preparation. <br/>
<br/>
Who else is coming???!!! I heard central maine (aka Bangor area) is<br/>
supposed to get hit with another storm this weekend, so it's not<br/>
looking good for our drive back. Awww shucks, stranded near Portland -<br/>
oh - that's really too bad ;)<br/>

would tack it on here too. Sangfroid and I really want to go but<br/>
seeing as I am ginormously pregnant and that we are going down to Mass<br/>

some gathering one of these days.<br/>

I trust the Maine Art Guru is on for this Sunday, April 3rd.  Dan <br/>
and I are driving up Sat from RI and staying in Scarborough.  I hope <br/>
that there is room for us. We'll bring something for the potluck.<br/>

I am sorry about the instant message thing.  I have never done it before and am not <br/>
sure how it works.  Yes the Gathering is still on.  No big snow storm this time and <br/>
with the rain the past few days helped the snow level go down a bit faster.  I am <br/>
very excited to see everyone and please e-mail with any questions.  And yes thanks <br/>
for the reminder again about it being a pot luck lunchen.  This will be great fun.<br/>
