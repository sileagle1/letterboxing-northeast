Monster Mash.<br/>
<br/>
I went to this event for the fun of it, not looking to rack up any <br/>
big numbers or anything, but I can't believe it -<br/>
<br/>
The MMM put me *precisely* at PFX500!!<br/>
<br/>
A huge thank you to all that participated in the planning, execution <br/>
(pun intended), and the all in all fun that was The Mansfield Monster <br/>
Mash.<br/>
<br/>
It was so wonderful to see old friends and meet up with new ones as <br/>
well.  I had the time of my life!<br/>
