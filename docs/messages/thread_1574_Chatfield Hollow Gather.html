secure our gather plans and finish planting. <br/>
<br/>
The gather time is 10-4 at Chatfield Hollow State Park on Route <br/>
80 in Killingworth, CT. The raindate is Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
You will need to park outside the gate and make the short walk <br/>
to the pavilion on your left. Please bring a food item to share and <br/>
a log for our campfire! Lou is making chowder, I will have a beef <br/>
stew warming on the camp stove.<br/>
<br/>
You will want to wear some orange if you do any of the boxes that <br/>
are in the forest (green area on Chatfield DEP map), since there <br/>
is hunting in there except on Sunday. <br/>
<br/>
Bring your Killingworth clues! There will be more posted this <br/>
week by us and others. There will be at least 50 boxes in the <br/>
park, at least 6 just for the day, plus an event stamp. I have heard <br/>
from Dr. Hawley Griffen that he will be there. To get his personal <br/>
stamp, ask the right person (a different person than at the <br/>
mystery gather!). <br/>
<br/>
We look forward to seeing our letterboxing friends!</div>
