                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1645913730">Hey, I was wondering if anyone has done this box in <br/>
Mansfield/Mansfield Depot lately. Callie and I went to the park and <br/>
did several boxes there today. While looking for the Merrow Park box <br/>
we found the stone wall with the 5x5 endcap, looked under it for any <br/>
place where a stone could be pulled out that was big enough for a <br/>
box, and came up empty. We then looked under all the small stones <br/>
that we could pull out under the cap at the junction of the wall, and <br/>
still came up empty. Any other suggestions? We were able to find the <br/>
Three wizzards, Callie got the Last Day (I already had it), <br/>
Willimantic River Trail, Champlion's General Store, Thank You, and <br/>
the Mansfield Depot Train Trestle. I left Driftwood hitch hiker at <br/>
one of those places, too. Yesterday we had a great day finding <br/>
Journey into Imagination. We got soaked in the only place in <br/>
Connecticut that I think it poured! Oh well, had fun anyway. And <br/>
finally found all the boxes after retracing our steps. Any help with <br/>
Merrow Park would be appreciated. <br/>
