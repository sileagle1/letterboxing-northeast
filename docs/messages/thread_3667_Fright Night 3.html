<br/>
WOW! What an amazing accomplishment! I'm in awe of the masterfully executed<br/>
&amp; abundantly fun Fright Night gathering. I can't imagine how you could<br/>
possibly top this next year...you've really raised the bar for yourselves!<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
Kudos, and thank you!!<br/>

There was SO MUCH going on at FN3, it was impossible to see and do <br/>
everything!  If you couldn't make it, you missed some incredible <br/>
creative activities planned by the most ambitious of event <br/>
organizers... here's a sampling!<br/>
<br/>
*Walking into the event, being greeted by the Kokopellian himself, <br/>
followed by the 7+ foot tall Jack Skellington (Mr. Muddy Paws)!<br/>
<br/>
*Picking up the expertly created color clue brochure created by <br/>
GollyGee (who was unfortunately not present on Saturday) and <br/>
realizing that there was NO WAY that all those boxes could possibly <br/>
be found in one day!<br/>
<br/>
*Seeing a room full of costumed folks who had come from far and wide <br/>
to celebrate together, and the mad frenzy of exchanging taking <br/>
place.  The air got really charged as one after another, the mystery <br/>
guests were revealed...is that the Deadly Letterboxer, or was it <br/>
David from Team NH?  What?  Someone was KUKU enough to fly out this <br/>
way from Oregon?  OMG, is that Nancy Drew (aka Amanda from Seattle) <br/>
and Green Tortuga (aka Ryan)?  I am sure I missed many others, my <br/>
apologies, but the Word Wraith was busy Scrabbling letters to <br/>
attempt to defend her title...<br/>
<br/>
*Gamers, take your Stations!  Rattle dem Bones with Wildcat <br/>
Dave...Viva Lost Vegas with Travelers4...spin the Wheel of <br/>
Misfortune with Vanna and Jack (MuddyPaws)...Toss those rings on the <br/>
Gravestones with Cooties...and a working Zultan machine? <br/>
<br/>
*Is that Orion and Ron setting up a studio for another Frightful <br/>
Video Podcast???  <br/>
<br/>
*What are we eating?  Is it Kitty Litter or dessert?  At least no <br/>
flaming lanterns were encountered in the search for the spookiest <br/>
culinary dish.<br/>
<br/>
*Time to head out on a road adventure?  I'm not ready to leave yet!  <br/>
Go Go GO!!!  Had to detour for Scrapbooking and Coffee, but the <br/>
trail of terror continued through the town of Gorham, ME.  Were <br/>
there boxes at the domicile of the Kokopellian?  It was raining so <br/>
hard that I missed them!  Onward to our final destination...at the <br/>
MK family lands where a welcoming Bonfire awaited with fire-roasted <br/>
New England Red Hotdogs!<br/>
<br/>
*The Haunted Trail!!!  The most incredibly haunted letterboxing <br/>
jaunt ever...a most ghoulish marvel of engineering created by Giddy <br/>
and the Muddy Paws did not disappoint!  Cooties spaced out the <br/>
groups so that each group had a maximum spooky experience!  <br/>
<br/>
On this warm humid night with a full moon overhead, the ambiance <br/>
could not have been better.  We started off down the muddy track not <br/>
knowing what to expect...glow sticks?  Reflective tape?  Nope.  How <br/>
about a tented maze lit by blacklight? Yup.  A full-sized crashed <br/>
vehicle with a glowing skeleton at the wheel?  Yup.  A collapsed <br/>
crypt with a stamp inside a funky lit skull? Check.  Full-sized <br/>
scarecrows...being led into the woods by creepy moaning <br/>
sounds...encountering Jack Skellington's eerily glowing brain...the <br/>
field of lit Jack-o-Lanterns? The most amazing crypt-keeper's <br/>
playground...how about encountering a freshly dug grave complete <br/>
with flaming lantern post, headstone, and having to dig for the <br/>
box?  The adventure continues...possible death by falling in a mine <br/>
shaft...or death by fright at the antics of the Kokopellian!  How <br/>
about crossing a bridge over lava?  The steam was pretty frightful.  <br/>
And if all that wasn't enough, last stop...the Cemetery!  This was <br/>
the creme-de la creme of the ghoulish adventure: gravestones, eerie <br/>
colors glowing in the fog...skeletons haunting the graves, spiders, <br/>
floating ghouls!  Yikes, where's the box?  IN THE COFFIN!!!  With <br/>
the red-glowing skeleton!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Did we survive?  Barely.  This was the most creative letterboxing <br/>
effort I have ever seen! <br/>
<br/>
Thank you to all of you CRAZY BOXERS!!!  Truly, it was an amazing <br/>
day (or 3, depending on how crazy you were).<br/>
