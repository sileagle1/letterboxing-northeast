and thankyous for Boxing by the Bay.  The clues were<br/>
amazing and our little spider still has "his" treasure<br/>
map and woe betide anyone who tries to move it. :)<br/>
<br/>
We, alas, were also plagued with car trouble.  We<br/>
spent most of the day in the parking lot at AutoZone<br/>
fixing the brakelines of our car.  We are forever<br/>
indebted to the good people there for going way past<br/>
above and beyond to help us poor travelers.  With<br/>
their help we were able to eventually stroll into the<br/>
park to see our boxing friends.<br/>
<br/>
Although, we missed many, we were welcomed and<br/>
befriended by those still there.  Our day truly got a<br/>
lot brighter and we had a wonderful time boxing into<br/>
the evening.  A huge THANKYOU to Phyto and Iscoceles<br/>
for helping to turn a horrible day into a good one. <br/>
The boxing and the friends old and new were wonderful<br/>
as always.<br/>
<br/>
We finished out the rest of our Maine vacation without<br/>
mishap and returned home with many new boxes and<br/>
stories to go with them.  We look forward to boxing in<br/>
Maine, again.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!!!!<br/>
