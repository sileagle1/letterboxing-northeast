the elephants on the southern safari, and all are well. We also got <br/>
My Favorite Wild Things, and The Totem Pole. The stamps for My <br/>
Favorite Wild Things are very nice. I was very glad that I had Callie <br/>
with me to send over the second bridge to collect the Totem Pole box. <br/>
The bridge is just about unpassable except to climb down to some <br/>
rocks and up the side of the bank. The stamp was worth the trouble, <br/>
though. We still could not find Are You Stumped. This was our second <br/>
try. I guess we really are stumped!! Thanks to Chuck &amp; Molly and <br/>
Irish Mum for a great day!<br/>
