Dancing Bubs is bone dry and still in tact, not a lot of visitors,<br/>
except for someone out of state (Michigan) on Monday the 4th. Nice to<br/>
see that Bangor does get visitors from time to time :)<br/>
<br/>
Phyto and Isosceles maintain some boxes on Mackworth Island in<br/>
Falmouth. Remembering Garry has been missing for quite some time and<br/>
Island View has now been officially confirmed missing. We plan to<br/>
replace both of these boxes soon as well as to replace the (quite<br/>
full) logbook of Fairy Homes!<br/>
<br/>
The Chocolate Church box in Bath has been pulled for a new logbook and<br/>
will be in place at some point. I'll post when that is done.<br/>
<br/>
Spring is in full swing.<br/>
Let's see some NEW BOXES IN MAINE!!!!!<br/>
