found it at Green Falls Pond, Voluntown, Ct.  I haven't replaced it<br/>
yet, but I will soon.  Interesting that this is the first hitch hiker<br/>
I have found since my "name" is runicwitch and the Raidho symbol is my<br/>
stamp as well.  I have thought of doing a rune series...curious, has<br/>
it already been done?</div>
