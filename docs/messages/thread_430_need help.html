My first plant faced the same problem:  planted in one county but <br/>
more easily accessed, and located nearest to a town in another <br/>
county.<br/>
<br/>
If the clue is posted at LbNA:<br/>
<br/>
Go to "Member Services", and left-click the link.<br/>
<br/>
Find "Manage Your Letterboxes", go to "Your Letterboxes (#)", and <br/>
click on that link.  You should see a list of all the letterboxes <br/>
you have planted and listed on LbNA.  Note the links under your <br/>
planted boxes that will allow you to Edit or Archive your boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Go to the box for which you want to change the county listed in the <br/>
clue, and click on "Edit".<br/>
-Find the "County" listing, clicking on the county name or the <br/>
little blue arrow to the right of it will trigger a drop-down menu.<br/>
-Select the county you want to display in your clue.<br/>
-Scroll to the very bottom of the page, and click "Submit changes". <br/>
<br/>
The correct county should now be displayed in your clue.  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry the post is so long, I hope it helps solve your problem.<br/>

Now I'm not so sure if it's simple.  If you look up my "Alabama's <br/>
Getaway" Lb on LbNA, I have it listed in Tolland County where the <br/>
box is planted, however the nearest town in the clue lists North <br/>
Windham, CT. It just happens to be easier to access the box from <br/>
Windham County, and I had no trouble posting the listing at the <br/>
time.  <br/>
It sounds like there maybe more going on there than I know about if <br/>
you are still having problems.  Hopefully the webmasters, or others <br/>
more knowledgeable than I can fix it for you.<br/>
