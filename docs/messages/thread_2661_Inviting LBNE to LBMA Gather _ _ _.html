<br/>
It is still early in 2006, but already there have been gathers and BD parties.  Before we all get too busy on the trails I would like to invite the LBNE Letterboxing Community to come join us in Delaware for "It's Just a Game" on Oct 8 2006. <br/>
<br/>
You may not be making long range plans this soon, but I am seeking carvers for stamp delivery by April 1 so I can get them plotted and clues written - after all there will be 50+ boxes for this gather in the box starved regions of Kent County. That is not to say you wouldn't have to travel through all those New Castle County boxes to reach Killens Pond State Park.<br/>
<br/>
Come over and visit for all the details and the list of stamp categories that will be needed :<br/>

<br/>
What do you want me to carve?<br/>
<br/>
You caught me at a good time.  I just finished carving three boxes for <br/>
the Ice Scream Event in April, and my current carving "to do" list are <br/>
for boxes that won't be planted until the spring.<br/>
<br/>
Bring it on!<br/>
