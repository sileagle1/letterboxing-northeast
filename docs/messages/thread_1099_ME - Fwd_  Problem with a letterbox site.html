Hello,<br/>
    My name is Jay McIntosh and I am the Park Manager at Lamoine <br/>
State Park<br/>
in the town of Lamoine Maine. I am having some difficulty with a site<br/>
apparently located here within the park since 8/12/02. First I would <br/>
have<br/>
thought that those locating the box might have asked permission. <br/>
They did<br/>
not. Those that come here to locate the box are upset when they are <br/>
asked to<br/>
pay the entrance fee. This is not mentioned in the clues. <br/>
Instructions<br/>
leading to the box direct people through the campground. This is an <br/>
area of<br/>
the park reserved for campers and their guests only. Directions to <br/>
the box<br/>
mention a bridge that was removed 2 years ago.<br/>
    I would like to see either the box removed or the errors <br/>
corrected.<br/>
Thank you for any assistance you may offer and feel free to call me <br/>
at AC<br/>
(207) 667-4778.<br/>

good reason not to include the park name in the title of your box.<br/>

think it is listed under Ellsworth, Maine near Mount Desert Island<br/>
(Bar Harbor, etc) . It seems to have been hidden by visitors, so I<br/>
doubt they have checked up on it since it was placed.<br/>
<br/>
I have not found that box, (I assumed I would be charged so I was<br/>
waiting until winter when it is free) It is listed on the LBNA site.<br/>
