other boxers. I recovered a box today that I had already moved once<br/>
before in it's short lifespan of only 2 months. It became obvious as<br/>
the leaves dropped and the rain began pouring that the downward sloped<br/>
hillside of this location was due for some saturation. Needless to say<br/>
the rooted stump where this box was originally located became an empty<br/>
void for rain to fill. <br/>
<br/>
Thus, I moved this box slightly higher and used a more effective rock<br/>
cover. Thinking that this would help I blindly left the box. As most<br/>
snow has vanished and subsequent melting and runoff has occured I came<br/>
back today and noticed that this particular spot must be built on<br/>
glacial marine mud as it is sickly wet and not apt to dry until June!!<br/>
<br/>
The moral of this story is: check out the box during different<br/>
seasons. As most trail maintenance people would agree also - check it<br/>
out during the rain - even if you're not apt to plant a box during the<br/>
rain, make note of where the rain runs off so that you can note to<br/>
yourself where NOT to put a box - ie: in spots where rain and<br/>
meltwater will collect.<br/>
<br/>
I've learned my lesson with this. One final note is that when placing<br/>
a box in a location that you're unsure of perhaps anchor the box and<br/>
use flat rocks for drainage underneath as well as on top. What's below<br/>
the box seems to be just as important as what's on top covering it in<br/>
my experience.<br/>
