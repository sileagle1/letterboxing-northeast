replaced the three boxes in this series. I left as much of the <br/>
original material in as possible but all three stamps are new and in <br/>
new locations (along the same trail) so for former finders "I think" <br/>
these should qualify as new F's.<br/>
The Lion, on the same trail is alive and will be well as soon as I <br/>
get out there with a dry log book.<br/>
