going to do that box Friday morning on my way down to Narragansett!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, KellyBean, you have my deepest sympathy.  It really hurts when a <br/>
box goes missing - especially your very first one!<br/>
<br/>
Don't give up hope, girlfriend.  If you decide to recarve and replant <br/>
the box, call me.  I'm available Monday - Thursday during the day.  I <br/>
know you have a prior commitment for Friday mornings.  I'll come down <br/>
and help you with the hiding spot.  It can still be near the same <br/>
place, but I've got some clever ways of hiding that I'd love to share <br/>
with you.<br/>

The first one was planted specifically for the event. It was originally planted in the end of a dead log. We ended up finding it about 20 feet away in a different log. <br/>
<br/>
The second one has been in the area for a little while. The owner was notified that it may be missing and when he went to look for it, couldn't find it. It wasn't until he went back a second time that he finally found it slightly moved from his original placement.<br/>
