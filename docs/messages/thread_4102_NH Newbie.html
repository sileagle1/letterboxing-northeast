Welcome to letterboxing. First I need to ask where central is? Not that it really matters, but I haven't found anyone that you should watch out for on the trails. Of course, I am a man so I don't have those fears that you might have. What fears I have around these parts are the 50 lb raccoons that might fall out of the trees when you least expect it!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-906931816">I've been hiking on trails by myself for nearly 40 years and never had any<br/>
problems.  On the other hand, I've broken two ankles running out to the<br/>
school bus (on separate occasions) and there's a neighbor guy that's<br/>
stalking me when I walk down the street (he's been in jail for stalking).<br/>
Generally speaking, the more remote the trail, the safer I feel.  It's the<br/>
urban trails and parking lots that seem the least safe. -Trailhead Tessie<br/>
