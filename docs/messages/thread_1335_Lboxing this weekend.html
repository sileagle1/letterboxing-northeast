</span></blockquote>I will hopefully be heading out to do 3 of the Connecticut State <br/>
Forest Series, there are 30 in total as well as at least one of the <br/>
CT State Stamps where one can be found in each county. I am having a <br/>
heck of a time with the clue for the one in Hartford County, the CT <br/>
State Library didn't even call me back on it yet lol. I would also <br/>
like to get out to Old New Gate Prison for the 4 boxes out there. <br/>
This being a new addiction I really need to figure out how I am going <br/>
to get this house clean during Monday thru Friday so it leaves my <br/>
weekends open for boxing.<br/>
