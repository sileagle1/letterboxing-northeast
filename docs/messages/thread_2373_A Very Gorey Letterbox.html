I have just replaced this box originally placed by the lazy<br/>

From route 6A turn north on Homestead Lane, across from #365, The<br/>
Friday Club. Stay on this road a short way until you come to Kingsbury<br/>
Road, go right on Kingsbury for about a block. You will come to a<br/>
small parking lot on the right and see a sign that says Yarmouthport<br/>
Walking Trail. Enter the trail and stay on this main trail (you will<br/>
see a trail veer off to the right, do not take this trail) until you<br/>
come to a handrail that leads down a set of "stairs". At the<br/>
bottom of<br/>
the stairs, walk about 11 steps to a thin hallway of trees going<br/>
uphill. Walk up in between these trees and you'll find yourself on a<br/>
flat island above most of the land around you. Walk into the woods<br/>
and to the right you will see a porcupine pine. Head towards this and<br/>
stop about 10 feet before it. Turn toward the left and look for the<br/>
oak with the arm shaped like Cape Cod. A Very Gorey Letterbox is<br/>
hidden beneath a couple of gnarly sticks under "Yarmouth." Is there<br/>
any doubt who's inside? Carefully re-cover and continue on your<br/>
way<br/>
around the trail or back the way you entered.<br/>
Funhog's Heron's Haven Letterbox is also located on this<br/>
walking trail.<br/>
