<br/>
<br/>
It looks like our Dartmoor trip in September is actually coming to <br/>
fruition. Sue and I will be joined by 9 others [may increase to 12]on <br/>
our trip to England in mid September!<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if there were any letterboxers who would like to have <br/>
one of their letterboxes or hitchhikers taken with us and planted in <br/>
England. You can email me offlist if you have an interest. You will <br/>
just have to prepare it as you normally would and mail it or give it <br/>
to me if you plan to be at one of the upcoming gatherings. Our group <br/>
will plant it on the moors and take a picture of it's final resting <br/>
place that we can post on our website. In addition, we are planning a <br/>
gathering in Dartmoor with fellow British letterboxers and will be <br/>
sure they also stamp into your logbooks. If you want your hitchhiker <br/>
returned to the US after our trip, we can do that also.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

Be careful  what you ask of us CT letterboxers.  When I was going to <br/>
Utah, I just casually mentioned how they had so few boxes there and WOW <br/>
did our family come through.  I had one whole BIG suitcase full of boxes <br/>
to share and it made them very happy and us very proud . Crossing the <br/>
pond with a suitcase full of tupperware might be something to explain to <br/>
the security<br/>
