<br/>
Sue &amp; I will be hosting a gathering in West Dover, VT on June 20th and<br/>
invite you all. It's purpose is to celebrate the importance that VT<br/>
has played in the early days of letterboxing. We're calling it "Back<br/>
to Our Roots."<br/>
<br/>
To read more about it and to sign up, please click the event link<br/>
below and stay tuned to our blog for more details as they develop.<br/>
<br/>
We need volunteers to carve early letterboxing themed stamps or old<br/>
fashioned themed stamps. Please contact us off list. <br/>
