<br/>
One was found on the ground in front of the letterbox<br/>
hidding place, and one was inside the letterbox. The<br/>
people who signed in earlier today only had stamps, &amp;<br/>
no names. So I decided I'd take both HH's and pass<br/>
them along, after I signed them both into the box I<br/>
found them at.<br/>
ROCKET RIDE HH was found on the ground.<br/>
DREAM HH was found in the box.<br/>
Happy Trails<br/>
