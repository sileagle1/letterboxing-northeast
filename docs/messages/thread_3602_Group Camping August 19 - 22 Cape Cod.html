Sandwich, MA.  Check in is Sunday, August 19th at 1PM.  Checkout is Wednesday, August 22nd at 11AM.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone is welcome to join us, there's room for about 25 more and we're down to $3.66 per person<br/>
total for 3 nights of camping. Can't beat that! And the more that come, the lower the cost goes!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There will also be a pot-luck dinner on Monday, August 20th at our group site if you can't camp but<br/>
are interested on joining us for an evening by the fire with food and friends.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please RSVP to either or both on AQ.  If you're going to join us for the pot-luck, let me know what<br/>
you'd like to bring, so we don't wind up with 10 bowls of Ambrosia J<br/>
