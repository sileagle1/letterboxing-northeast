Haven today and on the whole, the series is in an advanced state of <br/>
disrepair. In box #1, the plastic zip bag is broken and the logbook <br/>
was quite damp. The inkpad has also fallen apart. It should be <br/>
brought in to dry for a week or so and re-bagged. This would mainly <br/>
be to avoid the kind of damage that box #2 sustained. The logbook for <br/>
box #2 is pretty much a goner. The metal rings rusted and corroded <br/>
the logbook. In addition, the book was pretty wet to begin with, and <br/>
most of the stamped-in images have washed away leaving the pages <br/>
stuck together. Also, the pen didn't work, the stamp came away from <br/>
it's mount and the cover on the ink pad has somehow managed to become <br/>
sealed shut. Needless to say, I pulled this box for some serious <br/>
repair and will try to get it back out in a timely fashion. Box #3 <br/>
seemed to be in the best condition, aside from me having to wade <br/>
through waist-high prickers to reach it. Still, it could yet benefit <br/>
from something as simple as a new bag or two. People have been <br/>
stamping into this logbook from both sides despite a "this end up" <br/>
marker. Oh well. Upon the return of box #2, I will probably pull the <br/>
first box for those suggested repairs unless, of course, the owner of <br/>
the series beats me to it. Is there still an owner? --NORTHSTAR</div>
