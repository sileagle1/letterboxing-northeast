<br/>
We always say that we're like a big family and now might be a time to help a fellow family member if you so choose.<br/>
<br/>
I need a contact for someone willing to check in on a letterboxer from New Hampshire in the Jackson, NH area. You would only be used if that person doesn't contact me after a day or two. This is a temporary situation for a few months only and would greatly help if the situation arises.<br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate any help I can get. Email me off list.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
