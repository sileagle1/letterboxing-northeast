I was walking at the Trailwood sanctuary in Hampton, CT today, and I <br/>
found what looks like an old letterbox.  It is in a screw top plastic <br/>
bottle.  It only has only one entry in the log book, from 2001.  It has <br/>
a stamp and a coloring marker.  It is located next to a stream near the <br/>
Hired Hand's Monument.  <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone recognize the description or location?  Does anyone know of <br/>
any abandonded boxes there?  The two clues that are on <br/>
letterboxing.org, Trailwoods Back Door and One Honary Cowboy, are in <br/>
different parts of the preserve.  It seems to me there were more boxes <br/>
at Trailwoods at one time.  <br/>
<br/>
If no one recognizes it, I will recover it.  Maybe I will replant it <br/>
with new clues.<br/>

I would leave it alone until the mystery is solved.  I wouldn't adopt it.<br/>
