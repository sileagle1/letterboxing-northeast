Even if the rest of the crowd are veterans and already know each other, they will all be clamoring for this new person's stamp. I would say it's better to go out and actually letterbox a few times before attending a gathering...though you will surely be inspired by all the extremely nice people you will meet at a gathering.<br/>

Probably the BEST start!! That way, you not only get totally inspired and <br/>
psyched to start finding boxes but at gatherings there are usually MANY more <br/>
boxes placed in the immediate area JUST for the gathering so you have all this <br/>
instant gratification for your first time! You also will learn the proper and <br/>
easy way to carve a stamp, what materials to use for you box (there are dozens!) <br/>
etc. <br/>
