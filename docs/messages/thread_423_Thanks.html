Thank you all. Hikerlou will hopefully be happy that we are all<br/>
looking out for him . As the OLD ONE in this group I had planned to<br/>
speak with him this Saturday . Bluebird , Hikerlou, Rubaduc and I are<br/>
hiking together  in Simsbury  Everyone knows I talk on and on about<br/>
the responsibility of hiking alone.  Not a good thing , I preach, and<br/>
try to teach. Coming from you younger ones is perfect and how did you<br/>
get so smart so young ??<br/>
Keep it up !<br/>

One of my troop adults (Who is Hooked on LBing Now) complained my <br/>

difference between magnetic and true north on our area is about 14 <br/>
1/2 degrees N/W. So I'll be adding this little bit of info to my <br/>

post it tonight.<br/>
