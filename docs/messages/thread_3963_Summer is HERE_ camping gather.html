<br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year!!!   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just a reminder that we have begun making reservations for the bi-annual Hudson Valley Letterboxing<br/>
Gather and camping fees are due.  I'll be making reservations by the end of January.  There are only<br/>
4 tent and 7 trailer sites left!   This year the featured season is Summer.  The Spring was held in<br/>
May of 2005 and fall was in October of 2007.  There are only 4 sites left! Camping check-in is after<br/>
3pm Friday, check out by noon Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The day gather will be held onsite Saturday 1 August at Wilcox Park in Stanfordville, NY about 5<br/>
minutes off the Taconic State Parkway.  30 minutes south of I90 and 30 minutes north of I84.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This park has 7 miles of hiking trails, a life guard manned beach, boating, fishing, miniature golf<br/>
and lots of boxes.  In addition to the (approx 20) Summer boxes, the Top Ten Phobias are here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Hope to hear from you soon,<br/>
