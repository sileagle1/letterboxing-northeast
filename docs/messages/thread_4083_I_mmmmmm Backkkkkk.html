With the help of Rubaduc and Gizz, I have been planning a mini "Meet and Greet" in Naugatuck. At last count there were at least 6 boxes and many HH to choose from. Most of these boxes will only be out for this event. <br/>
<br/>
This event will also mark the end of the season for my ice cream shop that will be closing until spring. <br/>

The boxes will be planted from 1 to 7 pm on Wednesday Dec. 16. Clues will be available at the shop. I hope to see some old friends as well and make some new ones!<br/>

HEY!HEY! HEY! Lets get one thing clear, I have never! Nor would I ever euthanize a gerbil or any other rodent. (I leave that to the cats) I have however, had the dubious distinction, along with Dead Duck Chuck, of finding the decaying carcass of one cleverly disguised as a letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
I do however, make the BEST "ice cream you can drink" in town!!<br/>

&gt; We're looking forward to meeting you and talking about rodent euthanasia and/or burial. WE may be the veterinarians, but we hear YOU are  the expert! ;o)<br/>

&gt; Besides Jonah has been looking forward to "ice cream you can drink" (a.k.a. a milkshake) for a while now!<br/>

&gt; After a bit of a hiatus from anything fun and fulfilling and a phase of trying on many different persona's JustBeth is back!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; With the help of Rubaduc and Gizz, I have been planning a mini "Meet and Greet" in Naugatuck. At last count there were at least 6 boxes and many HH to choose from. Most of these boxes will only be out for this event. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This event will also mark the end of the season for my ice cream shop that will be closing until spring. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The boxes will be planted from 1 to 7 pm on Wednesday Dec. 16. Clues will be available at the shop. I hope to see some old friends as well and make some new ones!<br/>
