because of that wondered if it was the ONLY acceptable color. <br/>
Personally, I hate that particular shade:) So, I had a conversation <br/>
with some forest rangers and they told me ANY bright color will do. <br/>
They loved my nice bright yellow fleece jacket, and now that is what <br/>
I always wear during hunting season. So, fellow letterboxers, you DO <br/>
have a choice!  See you on the trail;)   "kstar" <br/>

You do NOT have a choice in some states. <br/>
BLAZE ORANGE is the only acceptable color - at least in Maine I'm <br/>
pretty sure that is the protocol. Even if it's orange, it has to be <br/>
designated as the blaze orange shade or else it is not bright enough. </span></blockquote></div>

Righto Phyto, in fact the color is specified by maine law.<br/>
<br/>
HUNTER ORANGE means a daylight fluorescent orange color with a <br/>
dominant wave length between 595 and 605 nanometers, excitation <br/>
purity not less than 85% and luminance factor of not less than 40%.<br/>
<br/>
The strange part is that only HUNTERS are required to wear this or <br/>
any bright clothing. In Maine, if you are not carrying a firearm, you <br/>
are not bound by these laws. (I don't think hunting for letterboxes <br/>
counts)<br/>
<br/>
However, I would not be caught dead (no pun intended) wearing <br/>
anything else during the maine hunting season. It only takes one <br/>
hunter with a "shoot first, ask questions later" philosophy to ruin <br/>
your whole day. That particular color of orange is not only highly <br/>
visible during broad daylight, but also in the twilight hours, when <br/>
hunters hunting for their last day of the season are really itching <br/>
to shoot a deer, moose, bear, or whatever they can strap to the hood <br/>
of their car and haul back to New Jersey. Even if you plan on only <br/>
being out during the broad daylight hours, you never know when you <br/>
might get delayed until evening, and that bright red jacket of yours <br/>
may begin to look awfully brown...<br/>
<br/>
Better safe than sorry.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-824307062">Orange is only mandatory if you're a hunter in the state of CT, as in <br/>
Maine and most other states. Hikers are not required to wear any <br/>
identifiable color at all. Of course we all know this would be <br/>
irresponsible.  As long as you wear any bright color,  and stay close <br/>
to the trails, you should be fine.  Every season, regardless of <br/>
location, has it's inherent risks. Hiking in and of itself carries <br/>
with it a certain amount of risk. There is always something to be <br/>
afraid of. ( I recall a post from a letterboxer trying to work <br/>
through her overwhelming fear of being attacked ) Use your common <br/>
sense and try not to allow these things to frighten you away from <br/>
doing what you enjoy.  Life is too short.   "D" <br/>
