Mystery Letterbox because I had a very strong feeling I knew right <br/>
where this was and we were headed right past the spot (not a hard sell <br/>
really considering where I thought it was).  As I suspected the clues <br/>
yielded their rewards which were perfect for the day.  <br/>
<br/>
The graveyard also yielded the Pauli HH which is well travelled and <br/>
will be moving on to a new home shortly.  <br/>
<br/>
The VT Graveyard box is in excellent condition but we filled up the <br/>
last page in the log, so it needs a new logbook.  We enjoyed the care <br/>
that had been taken to make the hand made book in this box.  And what <br/>
an excellent choice for a location!  Thanks for guiding us to this <br/>
spot.  We'll need to get back often!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
