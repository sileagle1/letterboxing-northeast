more proud of our state and the thirty state forests we have.  All <br/>
thirty of them welcome letterboxers and indeed have placed a hand carved <br/>
stamp in a letterbox planted in each forest. The symbol of each forest <br/>
has been carved by Sunshine into her  stamp and artfully shows each <br/>
one.This stamp is much more than an Event Stamp  No other state has <br/>
welcomed letterboxing as has CT. . .That is my feeling.<br/>
