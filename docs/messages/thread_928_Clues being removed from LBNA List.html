anything ~ just trying to get some information).  I am wondering <br/>
what the reasoning is for people pulling their clues from the LBNA <br/>
list.  Just curious.  There may be some important bit of information <br/>
I have missed of late.  Since I do not live near lots of other <br/>
letterboxers to swap clues, the LBNA list is my source for clues <br/>
when I am headed out to search.  <br/>
<br/>
Again, I am just curious.<br/>
