                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-506033177">Thus far, it has been my experience that most people use the "contact <br/>
the placer" function/option/button. Let it be known that this works, <br/>
and that most if not all responsible placers will get an email and <br/>
usually respond. Myself included.<br/>
<br/>
However, I recently got a phone call at my home address from the <br/>
local librarian at the Bangor Public Library. I do indeed have a box <br/>
at this location and the librarian contacted me personally in regards <br/>
to a frustrated caller who had contacted the library to inquire about <br/>
that box and many others in the area. I spoke with the librarian who <br/>
was happy to answer those questions, but felt as though they needed <br/>
to be directed to me.<br/>
<br/>
I emplore all folks on this list who plan out of state vacations and <br/>
letterboxing trips to do some research into the area. Maine is known <br/>
for it's boxes being more difficult to find. I don't need to go into <br/>
details about how many weekends I turn up empty handed time and time <br/>
again. My boxes were not intended to be the easiest possible.<br/>
<br/>
Head scratching and perhaps some more investigation is required.<br/>
<br/>
Word to the wise, if there is a HINT (in large letters) contained <br/>
within the lid of a letterbox, then take it as that. All hints in <br/>
future will remain word of mouth and not placed in boxes of mine if <br/>
people can't respect this.<br/>
<br/>
I urge the person whom this email is directed towards to contact me <br/>
as soon as possible. I remain open to discussion and thoughts as to <br/>
how to make this contacting the placer option work better, but it is <br/>
only as efficient as the people who go out to FIND boxes make it as <br/>
such. Use the button, send an email and find out ahead of time. Doing <br/>
a little bit of research ahead of time can save yourself a lot of <br/>
frustration in the long run.<br/>
