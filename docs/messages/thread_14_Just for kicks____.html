description on this board a bit.  (If you're reading this from an e-<br/>
mail subscription, you'll have to go to the main page of the talk <br/>
list to see what I've done.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow....  I don't have any readily available photos available <br/>
relating to the northeast, but I think such a picture would be a <br/>
great addition.  In the meantime, I used a picture of one of my <br/>
stamps until a better replacement could be found.  (I left my stamp <br/>
in there so everyone could see how such a photo would fit in, but I <br/>
dont' want to leave it there permanently.)<br/>
<br/>
But that gave me an idea--if somebody carves a stamp and can e-mail <br/>
me the picture, I can put your stamp image there instead, and that <br/>
could be the finish line for a virtual letterbox introducing this <br/>
talk list.<br/>
