i am new to the group (and to letterboxing) so this is my trial message to<br/>
get through the moderator and participate. i came tro letterboxing<br/>
accidently when i was picking up litter in baxter woods (portland maine)<br/>
and saw a tupperware container lurking under a tall cedar. then i<br/>
remembered an article about letterboxing i had read years ago. what fun,<br/>
how magical!<br/>
<br/>
then on mackworth island i found a letterbox left out. i hid it in the<br/>
vicinity and went to the website to see if i could find clues as to where<br/>
it was supposed to be. the box was placed by PHYTO but i couldn't find any<br/>
clues. i ran into PHYNSTAR (i think that's who) and she said she had taken<br/>
care of it. i'm still interested in finding PHYTO's clues as she seems to<br/>
have placed the boxes in the areas i frequent.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Welcome to the world of letterboxing! The best way to get your hands <br/>
on Phyto's clues would be to contact her through e-mail.  You can <br/>
find her e-mail address under the members section of this talk list <br/>
(her Yahoo profile name is phyto_me).<br/>

Phyto and Isosceles' clues can be found at <br/>
<a href="http://home.gwi.net/~moxie1/Clues/index.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://home.gwi.net/~moxie1/Clues/index.htm</a><br/>
You may also want to check out clues by Casco Bay Painter and Giddy as <br/>
they also have a number of boxes in your area (as do my husband Culex <br/>
and I!)<br/>
Welcome to this fun hobby. It's always nice when a non-letterboxer finds <br/>
a box and instead of trashing it becomes converted! If you're up for an <br/>
interesting time, you might want to try going to the Lakes Region <br/>
letterbox gathering next weekend (e-mail me offline if you want more <br/>
info or search the archives of this talklist).<br/>
