                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1954471825">I found an abandoned LB today at Drumlin Farm - it was just left open<br/>
on one of the deer viewing platforms.  The container was a larger size<br/>
blue-cover rubbermaid serve'n savers.  Inside was only one page of<br/>
the logbook (I assume), and the stamp.  The wood-backed stamp was of a<br/>
deer in the forest (so I'm again assuming the LB was orignally hidden<br/>
nearby) - what is interesting is that the stamp was physically chained<br/>
to the letterbox.  Though tempting (!), I'm guessing water seeped<br/>
through the holes in the container since the interior was damp with<br/>
lots of dark rust.  <br/>
<br/>
So, does anyone know anything about this?  I've done some searching on<br/>
LbNA, this group's posts and the general web with no luck.  I'll be<br/>
more than happy to repackage and replant, or just return (I'm<br/>
relatively close by), let me know.<br/>

Thx, Eyze</div>
