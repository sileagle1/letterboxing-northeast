box in lovely Rockport, MA has been found alive and waiting for new <br/>
visitors! The little frog was just where I left it, only tucked a little <br/>
deeper into its home where it apparently hibernated quite comfortably <br/>
through the long winter. I've added the clues back to LBNA now that it's no <br/>
longer presumed missing.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to Carol and her kids for making the extra effort and rescuing <br/>
this box for others to enjoy.<br/>
