Thanks so much!<br/>

  Subject: [LbNE] Winter boxing drive news :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
  The response to the Hartford County Winter Drive has been overwhelming,<br/>
and<br/>
  that's very exciting!  Here are some things to know if you are planning to<br/>
  attend:<br/>
<br/>
  1.  There have been some adjustments made to the route.  Please eliminate<br/>
  Tobacco Heritage, Cute Cluckers and Spring Has Sprung, due to some missing<br/>
  reports.  :/<br/>
  However, you can add Inland Lobster in Windsor.  :)<br/>
<br/>
  2.  Mark and I have discussed the driving directions, and we don't think<br/>
it's<br/>
  necessary to make box-to-box directions.  Please try to print yourself a<br/>
set<br/>
  of clues.  There should be at least one set per car.  We're going to<br/>
caravan,<br/>
  but in case someone gets seperated from the herd, every car should have a<br/>
list<br/>
  of where we're going.<br/>
<br/>
  3.  There will be an event stamp.  There will also be a stamp for us to<br/>
use<br/>
  to communally stamp into the boxes.  The head count looks to be about 50,<br/>
so<br/>
  using one stamp to stamp in will probably speed up the process, along with<br/>
the<br/>
  fact that many of us already have a lot of these boxes.  :)<br/>
<br/>
  4.  In the case of snow/sleet/all that lovely New England stuff, Mark and<br/>
I<br/>
  will make the decision by 9 pm the night before.  Please check Mark's page<br/>
  (markandsuepepe.blogspot.com) to see if the drive is still on.  So far, it<br/>
looks<br/>
  good!<br/>
<br/>
  Questions?  Ask me.  :)  <a href="mailto:davyschris@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">davyschris@...</a><br/>
<br/>
  Can't wait to see you all!<br/>
<br/>
  Chrissy<br/>
