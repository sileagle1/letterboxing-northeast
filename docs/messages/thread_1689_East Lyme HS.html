third letterbox, I did check the first two this morning while walking <br/>
the chocolate and they're not complete yet. This is a very intriguing <br/>
series to us: our high schooler thinks they may have been placed by <br/>
the Outdoor Pursuits club, who letterbox and climb Mt Monadnock among <br/>
other things dear to our hearts. LobstaLady contacted one of the <br/>
placers and may know more about the origins of the boxes. We love the <br/>
ambiguity of them: they are well done and nicely clued, and the <br/>
planters figured out boxing enough to post them at LbNA, but the <br/>
boxes are incomplete with blank logbooks...very cool mysterious <br/>
stuff! Since they are literally in our back yard, we're keeping a bit <br/>
of an eye on them and will post when/if stamps magically appear.<br/>

them.</div>

the missing stamps.  They are not the boxes that my students planted <br/>
however I know the persons who planted them and will be speaking to <br/>
them tomorrow (1/3/05).  I will let everyone know once they are ready <br/>
and have stamps in them.  However, the boxes that were planted by my <br/>
students (The Wizard, The Witch, and the Horse)when last checked were <br/>
there.  Also, the third box was replanted per the advice of <br/>
lobstalady.  Happy trails!!</div>
