They're calling for 2-5" of rain basically everywhere except the North shore<br/>
and the Cape.   I've already got flood warnings arriving in my email box.<br/>
:-(     Apparently, the front that moves in this afternoon is going to stall<br/>
out and there will be rain on-off all night tonight, all day tomorrow and<br/>
the majority of Sunday.   They're also calling for nasty winds, hail and<br/>
thunderstorms.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to give anyone who is thinking of coming down, a heads-up.<br/>
Hopefully it won't be as nasty as predicted!!!!<br/>
