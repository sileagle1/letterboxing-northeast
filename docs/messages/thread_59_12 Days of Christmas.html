</span></blockquote>Just want to add my  big thanks to Dan and Melissa .  The 12 Days of<br/>
Christmas was a fun series . I completed it in the company of Steve<br/>
and Maddy, and at times Lobsta Lady. We scratched our heads now and<br/>
then and had lots of smiles.  Keep Them coming !!<br/>

&gt;This series sounds like fun, I wish that they could keep it out a week or two longer,it's hard for us northeast hill top people to make it down there to do it.Twice I planed on doing this series and we had a snow storm, and it's dark by the time we get out of work,and now with Christmas shopping theres no way we can get down there until after Christmas.So to Dan &amp; Melissa, Please could you keep it out a little longer.The NeeDeeps </span></blockquote></div>

I didn't plan on taking this series out til New Year's or the weekend after, but let me know if you don't get it by then, I'll leave it out a bit longer.  By the way, has anyone found the box at Civic Triangle or Harkness in the last couple of days?  I had a report that they (well one at least) may be missing.  Some of the hiding places are not the most discreat so it's certainly possible.  I probably won't be able to check it out during the week.  It just gets dark too darn early!  Thanks in advance.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Melissa, I will go check the Harkness one this Sat of Sunday -if it<br/>
does not snow again ! And Yes, I join in the plea to leave out this<br/>
series for a bit longer than you planned.  So many folks were unable<br/>
to get into the area because of the snow storms . It is true that I<br/>
have found them all, and so know how much fun the whole trip is and<br/>
hope that others will have the same enjoyment.  thanks to U2<br/>

Saturday (12/13)!   We had a bear of a time getting the civic <br/>

As for Harkness, it was stuck up in plain view in the middle of a <br/>
bush. Look a little lower, its there! <br/>
