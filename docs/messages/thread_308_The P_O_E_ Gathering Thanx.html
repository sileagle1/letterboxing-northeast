end. Two great meals. Thanks to K-star for the reservations. Thanks <br/>
to Warrior woman for the planning and the exicution, and thanks to <br/>
Team Greendragon for an awesome event stamp!! Who needs the oscars, <br/>
it's you guys who should get the awards. Also, thanks most of all to <br/>
Music woman for the ride. Without your help, i would have spent the <br/>
better part of the day cursing and counting floor tiles. Thank you <br/>
sooooooo much! I hope we can meet up again soon, as a thank-you for <br/>
your help, i have something for you. I hope it's up to your <br/>
standards. All in all, an excellent day. Thanks again to everyone who <br/>
helped put this gathering together. I can't wait until May 2nd. ------<br/>
