<br/>
To obtain my personal traveler you need to tell me my nickname that my Dad used to have for me. <br/>
<br/>
Hints:<br/>
<br/>
He chose the name after I dressed up in an Army camouflage outfit for Halloween. <br/>
My real name is Patricia.<br/>
The nickname is two words and both words rhyme. <br/>
And that's THAT! ;) <br/>
Hope to see you there!!! <br/>
Peppermint Patti :) <br/>

They are so intent on watching the tournament that no one paid any attention to us!<br/>
Great stamps - Thanks Queen B for a great series and a great time at the fair!<br/>
We didn't have time to do all of the other stamps in Lebanon and it's such a neat little town that we will have to return some time. <br/>
Every once in a while Dave and I get to take a foray in to Connecticut from over it's eastern border!<br/>

  Subject: [LbNE] Lebanon Fair Boxes<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Just a thanks to Queen B for planting the Lebanon Fair letterboxes. <br/>
  After almost 2 1/2 years of very rare letterboxing, we actually went <br/>
  to the fair and found this little series! Baby steps! <br/>
<br/>
  Unfortunately, we were there while the horseshoe tournament was going <br/>
  on when we tried to get the ''Ringer'' box, so we missed that <br/>
  one.....but 2 out of 3 isn't a bad day either! <br/>
<br/>
  Garrett's almost 3 now and keeps asking to go hiking in the woods, so <br/>
  hopefully the cooler autumn weather will draw us back the the hobby we <br/>
  love so much. It's taken a real back seat to the game of life the past <br/>
  couple of years, but I think we're going to make an effort to get back <br/>
  into it a little bit......<br/>
<br/>
  Again, Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
  Steve and Heidi (And Garrett) <br/>
