<br/>
How do we begin to thank the Maine crew for such a great gathering?<br/>
Let's start with our hosts - phyto and Isoceles, Nautilus and Culex:<br/>
 the location was the best, the boxes plentiful! Letterboxers in <br/>
Maine may be few but ya sure know how to throw a party! Thanks for <br/>
the wonderful event and the beautiful boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Deb Blanchard: Thanks for the Dartmoor presentation and the time you <br/>
spent with us after. Your tips and suggestions should help make our <br/>
trip a better one.<br/>
<br/>
Amymisha: thanks for arranging the wonderful pre-event gathering meal <br/>
at Federal Jack's. What a diverse group we had assembled but all with <br/>
one common interest!<br/>
<br/>
All of the Maine letterboxers who have planted boxes there: thank <br/>
you, thank you. This has got to be one of the fastest-growing, <br/>
innovative states in terms of new boxes. You may not have tons of <br/>
them like here in CT, but they all seem so well-carved, thought out <br/>
and packaged like the treasures that they are. Sue and I will be back <br/>
to get all of those we missed.<br/>
<br/>
We also want to thank all of those letterboxers who took the time to <br/>
talk to us, exchange a story or two, look for hints on HOW. It was a <br/>
great event.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mark &amp; Sue Pepe<br/>
