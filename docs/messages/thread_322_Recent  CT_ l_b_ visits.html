  So glad to hear the POE Gathering was such fun.  Then again, is <br/>
there such a thing as an un-fun gathering?<br/>
   In Natchaug Forest, Mass. State Stamp and Little House on the <br/>
Prairie are doing just fine! Prairie home is so adorable! NeeDeeps, <br/>
is there a way I could get a list of all the state stamps (not clues <br/>
just stamps) so I can try to  find the whole series? <br/>
  In Ashford, Chuck and Molly's 3 linked "In Search of" boxes <br/>
(Unicorn, Abominable, Grays) are also fine.  That was a heck of a <br/>
hike though, due to trail conditions. I look forward to returning to <br/>
this lovely landtrust parcel when snow and ice are gone. Chuck, I <br/>
would also love a list of all the In Search of boxes so I can try for <br/>
them all. <br/>
  In Hebron, I found Irish Tinker's Peggy Dow.  Your historical <br/>
accounts are fascinating!    The tree you reference as almost dead <br/>
has been cut down, so perhaps you could refer to the huge stump. I <br/>
also visited "I'd Rather Be Letterboxing" series by Irish tinker and <br/>
RTRW. Must have left my thinking cap in the car because I could not <br/>
find l.b. 3.  I shall return to finish the series!! The trail is <br/>
mired in mud and the streams are raging.  Thank goodness for well <br/>
oiled waterproof boots. Box 1 and 2 are just fine, though I counted <br/>
pages in #2 journal and there are about 5 left.  Those journals, as <br/>
well as the stamps are awesome! I love the oldtime effect of the <br/>
leather cover, tan paper book bindings. <br/>
  14 boxes 'til my 300 find.  Happy trails!<br/>
