<br/>
We will miss you at the Winter Gathering. Sue and I love Maine and would<br/>
consider a trip up there.<br/>
<br/>
I will do whatever you need as long as it can be done long distance! Let<br/>
us know when plans are made or contact me offline.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

I would love to attend a Maine mini-gathering in March! It's not a<br/>
long drive to Wells for me, and would be a great cabin fever reliever!<br/>
Count me in. Let me know what I can do to help! Maybe I can bring my<br/>
letterboxing kiddo too, since she missed the August gathering and is<br/>
likely to miss the February one too.<br/>
