                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1915328111">Hi, everyone!  I know I didn't post much in the way of ticket information <br/>
when I first posted my Lucky Stiff clue, because I didn't have it.  So here are <br/>
the specifics, for those who are interested:<br/>
<br/>
June 8-10, 15-17, 22-24<br/>
<br/>
Thursday and Friday $25 admission/byo<br/>
You will be seated at big tables and are allowed to bring munchies, dessert, <br/>
a pizza, whatever your little heart desires.  :)<br/>
Doors open at 7 and the show is at 8.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday is $35 admission/buffet dinner<br/>
Doors open at 6:30, dinner at 7, show at 8.<br/>
<br/>
Tickets can be purchased at www.smarttix.com or by phone at 877-238-5596.  <br/>
Just look under Connecticut and type in the title Lucky Stiff into the search <br/>
box.  I think we're the only play they're handling in CT anyway.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
All performances held at:<br/>
Church of the Good Shepherd, Colt Memorial Ballroom<br/>
155 Wyllys Street<br/>
Hartford, CT  06106<br/>
Directions available at www.montagetheater.com (but don't read the synopsis <br/>
of the play... it gives EVERYTHING away!)<br/>
<br/>
*Very close to the new convention center, if that helps you to navigate!*<br/>
<br/>
More questions, you can email me.  <a href="mailto:Davyschris@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Davyschris@...</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The May Day Lillies are running the spotlight, so you can meet up with them <br/>
too!<br/>
To get the box, just stick around for a bit after the show and we come out <br/>
and greet the audience after we change out of our costumes.  <br/>

  Oh and if you never met Chrissy before she probably should have dead that she is the dead guy (and yes i said guy)<br/>
