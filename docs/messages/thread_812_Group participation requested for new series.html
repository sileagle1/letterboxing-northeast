 Hello to all, <br/>
  I would like to ask your help. I have decided to attempt my first <br/>
letterbox series. The theme will be of Native American Indian tribes. <br/>
This series will be planted along the Mohawk trail in Northwest Conn. <br/>
I thought it would be nice to get stamps sent from the areas of the <br/>
country that are home to various tribes. "Rush Gatherer" and "PowWow <br/>
Dancer" have graciously offered their assistance in planting this <br/>
series.<br/>
  The plan is for 20 boxes. We'll consider more if needed. The stamps <br/>
must be submitted by August 27th. We hope to be planting the boxes <br/>
September. October if needed. I will send a set of the stamps on <br/>
index cards to those that participate to be counted as exchanges, or <br/>
you can let me know if you wish to hunt for them at a later date. I <br/>
will provide a box that should hold up to the Ct. Winter, basic index <br/>
card logbook and black ink. If the stamp requires a certain color <br/>
ink, the carver should include that when mailing the stamp. All <br/>
participants will be noted in the clues. At this time stamps have <br/>
been carved for the Mohawk, and Nipmuc indian tribes. I would like to <br/>
avoid repeats of tribes if possible. Please e-mail me off list with <br/>
questions or participation. I will let you know if the tribe has been <br/>
spoken for. <br/>
  I think this covers the basics. Again, questions should be directed <br/>
to me off list. I hope there is some interest. Safe trails to all.<br/>

Addendum: Nanticoke, Delaware Nation (Lenni Lenape), Pequot, and <br/>
Choctaw have also been added.</div>
