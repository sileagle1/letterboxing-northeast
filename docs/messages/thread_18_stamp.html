great grandfather) was a ships captain and a  shipbuilder from Nova <br/>
Scotia. My Dad loves anything from the sea, me too. I recently re <br/>
carved my Ship to Neverland and will have it back out soon docked in <br/>
its usual spot in Windham. Well some time after the snow stops. I've <br/>
had a lot of repairs lately and  am catching up even if it doesn't <br/>
seem it at times.  Take care and dress for this weather.  Carol -<br/>
