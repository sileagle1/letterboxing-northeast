There's literally hundreds of letterbox-planters out there, and no real index of who's planted in which state other than the main LBNA website.  I don't know that I'll be able to keep up with as many individual sites if this becomes a general trend.  Who is in which state?  Who has planted where?<br/>
    To explain:  Diane and I sort by area, not planter.  When we go to a region, we look up which boxes are in that region.  They may well have been placed in South Carolina by someone from, say, Ohio.  We wouldn't know to go to an Ohioan's (Ohite?) website to check for clues.<br/>
    I believe that, for instance, the Kurdziel's way of linking their website back to the LBNA home will give maximum creative clue display while still allowing an index by state, county, etc.  I know that I probably won't keep more than one or two web addresses for indexing before a big trip in my diminished-capacity mind.<br/>
    I'm not out to structure anyone else's good time, but that's how I find clues easiest.<br/>

</span></blockquote>how I find clues easiest.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think of the LBNA site like a shopping mall. <br/>
<br/>
From a finder's perspective, it is like one stop shopping for a bunch <br/>
of clues in a particular area. However, the product available at the <br/>
mall may tend to lack the diversity you might find, say, in a <br/>
downtown shop where the items are hand crafted. Also, since the mall <br/>
attracts the majority of the finders, finder's collections tend to <br/>
look very much the same. I would not argue that shopping at the mall <br/>
is not easier - but some things are worth a bit more effort. In fact <br/>
it seems that it is the increased effort that can make the prize more <br/>
valuable and sought after. (In Maine, instances of this phenomenon <br/>
are abundant)<br/>
<br/>
For placers, the mall lets you reach a larger group of customers, and <br/>
many will partake of your products. Placers who find the mall <br/>
distasteful, or perhaps want to offer their products from a more <br/>
traditional location may miss out on many sales. Some placers do not <br/>
want the high traffic that results from mall visibility, and consider <br/>
the loss of a few sales an equitable trade off for the homogeneous <br/>
world of the mall.<br/>
<br/>
As far as a majority of placers choosing to leave the mall and open <br/>
up shop downtown, or across the tracks, or even out in the country, I <br/>
doubt that that will happen anytime soon. But I think it would be a <br/>
mistake to move all of the shops into the mall. <br/>
<br/>
Hats off to Phyto for opting to do it a different way!<br/>
