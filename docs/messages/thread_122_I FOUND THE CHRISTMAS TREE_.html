<br/>
Woo hoo!<br/>
<br/>
I swung by and got my first letterbox of 2004 with none other than a <br/>
Drew Clan Production - Great Gathering of 2001.<br/>
<br/>
Next on my list was Pete and Wanda's Favorite Ornament Series, which <br/>
I did and even found the elusive pickle.  I found Psychokiwi's <br/>
Gingerbread Man and SpringChick's Kindergarten Keepsakes.<br/>
<br/>
Since the light was still pretty good, I decided to tackle Laurette's <br/>
additions to the series, even though I knew that the Christmas Tree <br/>
was gone.<br/>
<br/>
I entered that section of the location and was fascinated by the <br/>
scenery.  I haven't been to the Pacific Northwest in a long long time <br/>
and this area really reminded me of it.  Needless to say, out went <br/>
the idea of letterboxing and in went the idea of exploring.<br/>
<br/>
A magic letterboxing pixie must have been with me, because a HALF A <br/>
MILE AWAY FROM ITS INTENDED LOCATION, FAR OFF ANY KNOWN TRAIL, JUST <br/>
SITTING THERE IN THE SUN, was a Blue Topped Rubbermaid container.  My <br/>
heart stopped.  I opened it, and there it was.  The Christmas Tree <br/>
Letterbox.  What a beauty!<br/>
<br/>
I ran back to the proper location, checked my bearings and compass <br/>
reading three, then four times, and replanted The Christmas Tree <br/>
where it belonged.  I must have gotten it right, too, because after <br/>
replanting it and going on with the clues, I immediately found "Gold <br/>
Star" and "Candy Cane".<br/>
<br/>
The light was starting to fade and me + low light = disaster, so I <br/>
will have to go back some day to find "Stocking", "Silver Bell", <br/>
and "Angel Grace".<br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year!<br/>

Maybe we should rename you Wonder Woman?  That Christmas tree has <br/>
been missing for months.  Just last week I told Wanda that "Maybe it <br/>
was about time for me to recarve that one."<br/>
Thanks for your sleuthing.  Molly's got nothing on you.<br/>

number (which I did not have) to shout out the news!  We <br/>
are "unplugged" at our home in RI, so I had no way to contact the <br/>
outside world except for cell phone.<br/>
<br/>
I did do a cursory search for Stocking, Silver Ball, and Angel Grace <br/>
on my way out (it was starting to get dark), but the clues did <br/>
not "jump out" at me, although they should be blatantly obvious.  You <br/>
should email me a number where I can reach you the next time I hunt <br/>
for those ;-)<br/>
