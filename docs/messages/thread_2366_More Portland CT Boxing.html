<br/>
Portland is having a Brownstone Festival on September 17th. There will <br/>
be all sorts of activities going on all around town, including canoe <br/>
rides in the quarry, a square dance, historic tours of brownstone <br/>
buildings in town and so much more! If you get the Rivereast news, <br/>
keep on the lookout for informationin the Portland section!<br/>
<br/>
I have agreed to plant a letterbox or two (or more?) in the riverfront <br/>
park...for which I have planned nothing at this point! But I guess <br/>
I'll have to get on that! Anyone interested in information on boxes as <br/>
I get them prepared, let me know! Anyone got a box they want to plant <br/>
for the day?<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately the town has voted to allow a scuba diving company to <br/>
lease our quarries and some acreage of the riverfront park to make a <br/>
camping area for divers to come and train....the almighty dollar at <br/>
work, God forbid we have a natural, undisturbed, non-income producing <br/>
place to enjoy in town! So, not sure how much longer we'll have free <br/>
and open access to the area...if you haven't gotten Cozy Cavy's HH <br/>
hostel or Big Pine in Portland yet, I'd plan to soon...may have to <br/>
retire them. Speaking of Cozy Cavy...the cavy it is placed in honor of <br/>
died this summer unexpectedly...poor thing!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
