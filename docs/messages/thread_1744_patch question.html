</span></blockquote>Hi there! This talk list ran a contest a few weeks back on making a<br/>
new patch specifically for the Letterboxing NorthEast talk list -<br/>
Wolfy, a boxer from CT, has a new embroidering system, and I believe<br/>
that she will be embroidering that patch onto clothing to sell.<br/>
<br/>
The winning entry (which you see on the front page) was by Phyto of<br/>
ME, and I believe she won herself an embroidered tee (?), as well as<br/>
endless praise from the Northeasterners.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>
