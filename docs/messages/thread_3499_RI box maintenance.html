<br/>
Although this is not letterboxing related I thought some locals may be<br/>
interested, at least those with kids! (And of course there are lots of<br/>
letterboxes in the area if you wanted to make a day of it!)<br/>
<br/>
 I am putting together a field trip to the Save the Bay Exploration<br/>
Center in Newpor t.  The programs are for all ages.   It  is June 26th from<br/>
9:30 - 11:30.<br/>
<br/>
They are located at the Rotunda at Easton's Beach.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.savebay.org/education_aquarium.asp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.savebay.org/education_aquarium.asp</a><br/>
<br/>
They have some great classes we  would  take as a group.<br/>
<br/>
It will be two classes back to back for a total<br/>
of two hours. Here are the classes:<br/>
<br/>
Narragansett Bay Critter Diversity and their Habitats<br/>
Students will explore biodiversity in Narragansett Bay by meeting our<br/>
animals up close and personal in the habitat exhibits they call home. We<br/>
have over 150 species of animals found in and around Narragansett Bay.<br/>
Topics to be explored are: diversity, habitats, and adaptations.<br/>
<br/>
Sandy Beach Exploration<br/>
Explore the sandy beach shoreline and see what the tide has left behind.<br/>
Learn why so many animals and plants call these areas home and see how these<br/>
habitats serve as nursery areas, environmental buffers and feeding grounds.<br/>
<br/>
T he cost is less than $10 a person  (around $8 a person I think it will end<br/>
up as) ,<br/>
possibly much less, depending on how many people we get to sign up!<br/>
<br/>
 Based on that.....please email me directly if you are interested and let me<br/>
know how many people you'd tentively be bringing.<br/>
<br/>
My email is  <a href="mailto:RIFamily@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">RIFamily@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Thanks! And I'll pass on more info as I have it!<br/>
<br/>
