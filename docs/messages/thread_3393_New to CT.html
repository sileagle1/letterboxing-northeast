How nice to have some " new"  letterboxers in the Oxford Area.  I am <br/>
nowhere near you ,  but I do get out and about so I am sure we will meet <br/>
on trails or at  a gather.  There are  quite a few boxes in almost every <br/>
corner of our little state  and you will never be bored looking for <br/>
letterboxes , or new friends.<br/>
