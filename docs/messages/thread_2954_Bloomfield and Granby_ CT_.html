Penwood State Park, Bloomfield, CT. has new clues. She got soaked one <br/>
too many times.<br/>
The Honey Bucket series and Rising Tall in McLean's Game Preserve, <br/>
Granby, CT. have been retired. I have it on good authority that the <br/>
director doesn't want boxes there and the clean up crews are removing <br/>
any that they come across. Thanks for all who visited and look for them <br/>
in new locations in the New England area.<br/>
BTW, Bell Lady, you were the only one to find the bonus box of the <br/>
Rising Tall box, congratulatios :-)<br/>
