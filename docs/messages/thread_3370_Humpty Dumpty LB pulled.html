Just wanted to let you guys know that the Humpty Dumpty LB has been <br/>
pulled until further notice. Aparently Storyland is clearing the <br/>
upper lot to make more room and the dump truck found my box. Here is <br/>
the letter I got:<br/>
<br/>
Good Evening...The upper parking lot at Story Land is curently being <br/>
leveled to be a"lower" parking lot...the bulldozer discovered the <br/>
letterbox you planted (and introduced the folks at Story Land to <br/>
Letterboxing). So...what would you like us to do with it?<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know...Thanks,<br/>

I'm having them send me the box, and I'm hoping to re-plant it when <br/>
they are done. <br/>

amazed that the dump truck found it at all... amazing it didn't just get<br/>
tossed with all the dirt and rocks!  I will be sure to look for your<br/>
letterbox next year when we go to Storyland!<br/>
