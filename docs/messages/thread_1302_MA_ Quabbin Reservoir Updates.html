Reservoir in Ware, MA, was missing, so I checked on it today.  I am happy<br/>
to say that reports of its demise are greatly exaggerated.  The box is<br/>
where it should be, safe and dry, and has been getting visitors regularly.<br/>
<br/>
I can't say exactly why, but I highly recommend that a group of 2 or more<br/>
letterboxers visit this box ASAP.  You'll be glad you did.<br/>
<br/>
I also checked in on the Find-Me Frog and Misplaced Marbles boxes, at<br/>
another spot along the Quabbin in Belchertown, MA.  They are both fine, but<br/>
the logbook for the frog was soggy, so I replaced it with a new one (now<br/>
double bagged).<br/>
<br/>
Happy letterboxing!<br/>
