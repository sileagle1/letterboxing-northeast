boxes at Leader of the Pack's 4H Fair Letterboxes.  Glad to see that <br/>
so many attended but nobody on the last day!!  Oh well, at least we <br/>
were thankful to dodge the rain for once!! (Rain and gatherings seem <br/>
to go hand-in-hand with us for some uncanny reason...) we had a good <br/>
time and got to meet Leader of the Pack, which was a treat.  Great <br/>
stamps!!</div>
