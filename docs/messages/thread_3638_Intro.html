<br/>
I live in Oakville (Watertown)CT. I discovered Letterboxing in late <br/>
August and have done 8 of the DEP seedling series. I tried for 9 but <br/>
never found the one in Naugatuck. The clues don't seem quite right, if <br/>
anyone has found it I would love to know that it can be found. LOL<br/>
<br/>
It has been so much fun and I look forward to finding all 32 as well <br/>
as finding some of the 'plantings' from other letterboxers! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am so glad to have found this 'sport'! <br/>
<br/>
Have a beautiful day!<br/>

I found the Naugatuck State Forest box on 9/4/07 so it is <br/>
definitely "findable".<br/>

It seems hard but is really easy (once you know where it is :-).<br/>
