geocaching.com site, he's noted that the letterbox is there, in case <br/>
anyone wants to know what one is, or wants to try to find the geocache <br/>
by following my clues instead of by gps. I think somehow his box was <br/>
there first, actually, because when I went to scout a place for the <br/>
box, it wasn't there, but when I wrote the clue and posted it, then <br/>
went to plant the box, the cache was there. As for being confused for <br/>
a cache, the whole box is missing, not just the stamp. I don't know - <br/>
we looked in the water down the hill from the tree, all around the <br/>
tree where it was supposed to be, but it is a big area. I had included <br/>
a couple of sheets of pages with an explanation of what letterboxing <br/>
is, that it is not trash, etc. I am just sad that it is gone. I think <br/>
I want to hand carve a stamp and redo the box - but I might try to <br/>
hide it better, somehow.</div>
