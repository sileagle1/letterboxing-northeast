<br/>
We went after the Killer Tomato LB yesterday after the gathering and we were about to go back and report it missing, when we decided to check the tree that is a few feet down from the corner of the wall.. and there it was! We thought it was strange that the clue said "upper corner" when it was actually not, but since that's where we found it, that's where we left it.  We did see the wood platform and rubber so we were confused, but, again, just left it where we found it.<br/>
<br/>
I hope it's still there<br/>

This box is not missing, just misplaced. I too found an empty <br/>
plywood and<br/>
rubber mat in the far cornerand thought it missing. But I searched <br/>
the closer<br/>
corner and there it was under some logs. I replaced the box where I <br/>
found it.<br/>
That was Saturday about 6:30 PM.<br/>

    Dan, Max, and I stamped into the killer tomato box just a couple of hours ago.  Maybe around 2 or 3 pm.  It was alive and well and tucked right in where we expected it to be.  <br/>
