We would like to request that placers update the clues on LBNA when<br/>
boxes are retired or are known to be missing.  We spent a lot of time<br/>
hunting for the White Rabbit in Red Hook only to find later (on AQ)<br/>
that it had been retired.  Also had a great hike a couple of days ago<br/>
looking for Daydream Believer series in CT only to discover later<br/>
that all were reported missing on AQ.  We usually print our clues<br/>
from LBNA since we like the way they come out.  Don't always have<br/>
time to check AQ as well.  Just some thoughts from a couple of<br/>
letterboxing addicts.<br/>

atlas quest only takes a minute more to do the same on lbna. <br/>
