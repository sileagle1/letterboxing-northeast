magazine and the December issue contains an article about letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
Coincidentally, the letterbox featured in the article is our own Max's Minute, <br/>
visited by Karen &amp; Kate Turner (we don't know Kate &amp; Karen, but thanks for <br/>
visiting!)<br/>
<br/>
So our little letterbox (the first we ever placed) has made it into print - we're <br/>
happily surprised.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Max's Minute is not hand carved, but it's in a cool spot...very public. <br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Found the above message when searching the archives. Max's Minute stamp <br/>
*is* hand carved. Maybe my RISD grad wife made it too clean, but it really <br/>
was carved by hand right here on our kitchen table.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
