chat up this hobby &amp; share some adventures...<br/>
<br/>
I would like to clarify that the is a group of friends old &amp; new who <br/>
simply love the hobby...Several of us wanted another forum to share <br/>
picture clues, special boxes and maybe maybe contribute back to this <br/>
wonderful hobby in a small way...I thought a fair criteria for <br/>
joining would be to have exchanged or shared a boxing adventure with <br/>
the moderator and or others in the group....For Example if you had <br/>
attended our Frightnight Gathering, you would have exchanged with <br/>
many if not all of us...and you would be in the group....It was fun , <br/>
and harmless little "rule" I guessed...<br/>
<br/>
I have received a couple nastygrams from a couple people inferring I <br/>
am an elitist and reek some kind of evil mojo thing...bend on world <br/>
domination of the Letterboxing universe from my little corner of Evil <br/>
(Maine)....<br/>
<br/>
To that I state LOL loudly....<br/>
<br/>
Anyways I just wanted to share this experience with the community and <br/>
those who know me should get a grand ole chuckle out of what I <br/>

I believe always in the integrity of this hobby and how so many of us <br/>

While I'm not one who would join, being I'm not in Maine or NH,  <br/>
wouldn't it have been less- I'm searching for the word but only come <br/>
up with this one- "rude" to announce a new list to an open group and <br/>
then announce that it's only for your friends?<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't it have been easier, nicer, more to what you want in your <br/>
group, to send personal invites only to those people you want on your <br/>
list?<br/>
<br/>
I'm with David here, you didn't list any rules and while you say <br/>
people are sending you nastygrams about your exclusivity, you invited <br/>
it by posting to an open list.  That's really sad and frankly,I'm <br/>
sorry, just too cliquish to say that it's not.<br/>
<br/>
BTW David, you've come a long way, baby! :o)  I'm proud of you for <br/>
sticking around, listening up and learning after a rocky start. You <br/>
have really grown in your understanding and promotion of <br/>
letterboxing.  I'd be happy to have you in a group if I had one.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   I truly appreciate that several people have joined our small <br/>
&gt; group to <br/>
&gt; &gt; chat up this hobby &amp; share some adventures...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I would like to clarify that the is a group of friends old &amp; new <br/>
&gt; who <br/>
&gt; &gt; simply love the hobby...Several of us wanted another forum to <br/>
&gt; share <br/>
&gt; &gt; picture clues, special boxes and maybe maybe contribute back to <br/>
&gt; this <br/>
&gt; &gt; wonderful hobby in a small way...I thought a fair criteria for <br/>
&gt; &gt; joining would be to have exchanged or shared a boxing adventure <br/>
&gt; with <br/>
&gt; &gt; the moderator and or others in the group....For Example if you had <br/>
&gt; &gt; attended our Frightnight Gathering, you would have exchanged with <br/>
&gt; &gt; many if not all of us...and you would be in the group....It was <br/>
&gt; fun , <br/>
&gt; &gt; and harmless little "rule" I guessed...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I have received a couple nastygrams from a couple people inferring <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; &gt; am an elitist and reek some kind of evil mojo thing...bend on <br/>
&gt; world <br/>
&gt; &gt; domination of the Letterboxing universe from my little corner of <br/>
&gt; Evil <br/>
&gt; &gt; (Maine)....<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; To that I state LOL loudly....<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyways I just wanted to share this experience with the community <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; those who know me should get a grand ole chuckle out of what I <br/>
&gt; &gt; mention above...<br/>
&gt; &gt; I believe always in the integrity of this hobby and how so many of <br/>
&gt; us <br/>
&gt; &gt; work hard to share &amp; promote this wonderful hobby.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I appreciate &amp; thank you all for allowing me a moment to share <br/>
&gt; this...<br/>
