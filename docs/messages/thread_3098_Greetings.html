I am going to be spending the next week at a conference in the Burlington area.  I have <br/>
Wednesday afternoon free and thought I might be able to meet some local boxers if anyone <br/>
is available at such short notice.  Then, on to meet southern Maine boxers next Saturday in <br/>
Portland!<br/>
<br/>
Please send me an email through AQ if you can meet or have a suggestion for a box.  (I'm <br/>
planning to get the Snowflake Bentley box at the moment.)<br/>

Thanks, and happy boxing!<br/>
