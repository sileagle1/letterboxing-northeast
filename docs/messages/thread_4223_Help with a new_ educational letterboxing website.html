<br/>
I am looking for assistance in the creation of a new, educational website about letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
This site will not really be competing with Atlas Quest or LBNA, since it will not house clues or discussion boards (and yes, Ryan and Choi know about it!). The goal of the site will be to educate new folks about letterboxing, and help more experienced boxers become...betterboxers! Through the use of tutorials, videos, animations, and articles, the site will teach you everything you could possibly want to know about letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
But it needs help from the community. That's where you come in. Iâve created a group board on Atlas Quest, which will contain postings for surveys to fill out, content requests, and beta testing. All you have to do is respond to those requests. That's it. You can participate as much or as little as you want (though the more the better).<br/>
<br/>
To help out, simply respond to this message with your AQ trailname and ask to join, and I'll send you an invite on Atlas Quest. After you join, feel free to invite anyone to the group who you think would want to help with the project. The more, the merrier! :)<br/>
<br/>
Iâll try to remember to post links to surveys and whatnot here as well as on the AQ board, but Iâm trying to keep everything all in one place, for my own sanity.<br/>
<br/>
This site is my graduate thesis project (I'm studying webdesign and new media) and the full site is scheduled to launch in summer of 2014.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for all your help!</div>
