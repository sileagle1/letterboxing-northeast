                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1958310209">We launched a new series today, it is a "Hitchhiker Series". We're not sure if this will work or if it has been tried before, but this is the idea: The series consists of three hitchhikers that combine to form one image. In order to give someone an actual chance to find the hitchhikers we ask that they stay in Rhode Island. We posted the hitchhikers as a "Mystery" series even though it really isn't. We thought this may be fun. The series is called "Keep on Truckin' Hitchhikers Series". Just thought we would share or new idea.<br/>
