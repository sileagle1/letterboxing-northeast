  We all do alot of walking in this letterboxing hobby of ours.But has this ever happened to you.You study the clues before you get to a place so you have a pretty good idea of where you need to start before you get there.I don't know how many of you been to Hurd Park in East Haddam but it has a long driveway.Theres about five boxes there and I had them all the clues stapled together except for Chuck's In Search Of Mokele-Mbembe and I didn't think much of I knew that I had all the clues in my map,so when we got there I just told My wife to grab the clues.We got all the way down to the end of the drive and I asked her to let me see the clues so we could get started,thats when I noticed that she didn't grab the clues for Chuck's box.AHH#@*&amp;^)&gt;&gt;&gt;..I said,and then I walked all the way back to the car just for those clues because I was not coming all the way back here for one box.All in all it's a nice park.The NeeDeep's  <br/>
