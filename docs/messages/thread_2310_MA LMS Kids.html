letter-box basement these past years and is listed on the geocache<br/>
listings, as well.  The geocachers have been visiting it frequently<br/>
but, of course, there have been no letterboxers. How can it be rescued<br/>
from the basement and listed on LBna?  I have written to Team<br/>
Spoonhead, the planter about the<br/>
box's status.<br/>

In Littleton, Middlesex County, Massacusetts<br/>
<br/>
Planted 10/13/02 (but not available until now) by TEAM SPOONHEAD.<br/>
Used as a school science project for the past month.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to Oak Hill from intersection of route 110 and 2A/119 in<br/>
Littleton:<br/>
<br/>
Head west on route 2A for two miles to the left intersection with<br/>
King Street (Sunoco gas station/Clyde's car wash on corner). Take<br/>
this left and proceed straight over railroad tracks to intersection.<br/>
Cross intersection and continue straight on Sanderson Road (Johnson's<br/>
convenience store on left) for another tenth of a mile to fork. Go<br/>
right at fork onto Oak Hill Road. Continue for another 200 yards to<br/>
trail-head on right. Look carefully - sign is set back from road.<br/>
<br/>
Park in the small parking area and get onto the trail system. Follow<br/>
trail to Summit Rock. Stand on the highest part of Summit rock, and<br/>
set a course on the path which is due north. When you get to the top<br/>
of the next little hill, you will see several rocks on the right and<br/>
a "triple tree" on the left. Orient yourself so you are standing on<br/>
the highest rock facing back the way you came. Position yourself so<br/>
that the blue trail marker on the tree about 20 feet in front of you<br/>
is at 182 degrees and the "triple tree" is at 251 degrees. Walk 55-60<br/>
steps at a bearing of 89 degrees. Look for a "wall" of tumbled down<br/>
rocks on your left. Just ahead of you is a V shaped tree. Stand<br/>
downhill so that you are looking directly through the V. Slightly to<br/>
the right you will see two large rocks that have rock tripe on them.<br/>
The prize (a tupperware container with a white top) is there!<br/>
<br/>
The letterbox contains a variety of small trinkets because this<br/>
location doubles as a geocache. If you take one of the small items<br/>
you should leave one. This is my wife's first letterbox and she tried<br/>
to make it challenging but not impossible! Let me know<br/>
(pmcq@...) how she did!</div>

could just enter it into letterboxing.org with a little note at the <br/>
beginning explaining that you're adopting it until the owners return. <br/>
Glad to hear the box is still alive and well, Jay in CT<br/>
