<br/>
Some exciting news! I don't know if anyone has mentioned this, but there are<br/>
some really terrific hand-made stamps that have just been put out by the MA<br/>
DCR - they have management of many parks in MA. The series was produced by 2<br/>
rangers that were inspired by the CT park service and their passport<br/>
program.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The stamps are part of a 'passport' promotion encouraging families to visit<br/>
the vast system of parks. They are hand-made by a children's illustrator and<br/>
they are all self inked. The passport books are available free from the DCR<br/>
at parks and on the website. I have visited over 31 sites with my<br/>
letterboxing buddy Ginny. It is actually better to use your own paper or<br/>
letterbox journal as the stamps are large and they bleed through the<br/>
passport book paper (and are hard to line up). There are 5 regions with 76<br/>
stamps in total. If you complete sections, you can get a t-shirt with the<br/>
stamps on it. We were the first to complete the central region!<br/>
<br/>

There are pictures of the stamps online. We have bumped into Geo cachers - I<br/>
wanted to let the letterboxing folks know about this - the stamps are more<br/>
like our hobby. Also, they are drive-bys- you find the box at the park and<br/>
open it with a combination listed in the passport book.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's a lot of fun and sometimes quite challenging. Some of the parks have<br/>
admission fees, but I have taken out park passes at my library or asked the<br/>

them! The parks are often very near each other - it is helpful to use Yahoo<br/>
maps or mapquest - they get you there one after the other. There is a fold<br/>
out map that you can get for free at any of the parks, and you can look to<br/>
see which ones are close to each other. Today, we didn't use that - and just<br/>
followed the directions on the website. Each of the parks has specific<br/>
directions - we think it is helpful for finding the box - sometimes it is<br/>
tricky and not where you would expect it. I look up things as well.<br/>

of driving around.<br/>

  Subject: [LbNE] Very cool DCR stamps in MA<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
  Some exciting news! I don't know if anyone has mentioned this, but there are<br/>
  some really terrific hand-made stamps that have just been put out by the MA<br/>
  DCR - they have management of many parks in MA. The series was produced by 2<br/>
  rangers that were inspired by the CT park service and their passport<br/>
  program.<br/>
<br/>
  The stamps are part of a 'passport' promotion encouraging families to visit<br/>
  the vast system of parks. They are hand-made by a children's illustrator and<br/>
  they are all self inked. The passport books are available free from the DCR<br/>
  at parks and on the website. I have visited over 31 sites with my<br/>
  letterboxing buddy Ginny. It is actually better to use your own paper or<br/>
  letterbox journal as the stamps are large and they bleed through the<br/>
  passport book paper (and are hard to line up). There are 5 regions with 76<br/>
  stamps in total. If you complete sections, you can get a t-shirt with the<br/>
  stamps on it. We were the first to complete the central region!<br/>
<br/>
  Here is the website for all of you that are interested:<br/>

<br/>
  There are pictures of the stamps online. We have bumped into Geo cachers - I<br/>
  wanted to let the letterboxing folks know about this - the stamps are more<br/>
  like our hobby. Also, they are drive-bys- you find the box at the park and<br/>
  open it with a combination listed in the passport book.<br/>
<br/>
  It's a lot of fun and sometimes quite challenging. Some of the parks have<br/>
  admission fees, but I have taken out park passes at my library or asked the<br/>
  folks at the entrance to stamp in. Most of the parks are really cool places<br/>
  to know about.<br/>
<br/>
  I hope we bump into some letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
  Best regards,<br/>
<br/>
