<br/>
In two weeks we are taking the kids down to the canal area of Cape Cod.  We plan on hitting some of the boxes in that area (i.e.- herring run and canal boxes).  Just wondered if anyone knew of any that we should definitely not pass by or any that are MIA.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, my husband and are going down to Wellfleet at the end of the month, alone.  We found quite a few listed in that area too.  Just wondered if anyone knew the same kind of info. for those.  Any information would be greatly appreciated.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
