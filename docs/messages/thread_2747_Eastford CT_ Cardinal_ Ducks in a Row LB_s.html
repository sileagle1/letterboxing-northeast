  My boxes are still listed and still out there.  I was just on the site and checking things over the weekend.  We haven't done much boxing, just too busy lately.  Two grandsons, another grandbaby on the way and my son getting married May 6th.  Some day we'll get ou there again!<br/>
<br/>
  Don't know what's up with the Maplines, can't help you there.<br/>

  Another thought - The Maplines were attached at the hip to Momma Fox <br/>
and Bald Eagle. Their website URL works, but it is waaaaay out of <br/>
date. I just did a search on LBNA for any boxes placed by Momma Fox <br/>
and/or Bald Eagle and I didn't even find them as placers.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone been in touch with Momma Fox and Bald Eagle?<br/>
<br/>
Double hmmmm.<br/>

contact you BY MANY PEOPLE went unanswered.  Secondly, you took your <br/>
clues offline, which means NO ONE can find your boxes!  Your Yahoo <br/>
group with your clues has been closed and no longer works, and no <br/>
one could get clues.  The link was null and void.  If the clues had <br/>
still been online on LBNA, none of this probably would have happened.<br/>
<br/>
Choi was only doing what he thought was right due to many posts on <br/>
the lists concerning your boxes, and the lack of clues.  He didn't <br/>
want people getting discouraged if they couldn't get a hold of you, <br/>
or couldn't get clues.  I personally agree with what Choi did.  I <br/>
took over some of your boxes so they wouldn't fall off completely, <br/>
which probably would have been done, seeing that there were no clues <br/>
to these boxes.<br/>
