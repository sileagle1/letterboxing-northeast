<br/>
In my 3 years of experience, I have found (by finding a variety of<br/>
different types of HHs) that the smaller the HH, the better. Use a<br/>
logbook that is smaller than the traditional size 3X5 spiral bound<br/>
index card deck, and try to find or make a stamp that is no larger<br/>
than the logbook.<br/>
<br/>
Why? The smaller the HH, the more it will travel. I can't tell you<br/>
how many times I have found HHs with the 3X5 log, and can't replant<br/>
it in the next few boxes I find because there simply is no room in<br/>
the letterbox container to hold both the original letterbox contents<br/>
*and* the HH. The smaller, the flatter, the better. Here in New<br/>
England, letterboxes tend to be small, and fit into tight hiding<br/>
places.<br/>
<br/>
But here's the fun part. *There are no rules* You can make your HH<br/>
any way you please, and let the finder take up the challenge of<br/>
replanting! We love challenges!<br/>
<br/>
Regarding labeling - when you write the name of the HH on the log<br/>
book, simply write "(insert name here) HH". You may also want to<br/>
label the outermost plastic ziplock the same way. Trust me. We<br/>
letterboxers know *exactly* what to do with them when we find them!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess it would be pretty obvious if you placed it in someone<br/>
</span></blockquote>else's box, but what if one wanted to start one in their own box? Is<br/>
that legit?<br/>
<br/>
Assume the zen lotus position and chant along with me - "there are no<br/>
rules...there are no rules...there are no rules..." ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I'm not entirely sure what you mean by this, but I have two<br/>
interpretations:<br/>
<br/>
1. You want to start a HH with its *own* plastic (or whatever) box?<br/>
Size is the issue here again. I've seen lots of HHs in their own<br/>
box, sometimes a microbox inside a film canister, sometimes in a<br/>
sandwich sized rubbermaid container. It is doable (heck,<br/>
letterboxers are pretty creative folks), but the challenge is where<br/>
to replant it. Depending on where you hunt for LBs, there may be<br/>
plenty of room in the hiding spot for the original LB and the extra<br/>
container HH. Or not. But like I said, we like challenges!<br/>
<br/>
2. You want to launch a HH in one of your own established permanent<br/>
letterboxes. Heck, I do that all the time! In fact, I made a<br/>
deliberate choice of location for one particular permanent LB of mine<br/>
that is a hitchhiker magnet because the hiding place could hold three<br/>
normal sized letterboxes! A few more of my permanent boxes have the<br/>
larger type of container (rectangular) so they can accommodate even<br/>
the larger 3X5 logbook type HH. (Okay, okay, I confess - I made<br/>
these special larger hiding places/larger containers on purpose<br/>
because I found myself carrying around larger sized HHs for weeks on<br/>
end (tsk! tsk!) because in my travels I could not find a place to<br/>
replant them. So now I have a failsafe - if all else fails, I<br/>
replant the larger HHs in these larger LBs of my own. Okay, my<br/>
secret is out!)<br/>
<br/>
I hope this post has made you laugh, given you some tips, reinforced<br/>
the "there are no rules" philosophy, and given you the boost to "go<br/>
for it".<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing,<br/>
