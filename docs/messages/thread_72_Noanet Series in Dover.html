received no reply, so I thought I'd risk it and post here.<br/>
<br/>
I did the Noanet series this weekend (all three boxes).  I found all <br/>
three with no difficulty but the logbooks are full.  Since the trail <br/>
conditions were sheer ice, I did not bring my usual supplies with me.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone here knows Russell in Real Life (tm), would you kindly let <br/>
him know?<br/>
<br/>
Also, if anyone here is planning on doing this series (magnificent, <br/>
BTW), could you bring three of the small "memo" type logbooks to add <br/>
to the boxes?  The traditional 3X5 spiral index card logs will be too <br/>
big.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch!<br/>
