<br/>
  I grew up in Plainville, neighbor to Wrentham.  We now live in Barrington RI. <br/>
  We are often in that area and will be headed there soon to check some land on Route 1A.  We have  yet to do the Wrentham boxes.  We'll let you know next time we are up if you would like to join us for a series or to exchange stamps.  Welcome to LBNE!<br/>

I'm also in North Eastern Mass, in Bradford/Haverhill. I would love<br/>
to do get-togethers for nearby lb'ers.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was logged on to newboxers and they were discussing whether they <br/>
&gt; &gt; should have a group patch for their backpacks. Does this group <br/>
&gt; &gt; have <br/>
&gt; &gt; one? Also are there any groups that get together in Ma? Lee<br/>
