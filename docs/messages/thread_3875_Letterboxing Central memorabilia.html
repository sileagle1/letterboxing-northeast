or more.<br/>
<br/>
My friends and I are putting together some fantastic educational <br/>
displays for the "We Live and Breathe Letterboxing" event. Many of <br/>
them will relate to the history of letterboxing in America.<br/>
<br/>
One such display will be a collection of letterboxing patches. It was <br/>
my intention to keep this somewhat of a secret so it would be a <br/>
surprise to those of you attending the event. But we REALLY need your <br/>
help, so I'm going to have to let the cat out of the bag...<br/>
<br/>
Although a number of people, including myself, have personally <br/>
donated quite a few patches to this collection that are no longer <br/>
available, there are still a couple of patches from around 2001 that <br/>
we need in order to properly represent the history of our hobby. They <br/>
came from your part of the country, so I figured I would just come <br/>
right out and ask if anyone has them and would be willing to donate <br/>
them to the cause. This collection will debut at the Live &amp; Breathe <br/>
event, but it is our intention to make it available for other <br/>
gatherings in the future.<br/>
<br/>
The patches in question were from a website called "Letterboxing <br/>
Central". We are looking for any patches associated with this site, <br/>
but the two we know existed were called "Witches Hollow" and "Pooch <br/>
Patch". We've contacted the former owners of the site, and various <br/>
other individuals, but have been unable to locate examples of these <br/>
patches so far.<br/>
<br/>
If you have these patches, or know someone who might, please contact <br/>
me by emailing DERMADSTAMPER at AOL dot COM. This display will help <br/>
preserve the legacy of our past, and will include an acknowledgement <br/>
of the people who donated items to help make it possible.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
