                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-431669960">Thanks for the awewsome link to DEP site! Very interesting <br/>
statistics of sightings.  I carry pepper spray also, being a solo <br/>
hiker, plus attach a whistle to my belt loop.  I also hike very <br/>
quietly, so in future plan to tie some bells to my packpack.  As <br/>
noted others, bears don't want to meet up with us any more than we <br/>
want to come face to face with them while searching for letterboxes. <br/>
When camping in remote places it has been suggested that besides <br/>
keeping food well wrapped and protected, such as hoisting one's pack <br/>
in a tree, (raccoons will have a field day with that!) you should <br/>
make noise as you hike. Bells offer a pleasant jingle and are sure <br/>
easier to manage than singing "100 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" over <br/>
and over again. Darn it though-I love birdwatching/listening too! <br/>
Bears..birds...bears.. birds. What's a letterboxer to do?? <br/>
