We stayed at the Fort Dummer State Park and drove down the road to Molly Stark SP to do the Mount Olga boxes.<br/>
A very fine walk (now that the cooler weather is here). The view from the top of the Fire Tower was awesome! Well worth the trepidation of the climb. We found the Polar Bear Pride LB. The logbook was soaked through and is pretty well illegible. We replaced the logbook and tried to dry out the stamp box. If you visit this box - bring ink. I will try to contact the placer in order to return the original logbook.<br/>
We also found (after much searching) Wolves at the Fire Tower LB. The inkpad for this stamp is disintegrating and starting to gunk up the stamp. So, bring along ink for this box as well.<br/>
We drove into Wilmington for supper at the Maple Brew Pub (we're never in this town at suppertime!) and started the Wilmington Summer Sports Series. Got too dark to finish and the beer and steak was calling. So we'll have to get back to the area.<br/>
On Sunday we went in search of Crickets on Old Route 30 LB, unfortunately all we did was hear crickets on old route 30! At the supposed site of the box we found a few discarded bottles, but no box.<br/>
We went on to The Culvert LB across the Dam. We found the box and inside were "The Traveling Pumpkins" HH and "Fritzy the Flea" HH Parasite. We also came across a new family of Letterboxers. We set them up with a logbook and Dave quickly carved them a stamp (He's pretty embarrased, as he carved it backwards - but they loved it!) The family is from Massachusetts and is really enamored of this new hobby. Keep your eyes out for the NU V (or a stamp that kinda looks like that - ;). We told them about the Newcomers list so hopefully they will find that chat list as well as this one. So, welcome to Kim, John, Keeghan, Nick and Emily.<br/>
