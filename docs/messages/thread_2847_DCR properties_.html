people needing to ask rangers for permission to plant boxes in other places.<br/>
Are DCR (Dep of Conserv &amp; Rec, in MA) properties typically places that are<br/>
hard to place a box?    Easier to just plant it?   Or better to ask<br/>
permission?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm specifically thinking of Elm Grove Bank in Wellesley/Sherborn.    Looks<br/>
like a really neat place, I see no boxes listed there and wonder if it's b/c<br/>
the location is "taboo" or just that no one has attempted?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1802232291">There are plenty of boxes in DCR properties, including State Parks <br/>
and State Forests.  <br/>
<br/>
To the best of my knowledge, there is no official restricition on <br/>
placing boxes on DCR property.  There are lots of open spaces, <br/>
including DCR lands, that do not yet have any letterboxes.  You <br/>
should have no issues planting at Elm Bank currently.<br/>
<br/>
However, as the popularity of this hobby and others, such as <br/>
Geocaching, grows, it is increasingly likely that organizations such <br/>
as the DCR will issue regulations.  In fact, the DCR has already <br/>
established an intent to require permits to place geocaches, <br/>
letterboxes and the like on it's watershed properties (such as the <br/>
Quabbin Reservoir lands).  Theres is a group called the "DCR <br/>
Geocaching Policy Group" that was supposedly working on this policy <br/>
with implementation scheduled for 2006.  I have no information, <br/>
however, as to whether that policy has, in fact, been developed or <br/>
implemented.  This intiative, however, sits within the DCR's <br/>
Division of Watershed Supply Protection, and does not appear to <br/>
cross over to either the Division of State Parks and Recreation or <br/>
the Division of Urban Parks and Recreation.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, it appears that any such policy will only apply to <br/>
watershed properties and that geocaches and letterboxes will be <br/>
allowed with a permit.  Elm Bank Reservation is not a watershed <br/>
property AFAIK (nor is it within the jurisdiction of the Division of <br/>
Watershed Supply Protection), so again, you should be fine placing a <br/>
box there.<br/>
