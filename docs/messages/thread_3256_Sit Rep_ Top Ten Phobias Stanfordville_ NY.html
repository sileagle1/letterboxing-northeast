<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Of the 5 unknown, I'm reasonably sure 4 are in place, but due to time constraints, I just didn't put<br/>
100% into it.  Those rock walls look a lot more alike now then they did a year ago!!  There is one<br/>
that was originally planted on an old un-maintained trail that has since been rehabbed.  It could<br/>
still be there, but it was near the end of my day and I just didn't have it in me to give the steep<br/>
uphill trek a shot.  Not to mention in my infinite wisdom, I hiked the blasted thing backwards.<br/>
better on the knees, less so for the sense of placement LOL<br/>
<br/>

SOOOOO all that being said, I'm willing to go back, I believe with more manpower we could find them<br/>
with no problem.  If anyone is willing to either walk it with me or walk it on their own, I'm<br/>
offering a custom carved stamp in their honor.  Any Takers?????  Otherwise, they'll have to wait<br/>
