<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I�ve attended many gathering over the years and have always been amazed at the varied and wonderful<br/>
dishes boxers bring to the pot luck table.  This weekend the star of the Winter Games: Box O�lympics<br/>
was Firestarter�s hot Mexican layered did, which turned out to the main course for many of us.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Amazing Butternut Soup I had at Fright Night II and the dip (both of which I cornered the maker<br/>
for recipe) gave me an idea for a traveling event box.  Do you have a favorite item that you like to<br/>
make and bring to gathers for the pot luck table?  If so e-mail me off list.  All you need to do is<br/>
send me the recipe with a little history as why you bring it or why it represents where you live and<br/>
carve a stamp to go along with the recipe.  The recipes will be compiled into a booklet which will<br/>
travel with the stamps and be available to anyone who wants one.  I�d like to have recipes from all<br/>
over the country!  What do y�all bring to gathers down it Texas?  How bouchas up in Minnesota EH?<br/>
Dude what�s cooking is Callie?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Although I didn�t make it for the Winter Games, I�m going to put in my recipe for Egg Cream, a real<br/>
New York treat! And probably my Maple Espresso Cake.  What are you going to include?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Talking Turtle<br/>
<br/>
Of the Alphabet Bandits<br/>
<br/>
Of the Hudson Valley<br/>
