A group of her biggest fans got together and planted a series of letterboxes that she could "find" while confined to crutches, and planted them under the mystery-boxer name Ducsfanclub on lbna.<br/>
<br/>
It's time for all the planters of those boxes to "adopt" their own boxes back from Ducsfanclub so that the clues and boxes can be maintained by the real owners. Messages about missing boxes are starting to build up at the inbox, sorry to say.<br/>
<br/>
Please send a note via contact the placer to Ducsfanclub on the boxes you would like to adopt.<br/>
