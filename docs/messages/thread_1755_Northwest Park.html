The series called Plant an Herb Garden at Northwest Park in Gramby will <br/>
be pulled by the end of the month.  I have been informed that the area <br/>
where the Series is located is to be enlarged and much cutting of the <br/>
brush has already begun.  The Dill Box has been cut in half by a machine <br/>
already,  by accident.  The series will be re planted later in the <br/>
spring .  Thank you to all who have hunted these boxes.  It is very <br/>
enjoyable to read the Dill Log book even though it has been chopped in <br/>
half.  The Voyagers handed the log book to me as we met on the trail <br/>
yesterday.  Thanks Bob and Caroline<br/>
Notice will be posted on the clue page soon.<br/>
happy boxing,  and there are many more letterboxes in this park.  Go get <br/>
them !!<br/>
