North Providence and Providence - we started at the RIC Letterbox,<br/>
moved to the Square In The Middle box, and then we headed over to the<br/>
temporary Holiday 2004 box in Providenece.  I loved all the stamps!<br/>
<br/>
Today Pigtographer and I went down to North Kingston - we started<br/>
looking for the "Faces of Wickford" - the four box series had no<br/>
indication of being pulled (other than box 4, which was drying out) -<br/>
so after trying to find the first two boxes, we assumed that the<br/>
series had been pulled.<br/>
<br/>
We went off to find Afternoon on the Amazon, which was in good shape<br/>
for being there for 4 years!  Beautiful views of the frozen lake from<br/>
the path.</div>
