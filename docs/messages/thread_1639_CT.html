Not to embarass you or anything, but if I had to place a box in a more perfect spot <br/>
in Hartford, right downtown at the Soldier and Sailor's Monument in that location <br/>
with that proximity to the place, well I couldn't have wished for a more wonderful <br/>
boxing moment.<br/>
<br/>
In short, thank you for your new boxes, they have real class and creativity. I really <br/>
enjoyed my weekend in Connecticut.<br/>

Thank you for your kind words! Considering the location of the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Arch Letterbox, I'm not sure how long it will last.  I work in the city and spent many a lunch hour scouring sites in and around the Arch. Then one day I finally said, what the heck... if it lasts a week or a month and a few boxers venture into the city to hunt the box and see the Arch and a few of the other nearby treasure, then it'll be worth whatever time it remains there.  Glad you liked it!  Blessings, MayEve<br/>

Let me share something that I found this weekend while scouting out a letterbox <br/>
location in a favorite spot of mine. I discovered a serene inscription upon the four <br/>
sides of a stone monument that read: <br/>
<br/>
"VITA BREVE, ARS LONGO"<br/>
<br/>
For those latin scholars out there, forgive my hideous translation and/or spelling - <br/>
however I read this as LIFE IS SHORT ART IS FOREVER. So in those brilliant words, I <br/>
think your art will last on long beyond the physical box/location.  I appreciate the <br/>
efforts of artists and creative thinkers everwhere you are brave enough to put their <br/>
ideas out for the public! Here's to you folks! <br/>
<br/>
Cheers!~ <br/>
