Boston to Saugus in pursuit of the Breakheart Reservation and<br/>
Wiffleball 1 boxes.<br/>
<br/>
The Breakheart box was a perfect example of why letterboxing is so<br/>
wonderful. I have driven in that area several times to visit someone<br/>
who lives near Petrie's (flower shop across the street from<br/>
reservation entrance) and never even noticed the entrance sign<br/>
(traffic can be a little hairy on that section of the parkway). So all<br/>
this time I had no idea that, in the middle of what I thought was pure<br/>
Route 1 urban blight and gaudy roadside hell, there was this<br/>
breathtakingly beautiful reservation. Wow!<br/>
<br/>
The clues to the box took us along a paved path that is open part of<br/>
the year to traffic. Happily, not this part of the year, and just some<br/>
of the pavement was visible for the first mile (second mile was<br/>
completely snow and ice-covered). It was a glorious walk among rolling<br/>
hills, a little stream weaving along the way, carving snow sculptures<br/>
in its path.<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, however, the box itself was completely waterlogged (placer was<br/>
contacted). There were a bunch of footsteps near the tree, but I think<br/>
these were related to the sledding trails down the little hillside on<br/>
which it resides. We covered the box back up and made more misleading<br/>
footprints in the snow near other trees.<br/>
<br/>
We then proceeded to finish the loop, which ended at the little lodge.<br/>
There we encountered another form of bliss â€“ a roaring fire, two empty<br/>
rocking chairs, and chocolate chip cookies laid out. Ahhhh. Thank you<br/>
to Bill &amp; Craig for introducing us to this wonderful place.<br/>
<br/>
After that, we went in pursuit of Wiffleball 1 a few miles down the<br/>
parkway. This one had the most adorable clues -- though, I must admit,<br/>
as a Bear of Very Little Brain, I *never* would have gotten the clue<br/>
about "Wiffleball's Green Monster," but happily my bf is blessed with<br/>
more discerning brain cells. This box was wet, but the log was dry in<br/>
its bag. Cute log book.<br/>
<br/>
And finally it was down the parkway again to Medford to a small<br/>
unprepossessing restaurant in Medford Square where the Boston Globe<br/>
has twice proclaimed as the source of the best Sichuan food outside of<br/>
China: the Chilli Garden. *yum*<br/>
