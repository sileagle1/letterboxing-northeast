<br/>
First I would like to apologize for the mistake I made<br/>
on my new The Maplines Air Line Railroad Series on Box<br/>
#7. I am usually very careful about these sort of<br/>
things. But I am human and I can make one mistake a<br/>
year. Thatï¿½s it for this  year. Here is the way it is<br/>
supposed to read.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OK you can use a new page for the next 2 stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Ok walk back towards your car. Go over the old bridge<br/>
again. Take 72 steps RIGHT FOOT ONLY. Stop and you<br/>
look for a path on the right. BEFORE THE POWER LINES.<br/>
Now with the path behind you and the rail bed on your<br/>
right and left. Now look for a large Maple tree in the<br/>
woods. It will have 3 rocks in front of it. Look<br/>
inside the 3 rocks and under a small rock you will<br/>
find Box # 7.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about that I hope you had fun anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Paul<br/>
