<br/>
  I checked on all the boxes that I know of up there and am very happy to report that they are all in place. <br/>
<br/>
  I replaced a broken box, a soggy log book and assorted baggies etc, but for the most part everything was in great shape. All are hidden better than when found. <br/>
<br/>
  If any of the other planters (Jay Drew, Butterfly, NeeDeeps) want details, just let me know.<br/>
<br/>
  It was just great to be outside today.<br/>
