found "Birds of a Feather" series by the Pepes (in Wilmington, VT.)  <br/>
We are so ready to get back there this winter to x.c. ski on the <br/>
Catamount trail! Found "The Moose is Loose" h.h. in box # 1.  A <br/>
previous finder just stamped into the logbook without packing up the <br/>
moose. This h.h. was found not once, not twice, but 3 times by Wanda <br/>
and Pete-across state borders! He is presently hanging out in my <br/>
letterboxing satchel but shall soon be set free. I also <br/>
found "Alternate Energy" l.b. (also in Wilmington, also placed by the <br/>
Pepes)--great carving and a  gorgeous spot.  We had a picnic supper <br/>
looking out at the reservour and will plan on swimming there next <br/>
time we visit in summer.<br/>

catch all the boxes along I-91, we were able to view the Quechee Gorge from the <br/>
perspective of the photo here on our LBNE page! That was great. We ran into some <br/>
fellow questers - a young boy and his grandmother and had to stop and meet. Kind <br/>
of like letterboxing - only they were using the Valley Quest book. We exchanged <br/>
some hints and went on our way!<br/>
<br/>
Isosceles released P L A N C K  - 4th in the Physics in a Can series. This was left at <br/>
Hip-Hop, a Funhog box! Lots of fun hogging up that box with our good times....<br/>
<br/>
We boxed, we placed, we wined and dined! What a fun impromptu honeymoon <br/>
vacation for the phyto plankter and the triangle with two equal sides.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks folks!<br/>
