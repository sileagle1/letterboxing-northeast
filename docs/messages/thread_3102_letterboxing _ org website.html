Did I miss something?  This is the only letterboxing group I am on so perhaps it has been discussed on some of the other groups.  But what has happened to letterboxing . org ? and is it coming back soon?<br/>

Apparently, the traffic was too much for the current host and they  <br/>
are researching options and hoping to be up and running elsewhere soon.<br/>
<br/>
If I was closer, I'd join you at RHPS. :-)<br/>

Although it may seem like it runs on magic, the recent growing pains show that it's  <br/>
dedicated folks like Choi that provide this great service. Good luck with finding a new <br/>
home for us! <br/>
