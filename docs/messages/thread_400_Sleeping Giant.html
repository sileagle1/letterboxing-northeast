great fun and you made me work for your event stamp -- well worth all<br/>
the pushy questions I kept up.. I Love those boots.  It is a GREAT<br/>
stamp. Northstar also came up with a nice event stamp.  The whole day<br/>
was wonderful -See- Sunshine, I can use it too.  Wonderful wonderful<br/>
!! Rubacuc , we missed the Maine Gather, but the day could not have<br/>
been much better.  Thanks to all <br/>

finally see that Eagleboxer2002 does exist!!!!!  That made my day ;-)  <br/>
Northstar and I went out to the Southeast (?) side of the giant and found <br/>
Right Knee, Bluebird's Feather, Box #2 of Birds, and Left Hand, but were <br/>
unable to still find Left Knee.  Figures, that it's the last box on the <br/>
GIant that I will need!  All in all though, a great day!  And a double <br/>
surprise.... a box placed in my honor (Music Woman's Passion) near the Giant <br/>
in Wallingford completed the day!  Surprisingly enough, someone got to the <br/>
box before me and got the first finder's certificate, but oh well!  It was a <br/>
nice surprise just the same!  Thanks Northstar for the great box and the <br/>
great present that went along with it (can't give out the present, it would <br/>
spoil the box!)!!!  I can't wait to indulge!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing everyone!<br/>
