<br/>
What fun looking for a newly planted LB in the snow - sparks the imagination!  Total snow covered trail only 6 days earlier and now trodden by groups of footprints to destination and back again.  Tracks off the beaten path - looking for the best hiding place!  "No, not there - not what I'm looking for...we need to find a place where we can attach the cord and drop it down out of sight..."  "Look at the Wolf tree!"  "Cool!"  WR  WR  Follow the initials..."Wow!, I'm sure there's a great place in these rocks somewhere!"  footprints here and there - searching, searching...AHHHHHHH!  There it is - "Be careful!"  The plant is complete, sticks in place, can't see a thing.  Another successful plant.......and find!  Thanks to Wild Rover, May Eve, Bird Stamper, Krusty Crab - sorry if I left anyone out!  The best mental health day I've had in ages!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>
