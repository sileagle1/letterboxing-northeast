&gt;&gt;   i would be hesitant about saying a box is missing. <br/>
&gt;&gt;always go on <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt;&gt; assumption that you can not find it until the placer or <br/>
&gt;&gt;someone <br/>
&gt; who knows<br/>
&gt;&gt; where it is has checked. i know i have a number of boxes <br/>
&gt;&gt;that are <br/>
&gt; repeatedly<br/>
&gt;&gt; reported as missing.when i go to check they are right <br/>
&gt;&gt;where they <br/>
