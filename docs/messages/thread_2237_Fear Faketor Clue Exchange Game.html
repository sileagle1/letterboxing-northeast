<br/>
In addition to the many activities planned for the Fear Faketor Day<br/>
gather on July 29th  in Stanfordville, NY we are planning on hosting a<br/>
round of the Clue Exchange Game courtesy of Scarab of the Doubtful<br/>
Guests.<br/>
<br/>
If you plan to participate, I need to know in advance what Suspect,<br/>
Weapon and/or Location you are planning on bringing.  If you would like<br/>
to play but unable to carve your own stamp, there will be some standard<br/>
pieces available.<br/>
<br/>
The link below holds information about the version as played at the<br/>
Mid-Atlantic Gathering in May.  It's give the basic idea as to how the<br/>
game is played.  Some aspects are subject to minor change.<br/>
<br/>
Hoping to hear from you all soon,<br/>
<br/>
TT<br/>
