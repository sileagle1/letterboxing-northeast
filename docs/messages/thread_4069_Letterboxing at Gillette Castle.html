                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-771424422">FYI: The present Supervisor at Gillette Castle State Park is having some issues with our hobby.  He wants to talk to me about letterboxing and I hope to put any of his anxiety/fear/misunderstanding to rest.  In the meantime, it is my understanding that some of the boxes have been pulled by his staff, under his direction.  I do not know which ones.  I will report back as soon as I know anything further.<br/>
thanks,.<br/>
