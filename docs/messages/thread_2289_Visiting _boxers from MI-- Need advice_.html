<br/>
My husband and I are planning a visit to your part of the world from <br/>
Michigan in September. Of course, we will be doing some (read: a lot) <br/>
of letterboxing while we visit! We were wondering if you all have <br/>
advice on which boxes are "musts", those which may be out of <br/>
commission, etc. We will be staying mostly in CT and MA. Any advice and <br/>
thoughts would be appreciated... since you all seem to have quite a few <br/>
more boxes than MI does!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
