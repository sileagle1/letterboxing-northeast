<br/>
Just wanted to share that this wonderful spot in Casco Bay near <br/>
Portland apparently has substained alot of storm damage . I was going <br/>
there recently to letterbox with friends, and we discovered the <br/>
causeway/bridge to the island blocked off and trails closed....<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to share....This is a great spot for a day walk/hike and <br/>
photography of the bay area.....<br/>
