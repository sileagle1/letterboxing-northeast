(What a wonderful park btw)  At the last box, we looked up the trail and saw more letterboxers!  We had to hurry to hide the box and then went and met a family of wonderful newbie boxers.  This was their first ever.... no sig stamp, no journal, nothing.  It was great meeting and discussing the fine art of boxing.  Later by the barn, someone spotted the letterboxing patch on my bag and asked if there were boxes here!  More great newbies!  We were more than happy to hand over our directions and send them on their way.  This sport is growing people, and wahoo to that.  Hope everyone had a terrific weekend out there boxing!<br/>
