<br/>
Spent this afternoon in Columbia, CT hiking at Columbia Recreational Park and Utley Hill Preserve Joshua's Trust.  What a great day - to think that it was about 40 degrees colder last week!  Got 2 stamps, saw 2 Grey herons (where's the camera when you need it), no snakes (that's a plus) and found an awesome feather (probably red tail hawk).  Thumbs up (literally and figuratively) to the Utley Hill Preserve!  You'll know what I mean when you get the stamp placed by Chuck and Molly.  <br/>
<br/>
Interesting though - the stamp was placed 2/16/02.  There were so many stamp entries in 2002 and 2003 - over half the logbook.  There were 3 entries in 2004 and I was the only one in 2005.  I'm not sure what this means.  Did all the "regulars" stamp in so quickly and now the newbies are finding it?  (and not too many newbies these days?)  Or have there been so many new boxes planted in the last year or 2 and box series that no one is going to the old plants anymore?  Not sure, but you'll find a nice hike there.  Once you find the box, continue on to the yellow trail loop if you like hiking.  Doesn't take much longer and brings you back to the connector.<br/>
<br/>
One more mention - I really appreciate the sensitivity of the planters to show us how to get back to our cars after finding the boxes.  We all know there are waivers of responsibilities in LBNA, but I've seen - at least in CT - that the planters are ever vigilant to make sure that the finders are oriented and are given instructions to return to their cars.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy, <br/>
<br/>

P.S.  Please remember to bring bug spray!  The bugs have gone crazy with the sudden hot weather.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks to Laurie, Chuck and Molly for the nice afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>
