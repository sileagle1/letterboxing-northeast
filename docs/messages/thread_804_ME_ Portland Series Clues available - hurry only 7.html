I just wanted to let you know that the clues for my Portland East-End microbox series <br/>
are floating around out there. At the Maine Gathering in March several copies were <br/>
handed out and passed on to other boxers. Well, I discovered that I have another 7 <br/>
copies. Phynstar is on my list for one - so if anyone thinks they might be interested in <br/>
the Portland series and would like a copy please email me off list.<br/>
<br/>
I will need your mailing address to faciliate clue dispersal. <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Phyto <br/>
<br/>
The first 7 people to email me will get the clues. Otherwise, I will make an <br/>
announcement as to who got them, and then when those folks are done hopefully <br/>
they will be kind enough to pass them along. I'd like to keep these clues only <br/>
available through exchange and paper copy - they are not available anywhere else. I <br/>
won't ever publish them on the webpage.</div>
