of Monday May 22!<br/>
The clues for the Cultural Center have been changed, not due to the on <br/>
going renovations, but because of a car accident that `removed' one of <br/>
the needed clue `pieces'.<br/>
Lastly, on behalf of Krab King, I am to report that Creve has been <br/>
retired.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who have found these and happy hunting to those who still <br/>
are in the pursuit of these treasures</div>
