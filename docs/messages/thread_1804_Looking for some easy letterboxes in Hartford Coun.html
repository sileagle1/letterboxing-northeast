activity that includes letterboxing. I was wondering if any one could give <br/>
me some suggestions of letterboxes that are on easy trails with nice views <br/>
in Hartford County. I'm looking for trails that are about an hour long to do <br/>
. Even though I live in Hartford County, I haven't been able to do many of <br/>
the boxes in the area. Any help would be much appreciated. You can send <br/>
responses to my e-mail address <a href="mailto:tmalbernaz@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">tmalbernaz@...</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
