 We found the Pamet Harbor LB on 10/14/04. It wasn't very easy to find, <br/>
for us, but we are, even now, just not very darn good at finding. We <br/>
are better at the hiking part. But you can email me, for more details.<br/>

  Thanks for your response  - it has been the only one. Anyway, congrates on finding the Pamet Harbor LB! We turned over every rock and pulled out all the sea grass and there was nothing. Since it has been two years since you have found it, I am feeling that it just might not be there anymore. I am hoping the LB planters will respond and let us know if it is still there and worth another look. My son, who is 4 years old, was very disappointed but it was forgiven after finding the LB in the Orleans Cardinals Baseball field - he is an avid baseball fan.<br/>
  Happy Letterboxing and again thanks for the hope.<br/>

in doing any hiking reminded me of the Thoreau essay that I posted a <br/>
few months ago called "Walking." Some letterboxers recently emailed <br/>
me to let me know that they really got it, which was nice to hear. If <br/>
you missed it, here's the link -- it's inspired reading:<br/>

disease, and anemia.   I am more tired hiking a mile now, than I was before I got <br/>
sick and could swim across Buzzards Bay or hike 30 miles.<br/>
<br/>
So for me, the light hikes are great.   <br/>
<br/>
Somehow there almost needs to be some kind of extreme letterboxing.   But for <br/>
now, as I get my health back.. I'll stick to .. hop out, short walk, no <br/>
stress boxes.<br/>
