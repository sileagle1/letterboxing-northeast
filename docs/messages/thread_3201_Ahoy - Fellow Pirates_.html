Thanks to Kelli and her Minions for planning and pulling off this Piratey (is there such a word?) Event.  And not to mention - the gorgeous weather!<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks to Dan of Team Safari for keeping me focused on the Davy Jones' Locker mystery.  Anyone who knows me is aware that mysteries are not my strength!  lol<br/>

  Exhausted but Fulfilled,<br/>
