Spring is HERE! And the Summer thing with Fear Faketor. Lest Fall feel<br/>
left out, The Alphabet Bandits are hosting a mini-gather and hike up<br/>
Mount Beacon on Sunday October 23rd.  If you'd like more info, check out<br/>
AtlasQuest or e-mail me directly.<br/>
<br/>
Mt. Beacon is a strenuous hike, rising 1,685ft in just over 1 mile.  The<br/>
Baby Bandits have done it as young as 3 years old with only one needing<br/>
a little assistance (namely walking while asleep for the first 1/3 of<br/>
the way back down then spending the rest of it on my back)<br/>
<br/>
This is a B.Y.O.L.T.P. (Bring Your Own Letterbox To Plant) Event.  The<br/>
Bandits will be planting 2 boxes and welcome any submissions (if you<br/>
can't make it) as long as they are related to fall or the seasons.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to hear from youse gize soon,<br/>
<br/>
