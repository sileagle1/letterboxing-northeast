<br/>
We are planning to attend the Chatfield Hollow gathering. This will <br/>
be our first gathering, anything we should know or bring or do? <br/>
<br/>
Spent Friday exploring the Witches Hollow series there, only did two <br/>
legs of it but hope to finish them this week. The Staircase LB was <br/>
not in its location, we searched relentlessly for it. <br/>
<br/>
What great trails there are at Chatfield Hollow, can't wait to go <br/>
back! <br/>
