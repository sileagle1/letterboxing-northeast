bugs out yet, lots of sunshine and all those incredible laurals.  I <br/>
plan to get back mid-June as Wanda mentioned they are in full bloom <br/>
then.<br/>
  We climbed to the overlook and had lunch ( F.Y.I., NeeDeep's "Once <br/>
Was Mine" l.b. is there-I already had found it preciously).  We then <br/>
continued on to Chuck and Molly's Boston Hollow l.b. and sat by a <br/>
crystal clear stream to stamp in and read the logbook.  There were lots <br/>
of unafmiliar stampers and not that many familiar stampers-inners. As <br/>
noted in the clue sheet this hike (1.5 miles each way) is not <br/>
recommended for kiddos. However, it does make for a really nice <br/>
afternoon especially if you stop at the overlook for a while.<br/>
  Other very nearby boxes are: Rain/Sleet/Snow, The Fall of the Pixies <br/>
and  Nipmuck Natchaug.<br/>
