<br/>
Looks like we pulled off a good surprise - on most of you. Our Prince <br/>
of Naples 2 hour, limited edition letterbox was a front for an <br/>
ungathering, starring Randy Hall/Mapsurfer.<br/>
<br/>
I arranged this with Randy shortly after he did the interview for us <br/>
on our website back in the fall. Randy wanted something quiet, not <br/>
advertising his name and in such a way that we had to get boxers to a <br/>
place, then have them find out that it was a gathering!<br/>
<br/>
So I came up with a 2 hour letterbox and you know the rest of the <br/>
story. Randy was there but the biggest stars were those 35 loyal, <br/>
wonderful letterboxing friends of ours who braved the rain and the <br/>
mud. Hopefully the gathering was their reward and Randy was a bonus.<br/>
<br/>
How do you find people willing to drive from RI, MA, NY and the far <br/>
reaches of CT except in this crazy letterboxing world of ours?  <br/>
Special thanks to Randy, Jay Drew for carving the ungathering stamp <br/>
and all of our friends who showed up and made this a most special day.<br/>
The day ended with about 10 of us sharing stories over some grinders <br/>
and beer at a local restaurant.<br/>
<br/>
Sue and I want to thank all who attended from the bottom of our <br/>
hearts. This was truly above and beyond!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

</span></blockquote>Sad to say, in all of the excitement of the park ranger showing up late to unlock the pavilion and the challenge of the rain, we never pulled out our camera! Our website has a general idea of what went on yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The new, relocated Prince of Naples letterbox clues will be announced soon so that those of you that missed the letterbox can at least get the stamp - but of course, Randy Hall will not be included!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
