<br/>
I will be in Maine soon and was wondering if anyone would like to meet <br/>
up on August 7th...I will be in the Brunswick area and will be willing <br/>
to travel south as far as Portland and north as far as Wiscassett.<br/>
<br/>
Please email me if you are interested in meeting (off list). I will be <br/>
there with another NY boxer that will remain a mystery! (her first <br/>
visit to the great state of Maine!).<br/>
