Although I was under the weather, I still managed to find 20 regular boxes in the park and six day only boxes!  I'm SOOOO glad I brought the bike!  It made getting to the other side of the park so much easier!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for a great time!  And btw.... I loved that Picnic box that you planted!<br/>
