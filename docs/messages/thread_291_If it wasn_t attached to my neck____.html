you outdid yourself this time. Thank you very much for a wonderful <br/>
afternoon! You are the best!<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry to say that with my usual chaotic spaciness, I ran off with <br/>
P&amp;W and the Pepe's and left a Very Important Package behind at the <br/>
farm.<br/>
<br/>
I had brought a box of old, retired logbooks for people to leaf <br/>
through, but neglectfully left them on those benches just at the <br/>
entrance. They were wrapped in a plastic bag and inside was a golden <br/>
shoe box full of retired logbooks.<br/>
<br/>
Did anyone happen to find them? We'll gladly pay postage for their <br/>
safe return.<br/>
<br/>
Wonderful to see everyone and to meet so many great new letterboxers,<br/>

</span></blockquote>Oh, Jay, and here I was thinking that you left them especially for me <br/>
to leaf through and enjoy, then mail back to you!<br/>
<br/>
I have them, and you're not getting them back until I'm done going <br/>
through them!  (Warrior Woman time = within a week)<br/>
<br/>
Email me with the address and I'll have them out in the post by the <br/>
end of the week.<br/>
