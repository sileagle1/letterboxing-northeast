wishes.  I have a very sympathetic doctor who had me go into the <br/>
office on Thursday and injected every one of my 27 stings with <br/>
cortisone to reduce the swelling in anticipation of my bridesmaid <br/>
duties.  I only had a few horribly visible welts for Mary's wedding.  <br/>
Fortunately, I am quite tanned from this summer and they didn't show <br/>
up all that bad.  Plus, Mary was just absolutely STUNNING and all the <br/>
focus was on her.<br/>
<br/>
The cortisone shots relieved the pain and swelling until about mid-<br/>
Sunday, then all the welts came back with a vengeance.  Back to the <br/>
Benadryl and Epsom salt baths ....<br/>
