                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1412196064">tuesday morning found the girls and i in rhode island (when an italian<br/>
father tells his only daughter to come visit you best be going to visit!).<br/>
well, being as this was the first time we had been in r.i. since we started<br/>
letterboxing of course we had to see what was in the area. cranston,<br/>
providence, east providence, north providence, pawtucket and central falls<br/>
all looked like good choices at the time. seems teamgreendragon has a box<br/>
planted at my old partying grounds and i was very eager to get that one.<br/>
after doing the family thing off we headed. cranston was a good walk,<br/>
beautiful weather; was totally amazed that the one in providence was still<br/>
there; east providence was a piece of cake. off to north providence and the<br/>
one i really really want. <br/>
<br/>
now what is up with this van? wont shift. to make a very long story very<br/>
short, drove to a garage and asked the mechanic there if i could borrow a<br/>
funnel to put some fluid in. he kindly obliged. i pour the fluid in and out<br/>
pours the fluid, on the ground, as quick as i could pour it in. up on the<br/>
lift it goes. transmission was cracked right in half, just hanging there.<br/>
how we managed to drive 10 miles or more like this i will never understand.<br/>
the van now has a new home in some junkyard in rhode island, and we spent 5<br/>
hours arranging to get back home to new hampshire. <br/>
<br/>
this got us to thinking. there is a poison ivy box, a boo-boo box, a 100<br/>
(found and planted) box, a 500 box. what about a my car broke down while<br/>
letterboxing box? i know i have seen stories about being pulled out of deep<br/>
mud. then there is poor kreepi kelli and (was it music woman? cant<br/>
remember) whose car was badly damaged in an accident. how about flat tires?<br/>
<br/>
do you realize how difficult it is to go letterboxing without a car?! this<br/>
is disastrous!<br/>
<br/>
all of this just to tell you that there is now a broken down car box.<br/>
havent thought of a name yet. so far we have the crash-boom-bang box or the<br/>
!@#$%^ box. anyone have another idea? to get this box just tell your story<br/>
of how your car was hurt while letterboxing. hopefully you will get this box<br/>
as seldom as you get poison ivy or the boo-boo box. <br/>
