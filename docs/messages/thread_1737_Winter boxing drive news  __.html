<br/>
The response to the Hartford County Winter Drive has been overwhelming, and <br/>
that's very exciting!  Here are some things to know if you are planning to <br/>
attend:<br/>
<br/>
1.  There have been some adjustments made to the route.  Please eliminate <br/>
Tobacco Heritage, Cute Cluckers and Spring Has Sprung, due to some missing <br/>
reports.  :/<br/>
However, you can add Inland Lobster in Windsor.  :)<br/>
<br/>
2.  Mark and I have discussed the driving directions, and we don't think it's <br/>
necessary to make box-to-box directions.  Please try to print yourself a set <br/>
of clues.  There should be at least one set per car.  We're going to caravan, <br/>
but in case someone gets seperated from the herd, every car should have a list <br/>
of where we're going.<br/>
<br/>
3.  There will be an event stamp.  There will also be a stamp for us to use <br/>
to communally stamp into the boxes.  The head count looks to be about 50, so <br/>
using one stamp to stamp in will probably speed up the process, along with the <br/>
fact that many of us already have a lot of these boxes.  :)<br/>
<br/>
4.  In the case of snow/sleet/all that lovely New England stuff, Mark and I <br/>
will make the decision by 9 pm the night before.  Please check Mark's page <br/>
(markandsuepepe.blogspot.com) to see if the drive is still on.  So far, it looks <br/>
good!<br/>
<br/>
Questions?  Ask me.  :)  <a href="mailto:davyschris@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">davyschris@...</a><br/>

Can't wait to see you all!<br/>
