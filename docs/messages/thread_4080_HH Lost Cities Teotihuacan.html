Mine was at Sleeping Giant.  Im trying to get all the boxes there:<br/>
<a href="http://sheltontrails.blogspot.com/2009/11/back-to-giant.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://sheltontrails.blogspot.com/2009/11/back-to-giant.html</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had the worst stealth situation Ive ever encountered.  I had just<br/>
finished stamping in about 20 feet from the hide, when a group of four<br/>
college student came and sat down between me and the hiding spot facing the<br/>
hiding spot.  They were so rude! There was so much space up there and they<br/>
just came in and practically sat on top of me, I mean, I could almost touch<br/>
them. They had French accents or something like it. Its like, when an<br/>
elevator opens and one person is inside, do you go stand right next to them,<br/>
or space yourself out? These people just did not get that.  And they would<br/>
not leave. I finally pulled out my cell phone and tried to be the obnoxious<br/>
cell phone user, but I was getting embarrassed at myself :-D.  Then I took<br/>
out my camera and started mulling about taking close up pictures in front of<br/>
them of grass heads and such like a dork. Finally, after about ½ hour, they<br/>
left and I was free to rehide. Phew!<br/>

Found this HH yesterday in the Bag Of Money box in Litchfield, CT. It only<br/>
arrived there the same day from the Woodland Paws box. Will move it along<br/>
soon.<br/>
A great day for boxing. We did 6 drive-bys. Not much hiking but it was just<br/>
nice to be out.<br/>
