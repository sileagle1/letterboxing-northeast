<br/>
FYI: Clues will only be distributed at the Letterboxing at Laudholm<br/>
gathering and afterwards by way of personal clue sheets, for various<br/>
reasons I'd like to stay away from publishing some of the boxes and/or<br/>
series that I have worked on for a while. I've spent 7 out of the 10<br/>
months that I have been letterboxing since last year working on this<br/>
series. It will be worth it, I promise.<br/>
<br/>
Bug Light was replaced for the season by Isosceles.<br/>
<br/>
Spring Point is doing just fine and has survived a hearty maine winter.<br/>
<br/>
Big Train has already had 3 visitors, congrats to MEPANJ first finders<br/>
- I'm happy to say that it is alive and well...though not sure how<br/>
long that might last. The log will need more frequent maintenance than<br/>
I originally thought.<br/>
<br/>
Stay tuned for an upcoming schedule of events planned for the<br/>
Letterboxing at Laudholm gathering. There will be at least 10 on-site<br/>
boxes that I've counted so far!<br/>
