<br/>
On Saturday (what a beautiful day!) I found, in good shape:<br/>
* Jack's Watering Hole<br/>
* Letterboxing Deer<br/>
* Sylvan Scholar<br/>
* Duct Tape and Whimsy<br/>
* Corny<br/>
* Children at Play<br/>
* The Graden Path<br/>
<br/>
Alas, time did not allow me to venture farther than the Bradley<br/>
Estate, where all of these boxes are located.<br/>
<br/>
On Sunday, I met up with Team Randalstick for a short afternoon of<br/>
'boxing and to place Wolf Hollow.  We found, in good shape:<br/>
* By the Sea Series<br/>
* Detectives 5 Series<br/>
* Alien (by Choi)<br/>
<br/>
We were unable to locate the cemetery box in Georgetown, MA (a number<br/>
of people have attempted this box throughout the summer so I'm pretty<br/>
confident it's gone), nor Spiral Sun in Andover.  RE: Sprial Sun,<br/>
however, we were hunting in the dark, so its likely it is there<br/>
despite our inability to find it.  It is a microbox, after all.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Eyjo (of Team Randalstik) for coming along with me!<br/>
