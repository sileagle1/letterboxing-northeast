Dave was home on a pass this weekend and we put a new stamp and inkpad in the box.<br/>
We really need to educate Geocachers about Letterboxes. A heart magnet was apparently left in place of  the somewhat moldy store-bought leaf stamp and well used inkpad. Doesn't seem much of a trade! ;)<br/>
But, then from what I've seen of Geocache boxes - there wouldn't be much to tempt me away from letterboxing and the wonderful stamp images I've been able to collect over the years.<br/>
By the way, we found the box and it's contents open and strewn about in the middle of the path. It is now well hidden in it's appropriate spot.<br/>
Three will have to be the magic number when it comes to von der Insel letterboxes, If this box goes missing again, we will have to call it a 'party spot' and find it a new location at the Sanctuary. It's such a wonderful spot to walk.<br/>
