Tremaine, Town Line, and My Favorite Winter Things at the same time, <br/>
the Route 2 Tunnel's water has receded!  (Just make sure that you plant <br/>
a car out on the Dickenson Road trailhead for Lady Tremaine!)<br/>
<br/>
On your way to Cruella, you go over the dirt bridge before the Y <br/>
intersection....  Look downhill to your right.  There's the tunnel.  <br/>
Rubaduc had fun today going through the tunnel!  Just make sure you <br/>
wear waterproof boots.... it's not totally out of water!  Once you go <br/>
through the tunnels for both the eastbound and westbound lanes, search <br/>
around... you should be near the last two boxes of Favorite Winter <br/>
Things!<br/>
<br/>
Since I  haven't done this yet.... I'm looking forward to it!  Maybe I <br/>
can get PSU Fan to go too......<br/>
