To all concerned,  there REALLY is a FISH -OR-MAN letterboxer !!  I<br/>
not only met him , but had the fun of boxing all day with him and<br/>
Bluebird.  I admit that the thought began in my head that FISH -OR<br/>
-MAN  was just a figment of Bluebird !!! Everytime we were to meet, <br/>
some unfore seen thing happened and he was not there.  Now I am happy<br/>
to report he is a gentle kind young man.  Quiet,  but Bluebird and I<br/>
do talk most of the time. We found many great boxes and the Gilbert<br/>
and Sullivan Series 2 and 3.  Thanks to Bell Lady especially for two<br/>
nice hikes. One a 'doozy'  Big Smile <br/>
FISH OR MAN , thank you for waiting patiently for this Old One to<br/>
catch up and your energy is perfect,  it was a fun day for me, and<br/>
Thanks Bluebird for finding such a wonderful young peson and bringing<br/>
him with you .<br/>
