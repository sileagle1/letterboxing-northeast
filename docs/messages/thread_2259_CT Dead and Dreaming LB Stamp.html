the lack of a stamp.  Unless the original placer objects, we have <br/>
carved and will be replacing his stamp this weekend. We adopted this <br/>
box so it would not disappear from the main list of clues back when <br/>
there was the big transition.  Thanks and Happy Boxing! Sunshine, and <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-698709323">Kreepy Kelli and I went to do this box and found it with no stamp.  We used <br/>
my digital camera to take a photo of the image of the stamp from the logbook, <br/>
so we can print it out and tape it in.  I figure that's legitmate.  I mean, we <br/>
did find the actual box.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone else who has found the box without the stamp wants a copy, email me <br/>
and I'll send it to you.  :)</div>
