I know as far as my local area most boxes are not posted on AQ.  Of my first 40 boxes found only 3 were on AQ.  I know we are not alone so I think cries  for help could be answered by the community via their cut and pasted summary pages.  Anyone need help I'll be glad to share.  : )<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Hey, guys.  OK, so we have an issue on our hands here.  I mean, AQ is great, <br/>
&gt; but we all know that there are lots of boxes that are only on LBNA, and while <br/>
&gt; we're still waiting for that to come up...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a bunch of clues on my hard drive for all around Connecticut.  The <br/>
&gt; reason is that when I go to a town, I cut and paste all the clues onto one sheet <br/>
&gt; in order to save ink and paper when printing.  I save these files because I <br/>
&gt; might want to print them out again next time I go.  So I have a lot.  I'm sure <br/>
&gt; other people have stashes as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was thinking of posting some of these to this list.  I'm not talking about <br/>
&gt; WOMs or anything.  I'm talking about clues that, up until a few days ago, were <br/>
&gt; online for the whole world to see.  What do you guys think?  General <br/>
&gt; consensus?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the meantime, if you're hoping to go to a particular place in CT, try <br/>
&gt; posting a cry for help here.  I'm sure someone can get back to you with the clues <br/>
&gt; you're asking for.  :)<br/>
