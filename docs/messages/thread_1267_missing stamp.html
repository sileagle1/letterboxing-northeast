On Sept. The Maplines found the box and noted the stamp missing.  If you <br/>
read this, please contact me off line and I will try to get you a copy <br/>

well hidden. I brought it home and  may make a new stamp and replace it. ??<br/>

MOST of the geocahing folks are very understanding of our hobby, even when it's not thier cup o' tea (as we are of theirs), but there's always some new geocachers who don't know who we are or what a letterbox does.  Even when we leave information in the box about "What is letterboxing?".  Don't let it darken your day.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  Sad to report , that The Wedding Rock stamp was taken by  a geocacher and he left a Travel bug , his name and number  and asked to get the bug moving .!  Well-  I do not know what to do with the travel bug - but would love to get my stamp back .  In the meantime , the box has been kindly pulled by Rubaduc and Gizz . No plans to re plant it at this time . The new log book is full of posts from geocachers  and only a few letterboxers . <br/>
