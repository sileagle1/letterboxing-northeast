If you are THINKING about coming to Maine - August would be a great <br/>
time to come and play! We have a wonderful location with some fun and <br/>
frivolity planned for the first weekend in August. If you are <br/>
planning on attending - and will be camping at Thomas Point Beach... <br/>
let them know you are with the MIDCOAST HIKERS. They are good with <br/>
a 'scavenger hunt' type of activity and actually are loaning us one <br/>
of theirs to use for the weekend - and you'll get a stamp if you do <br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
Teacup needs to know ASAP about the camping facilites your party <br/>
requires... tent site, RV site with or without power. Thomas Point is <br/>
making every attempt at clustering us together. If you are not <br/>
staying at the campground, you do have to exit the property by a <br/>
certain time (which is on their website.)<br/>
<br/>
Friday nights pregather is still in the planning stage - Saturday <br/>
night my drama queen daughter is hosting a haunted tour - 3 times, 3 <br/>
levels of haunting... LOTS of boxes coming from near and far... will <br/>
be planted for the weekend and for the future.<br/>
<br/>
So - if your looking for that perfect family boxing weekend and a <br/>
great reason to kick back in Maine... sign up and join in the fun and <br/>
frivolity!<br/>
