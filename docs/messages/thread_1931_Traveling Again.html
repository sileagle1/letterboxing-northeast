I've been a member of this Yahoo group for awhile, but mostly read <br/>
and don't post often. My partner and I are 'casual ' letterboxers. We <br/>
just reached " F 50 "  (Crowd cheers in background)  We have discovered <br/>
some wonderful places in Rhode Island, where we do most ofour <br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
This upcoming weekend, we will be traveling from RI to Oneida, NY. We <br/>
will be leaving RI at about 3pm Friday( 4/8) and returning during the <br/>
day on Tuesday ( 4/12). So we will be traveling along Rte 146 ( in RI ) <br/>
to Rte 90 ( in MA ) and would like to hear about any suggestions for <br/>
letterboxes along the way. Feel free to email me off list.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Lari &amp; Di</div>
