                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1590155285">I found a personal stamp and logbook near Hammonasset Beach in Ct. The <br/>
stamp says "Take Life By The Hornes". Someone wrote in the logbook that <br/>
they found it in a tree and returned it to it's location. There were <br/>
clues to the letterbox that I was looking for in the bag and the <br/>
logbook and stamp was where the letterbox should have been. (The <br/>
letterbox was missing).<br/>
If anyone knows who this belongs to, please let me know. <br/>
