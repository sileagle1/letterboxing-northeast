I'm new to the lbna community. I started late last summer. I live in <br/>
RI and I found my first letterbox in Virginia Beach while on vacation. <br/>
This August I'm going to California. I would like to leave a hitch <br/>
hiker there. In hope of it finding its way back home. Give me some <br/>
feed back on how to get this mission started. Can this be done. I hope <br/>
to plant my first letter box a soon as the rain stops. All your ideas <br/>
will be great.<br/>
Thanks</div>

There have been at least two X-country HH Races in the past year.  It <br/>
can be done.  I suggest you include instructions in your log book that <br/>
the HH was left in CA with hopes it will return to _________.  Please <br/>
move EAST as best you can.  Or something to that effect.<br/>
<br/>
I'm still waiting to hear about Rapido my Great HH Race entry.  I heard <br/>
he landed in Fort Walton Beach FL and I flew down there in hopes of <br/>
retreiving him (and visit a friend) but he had already been picked up <br/>
by someone from WI!!  Where oh where is my Rapido?<br/>
