I just got a job at Wadsworth Falls State Park on weekends.  I found out <br/>
today that the season passes for all the state parks are $40, and on June 29, <br/>
they're going to raise that to $50.  If you're planning on doing lots of boxing <br/>
this summer, this pass makes sense!  If you're planning to buy one, I'd suggest <br/>
stopping by a state park near you and picking one up before June 29.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Also... those among us who qualify for this probably already know, but if you <br/>
don't, here's some more good information:  Senior citizens can get in free to <br/>
the state parks!  You just have to get something called a Charter Oak Pass, <br/>
which is available to all seniors by sending in a copy of your CT drivers <br/>
lisence to the DEP.  Unfortunately, I didn't write the address down, but I'm sure <br/>
you could find it, or a good contact phone number, on the DEP website!<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing...<br/>
<br/>
And keep your eyes peeled for a limited time box you can get by stopping by <br/>
the Wadsworth Falls ticket booth on weekends this summer and saying hello to <br/>
me!  (I look fantastic in khaki and green.)  You might also want to work on my <br/>
Naxscio mystery box if you're going to be seeing me anytime in the near future. <br/>

  It was kind of you to pass on that info to everyone.  May I add to it .?  The Senior Pass - the Charter Oak - takes care of the whole car =  not just the senior .  As you might imagine, I have had one for many long years  and have enjoyed being to  so many outings  over the years because of my charming personality , ~~~or was it because of the Charter Oak Pass that allowed all my young friends to get in 'free ' ?  Everyone should have a pass  and make good use of it. our State Parks are loaded with letterboxes .  .<br/>
  Hope to see you some week end while you are working and I am playing <br/>
