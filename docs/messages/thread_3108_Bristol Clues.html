Easy walk:<br/>
This box is planted (at his favorite park) for my 5 year old (now <br/>
7)letterboxing<br/>
grandson, Jared, who is stronger, faster and more energetic than any<br/>
raptor I ever met.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to Rockwell Park: In Bristol, on Rt. 72 west go 0.6 mi. past<br/>
the Rt. 69 intersection, turning right onto Dutton Ave. park in front of<br/>
the playground.<br/>
<br/>
The usual routine of playing on the swings etc. comes first and then<br/>
follow the sidewalk north through the white gate and over the bridge,<br/>
turning left onto the fitness circuit. The large stone building straight<br/>
ahead of you when crossing the bridge once housed changing rooms and<br/>
concession stand when this was a swimming spot. Once on the gravel<br/>
circuit you'll see a good stamping in table on your left and a smaller<br/>
stone building ahead of you. Head towards this smaller building, and follow <br/>
the arrow on the tree up a few stairs. From the top stair count approximately <br/>
65 steps to a three foot high stump with an uprooted tree just beyond it. Jared <br/>
now hides in the roots of the tree under a piece of cement. Please be careful <br/>
not to be seen by walkers or by cars passing by on the road just above you. <br/>
This is Jareds last chance not to become extinct.<br/>
Thank you <br/>

Page Park Ski Tow<br/>
by Music Woman<br/>
Find Page Park on Route 229 across from Bristol Eastern High School. Park in <br/>
the first lot on the left. Walk past the basketball court and go up the hill. <br/>
You will notice that this wide path used to be the ski slope. The poles are <br/>
still visible with the wheels for the ski tow still attached. Once at the top of <br/>
the hill, at the last pole, go over the paved road onto a path. Go through <br/>
the first 4-way intersection and at the second (almost immediately after the <br/>
first) go left. Walk 15 paces up the trail and bushwack right 4 paces to small <br/>
pieces of ledge. Your prize is hidden between two small pieces of ledge under <br/>
sticks.<br/>

planted 9-27-02 by Rubaduc<br/>
pretty easy..maybe an hour<br/>
<br/>
This box is planted as a tribute to my summer letterboxing companion, my <br/>
grandson Will.<br/>
Thank you, Will for all the good times.<br/>
<br/>
Sweet William (according to Webster) is a biennial plant having bracteate <br/>
heads of brightly colored flowers.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: From Rt.6 in Bristol turn East onto Hill St. go 0.8 mi. to James <br/>
P. Casey Rd. and go right. After 0.6 mi. you'll see the Chippens Hill Middle <br/>
School on your left and shortly on your right, a parking area.<br/>
<br/>
Clues: From your car walk down the paved road till you come to a path on the <br/>
right, follow this through an open meadow, watching the hill in front of you. <br/>
There are several trails leading up the hill but you want the one furthest to <br/>
the left (you will have to cut across the grass to achieve this). At the top, <br/>
at the tree line there's a white blazed trail going both ways, follow it to <br/>
your right. This area is known as "The Hoppers" because of the "kettle holes" <br/>
left 12,000 years ago during the ice age. As the ice receded over the gravel <br/>
ground, it left huge depressions called hoppers, which you can see on both sides <br/>
of the trail as you start walking into the woods. Staying on the white trail <br/>
the whole way you'll soon see a blue trail enter and join the white for awhile. <br/>
Just before going down a sandy slope you'll see tin discs on the trees to <br/>
mark the trail. Blue goes left and white stays straight. Take the white. Some of <br/>
this area has been devastated by motorized vehicles, but used to be beautiful <br/>
hiking trails, I did scare up a deer however. After a while you can start <br/>
looking for a cement marker close to the ground on your right (there are a couple <br/>
before this on the left). X marks the spot (almost) from this marker count off <br/>
20 steps and find a path on your left. 15 steps down this path leads you to a <br/>
small, fallen tree and at it's base you'll find the Sweet William plant. <br/>
Stamp in, rehide carefully and return to the path. Just ahead is a pretty decent <br/>
overlook with some houses below but I'd suggest returning the way you came <br/>
unless you know the area. When I got back to the blue trail I took that straight <br/>
ahead and came out to the same hilltop but took a different path down.</div>
