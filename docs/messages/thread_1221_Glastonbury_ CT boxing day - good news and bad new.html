                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-328488421">Had a great day in Glastonbury today. I got 17 for 17 boxes! Did Old <br/>
Route 2 Gas Station before Music Woman pulls it. (My appologies to <br/>
her for following the last person who stamped in backwards and upside <br/>
down and did it myself!) I then went to Shoddy Mill, got a little <br/>
confused, but found the box farther along the trail than I thought. <br/>
The box was left out on the ground, not hidden at all. Thankfully, it <br/>
was off the trail quite a bit so no one could see it. I then went to <br/>
Frog Pond at Cotton Hollow. That was also much farther down the trail <br/>
than I thought. Next to the Audubon Center for Sunshine Daydream and <br/>
Audubon boxes. I was there before the center opened, but got lucky <br/>
when one of the ladies who works there arrived just as I was getting <br/>
ready to leave, and she let me in to get the bonus box. I next <br/>
visited the bats at Poppy's Riverside Bat House. I looked into the <br/>
house, but could not see any bats. They must have been way up inside. <br/>
Going to Candlewick Kennels to get Casey-Girl was a moving <br/>
experience. If you have been there, you know what I mean. My last <br/>
stop was at Blackledge Falls for the Good Grief! series. Went from <br/>
Schroder right to Lucy by mistake. I missed four boxes in-between! <br/>
Found them on my hike back, though. What a beautiful spot. I wish I <br/>
had read the clues before I left home, since they mentioned <br/>
Deertracks in the Snow. Oh well, just an excuse to go back! All the <br/>
boxes that I visited today were in good health, but on a sadder note, <br/>
several along the Good Grief! trail were exposed. One was not hidden <br/>
at all, just left behind a tree, and others with 4 or 5 small sticks <br/>
that did not cover the boxes in the least. If anyone knows the <br/>
Lamberts of Glastonbury who use a frog stamp with a top hat and cane, <br/>
please explain to them the importance of covering the boxes <br/>
completely. They were the last ones to stamp in and since this has <br/>
been such a hot topic lately, maybe it's time to name names! Anyway, <br/>
I will be going to Hartman with Flutterby tomorrow and meeting up <br/>
with Butterfly there. Can't wait!<br/>

Wow! You sure had a productive day!  Thanks for the update on my Good Grief! series and Casey Girl; and for the reminder of how important it is to rehide boxes well.  Blessings, MayEve<br/>
