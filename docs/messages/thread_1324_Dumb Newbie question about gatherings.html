<br/>
As far as Clues for the Monster Mash - Chuck &amp; Molly will be posting <br/>
the clues October 1st on their website <a href="http://www.chuckstraub.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.chuckstraub.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
I think because this is such a HUGE gathering, with over 100 1-month-<br/>
only letterboxes (well, some letterboxes may be replanted in other <br/>
areas but that's besides the point)...I highly doubt that someone <br/>
will be printing out 100-300 sheets of clues, making copies, and <br/>
having them on hand for anybody to take is a bit farfetched -- but <br/>
some clues may be printed out and made ready at the gathering for <br/>
letterboxers - I'm not sure if that will happen or not.  There's too <br/>
many boxes for one person to do in one day, not to mention the fact <br/>
that there are other contests at the gathering pavilion...as well as <br/>
the overwhelming amount of people attending...<br/>
<br/>
*takes a breath of air*<br/>
<br/>
Anywho, I would just print out a portion of boxes so you have clues <br/>
with you - I don't think clues will be available at the event (some <br/>
letterboxes might have clues to them, like day-only ones or <br/>
whatever), but it's best to take out insurance and have clues to <br/>
however many boxes you'd like to search for - or any certain ones <br/>
that spark your interest (may I suggest the 'Carrie' letterbox by me <br/>
&amp; Pigtographer? hee hee, just kidding)...<br/>
<br/>
Pigtographer and I have been to 6 or 7 gatherings/mini gatherings <br/>
(some that had clues available, some where you had to bring your <br/>
own), and I think our plan of action is to split up the day - I'm <br/>
under the assumption that Chuck and his cohosts will have all the <br/>
boxes planted before the clues are online and before the gathering <br/>
starts.  Pigtographer and I will probably print up 10-25 clues for <br/>
different boxes (multiple box series' are always fun) and box before <br/>
the gathering (early Saturday morning) and maybe a little bit into <br/>
the gathering - then the latter half we will most likely meeting new <br/>
and old letterboxers alike.  Everybody has their own agenda - and <br/>
people will be in and out of the gathering all day, so just do what's <br/>
best for you and your troupe of letterboxers and enjoy the gathering!<br/>
<br/>
Being me, I'm probably rambling on, so to finish it off: look through <br/>
the clues on Friday, October 1st, find some that you and your <br/>
relatives might be interested in and print them out prior to the <br/>
gathering the next day.  Make sure not to forget anything you might <br/>
need, and enjoy the experience that is a gathering, not to mention <br/>
that if there are very few or no clues available at the gathering - <br/>
you will have clues on hand...and you won't be like Pigtographer -<br/>
(this is not, I repeat, not a mockery, because Pigtographer herself <br/>
say this alllll the time...) you won't be "clueless" in more than one <br/>
way. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I havn't posted in a while, so I think this post makes up for the <br/>
time I didn't post.  Time to go back to being quiet before someone <br/>
hits me for continuously typing and typing...I think I just wrote an <br/>
essay out of an extremely simple sentence which could have been <br/>
answered in a few sentences.  Oh well.  I guess it takes a few of us <br/>
a bit longer to explain things!<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps (or, maybe it just got you more confused...)<br/>
