so i have been out trying to plant the last few boxes for my gathering, <br/>
and couldn't help but wonder how many people might actually be out <br/>
searching for boxes right now. since i first started planting for the <br/>
gathering, it has snowed twice, amounting in about 1 1/2 feet. i know <br/>
there are people whom don't let a little snow get them down, but i <br/>
couldn't help but wonder.<br/>

(Mansfield &amp; Tolland CT) We did a couple boxes yesterday.The first one Chickabirdie held an umbrella to keep everything dry while I did the stamping. Amy just poked and ran around, she loves this stuff. The other one was sort of a drive by where I could take the box inside the car, do my stamping and bring it back. <br/>
