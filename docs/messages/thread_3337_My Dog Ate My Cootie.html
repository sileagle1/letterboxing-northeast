will talk.  Personally I think they are covering for each other.  <br/>
<br/>
I was in another room busy on my computer and sort of heard the sound <br/>
of the cootie's destruction but I thought it was just one of the <br/>
dogs' toys.  By the time the sound registered in my brain that it was <br/>
not a dog toy all that was left was the metal ring and two shredded <br/>
pieces of pink plastic.  When I walked into the kitchen neither dog <br/>
was anywhere near the crime site.<br/>

PS the new dog's name is Gina.  Gina does have a history of eating <br/>
just about anything so she is the primary suspect.  Indy is not off <br/>
the hook because she has been known to eat items made of paper, <br/>
especially if they smell good.<br/>

Little Amy tried to do the same thing to HHs on our table but I was lucky enough to stop her. She's also tried to take stuff while out letterboxing. Puppies poke around everything so you never know what she'll find interesting. When she gets too active at a box I tie her to a tree until we're finished. Now we have what I think is a puppy proof place for things like HHs.  Hoping we never have to experience Amy getting her paws and teeth on letterboxing stuff......Chuck, Chickabirdie and Amy <br/>
