there and was sad to discover my Oak Hill box missing! It looks like<br/>
they did some serious groundswork thus raking up my box. Alas...I<br/>
guess that is what makes these little boxes so special..the fleeting<br/>
pleasure of this bit of temporary art.<br/>
<br/>
I will recarve and replace (maybe more then one since it is such a<br/>
fabulous cememtery) most likely over the winter/early spring. Thanks<br/>
to all of you who visited this box! I had been checking my log book<br/>
and got a lot of great comments there and via email. I was glad to<br/>
have shared this great spot with you all!<br/>
