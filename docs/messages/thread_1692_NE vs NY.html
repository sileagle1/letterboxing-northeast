www.alltheweb.com to seek an answer:  there are as many as there are <br/>
states!<br/>

l      not only includes NY in the NE, but PA &amp; NJ -- which we know <br/>
belong to LBMA!<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.quia.com/jg/211159list.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.quia.com/jg/211159list.html</a>      and this one adds in MD <br/>
DE &amp; PA --- I guess anything NORTH of the Mason Dixon Line and in the <br/>
EASTern Time Zone qualifies here.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.onour.com/instruction/northeast.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.onour.com/instruction/northeast.htm</a>      and they are <br/>
teaching the kids in St Louis MO the same as previous site.<br/>
<br/>
It comes down to what are the geographical AREAS of the US (as <br/>
mentioned in a previous post).<br/>
If it is NE SW NCentral SCentral and Western it seems to fall to the <br/>
Mason Dixon Line division and time zones<br/>
<br/>
But since we have a Mid-Atlantic area in LBNA, the question is how <br/>
far South is North?  <br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_States" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_States</a>   IDs Mid-Atl as DE <br/>
MD PA VA NJ NY &amp; DC (what happened to WV?)<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://geology.er.usgs.gov/states/mid_atl.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://geology.er.usgs.gov/states/mid_atl.html</a>     adds WV<br/>

If you didn't vote the earlier poll - the voting is over, and that's <br/>
what you got (Bush for Pres....No, I mean, NY is in the NE)<br/>
<br/>
If you did vote the earlier poll and 'lost', you are in America, be <br/>
glad you got to express yourself!<br/>
