Glad to hear that the O Letterbox Tree survived. We are planning a New Year's Eve weekend trip to the Cape to letterbox and will make that one of our first stops on the 31st (hint, hint, don't take the "ornaments" down too early....)<br/>

  Just a request that when people are sharing information such as weather, hiking conditions, etc., it is helpful to include where you are from.  Even though I've been involved with letterboxing for a while now, I don't have a good sense in my head of where everyone is from.  The weather reports are interesting, but would be even more so if I had a clue what the locations were!<br/>
<br/>
  For those who might be interested, Mount Desert Island and Acadia National Park received between 8 and 10 inches by the looks.  Wet snow that stuck to everything and made for a gorgeous commute yesterday morning.  I, for one, will have my fingers crossed for a wonderfully snowy winter here on the island so that I can take lots of beautiful photographs!  While the snow may make stealhy letterboxing difficult, we can always scout out potential new locations while enjoying the beauty of winter.  I think I like winter hiking more than summer. (Which may be due in part to the lack of tourists here on the island now!)<br/>

I totally agree. In fact, one of the best hikes we had last year was<br/>
in the middle of a snowstorm on the island. It was beautiful. I only<br/>
wish I had bought my snowshoes prior to that. Now we have them and are<br/>
prepared for any storm. It's great to live in the middle of the woods<br/>
when it snows and you can just walk out your back door.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Subject: [LbNE] Snowshoes<br/>
&gt; &gt;Date: Mon, 12 Dec 2005 00:12:52 -0000<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Hi Phyto,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;    I've already asked a few people what snowhoes they like and now I <br/>
&gt; &gt;wonder what you<br/>
&gt; &gt;look for in a pair? I have no clue but I think that would be fun to own a <br/>
&gt; &gt;pair. If anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt;could educate me on this subject, I'd be grateful. Thanks!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Take care, Orion<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I think I like winter hiking more than summer. (Which may be due in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; part to the lack of tourists here on the island now!)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I totally agree. In fact, one of the best hikes we had last year was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the middle of a snowstorm on the island. It was beautiful. I only<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wish I had bought my snowshoes prior to that. Now we have them and are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; prepared for any storm. It's great to live in the middle of the woods<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; when it snows and you can just walk out your back door.<br/>

   I planted a tribute box to my Mom on the Cape. It's at a beautiful beach, completely safe <br/>

anyone would look for it at night but it was in jeopardy of going MIA. Fortunately one of <br/>

 If I thought about it too much, I'd probally never plant anywhere but in my own yard!!!<br/>

you transfer stress off of your knees and legs to your arms and <br/>

get a bit of an upper body workout! I've read that using trekking <br/>

the end of a hard day of hiking since I started using trekking poles. <br/>

Ocean State -- they're cheap, but that way I won't feel bad if I lose <br/>

I also saw that they have "Freshness Keepers" -- a "Lock 'n' Load" <br/>

&gt; I don't know about $7 trekking poles (I paid $80 for mine at EMS), <br/>
but<br/>
&gt; I've been having a hard time learning how to use them properly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Very difficult to get the right rhythym ... my legs move faster <br/>
than<br/>

&gt; &gt; I saw that Ocean State Job Lot in Canton has collapsible <br/>
trekking <br/>
&gt; &gt; poles on sale for just $6.88 each. This is a great price for a <br/>
&gt; &gt; starter trekking pole, so if you've ever wanted to try them, <br/>
this is <br/>
&gt; &gt; a good chance! FYI, every time you plant a trekking pole as you <br/>
walk, <br/>
&gt; &gt; you transfer stress off of your knees and legs to your arms and <br/>
&gt; &gt; shoulders. As a result, you get less stress on knee joints, and <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; &gt; get a bit of an upper body workout! I've read that using <br/>
trekking <br/>
&gt; &gt; poles when going downhill can result in up to 40% less strain on <br/>
your <br/>
&gt; &gt; knees, and I really have noticed a difference on my own weak <br/>
knees at <br/>
&gt; &gt; the end of a hard day of hiking since I started using trekking <br/>
poles. <br/>
&gt; &gt; I've actually been using the exact same pole as the ones sold at <br/>
&gt; &gt; Ocean State -- they're cheap, but that way I won't feel bad if I <br/>
lose <br/>
&gt; &gt; one (again) or break one (again)... &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I also saw that they have "Freshness Keepers" -- a "Lock 'n' <br/>
Load" <br/>
&gt; &gt; type container. The 30 oz version is just $1.29. I picked one up <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; &gt; test it out, but it seems promising at a good price.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I imagine that the other Ocean State stores in CT and RI may <br/>
have <br/>
&gt; &gt; these, as well.<br/>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>I generally use mine by planting a pole only once per pace (er, <br/>
that's 2 steps &lt;g&gt;), instead of with every footfall. If I'm climbing <br/>
or descending a hill, I'll plant a pole with each footfall of the opposite leg.<br/>
<br/>
Another tip -- the strap on the handle isn't supposed to go around <br/>
your wrist. The strap is supposed to go around the palm of your hand <br/>
(between your thumb and index finger), and then be reasonably tight <br/>
against your hand. Then you grasp the handle with the strap in <br/>
between your hand and the handle. Now you don't have to clinch your <br/>
hand so tightly to hold onto the pole. (In Nordic walking, your hand <br/>
is supposed to open completely off the grip when you bring it <br/>
forward, but that's way too complicated for me!)<br/>
