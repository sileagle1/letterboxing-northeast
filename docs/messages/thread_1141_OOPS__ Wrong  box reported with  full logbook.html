box, but rather, the first box of the Green Falls Pond series (also a <br/>
Drewclan production) We added a new logbook to the second box, but <br/>
didn't have time to do it in the first- there were hikers right <br/>
behind us. Anyone planning to go there might like to bring a new <br/>
logbook or two along :0) It has been a popular series- rightfully so- <br/>
What a beautiful place!!! Thanks to DC once again!!</div>
