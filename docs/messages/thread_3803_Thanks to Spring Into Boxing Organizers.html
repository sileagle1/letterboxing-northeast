It was great seeing some friends from the past (like that ever-smiling<br/>

think the longest distance travelers award would go to Happy Daze,<br/>
from Saco, ME and Talking Turtle from NY.<br/>

MayEve, RTRW, Music Woman and Wild Rover sure know how to show a letterboxer a great time!  Mind you, there is a lot of work involved in the planning, so thank you all for your time and efforts.  You're the best!<br/>
