I'm pretty much a backpacker when it comes to camping, but some of my favorite family campgrounds are in Connecticut . try Strawberry Park for some thing different, Sutton Fall Campground in Sutton MassachusettsFriends of mine, and Woodland Acres in Brownfield, Maine if you like canoeing, their right on the Saco River.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great trip<br/>

Large, friendly campgound, with lots of amenities, and<br/>
buses that circulates to all the campgrounds and takes<br/>
you to the beach for like 50 cents per person.  (11<br/>

quite nearby and there are LOTS of boxes there. <br/>

town of Deep River.  On the map of Connecticut find Rt. 148 about <br/>
half way between I-95 and Rt. 82.  Rt. 148 crosses the CT river via a <br/>
ferry.  Right next to (north of) the ferry slip is a boat launch.  <br/>
It's sandy and labeled by the state as "carry in" only, ie, for <br/>
canoes and kayaks only but with a 4x4 you can launch a small boat (I <br/>
launch my 14' Lund and my 17' Whaler all the time).  Selden Neck is <br/>
about 3/4 of a mile down stream on the east side of the river and <br/>
extends for about another 1-1/2 miles south the west side of the <br/>
island is the CT river, the east side is Selden Creek which is only <br/>
about 40'or 50' feet wide except for the northeast end which is <br/>
Selden Cove which is a couple acres big but very shallow.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-658797944">Hi we have two favorite campgrounds to share.  The very  best is Burton <br/>
Island State Park on Lake Champlain.  You can stay in a tent  or a lean-to and can <br/>
only get there by boat.  There are a fair number of  boxes in the Lake <br/>
Champlain area and even a few on Burton Island!  You can  take your own boat (any <br/>
size-canoe, rowboat, sailboat, motor boat- we took a 13  foot Boston Whaler) or <br/>
there is a ferry that will transport you and your  gear.<br/>
<br/>
Another favorite of ours is in the White Mountains  (NH)-Crawford Notch <br/>
Campground and General Store is close to all of the  mountains and trails in the <br/>
White Mtn. National Forest, near North Conway and  tons of boxes!  We go up <br/>
every year for Columbus Day weekend and have  barely put a dent in our pile of <br/>
letterboxing clues.  Great location,  something for everyone from kids to adults <br/>
and hikes for all ability  levels.<br/>
<br/>
Hope these suggestions help!<br/>
<br/>

The clown image, made up of the 4 stamps, was so perfect! Thanks for <br/>
planting. <br/>
I agree, it was wonderful to see letterboxing friends we have not <br/>
caught up with for a while (including you).<br/>

a chance to box, my children really enjoyed both the fair and the <br/>
search for "Krusty" the clown, this past Saturday.   It was a gorgeous <br/>
day and a delightfully easy going crowd.   My daughters really hammed <br/>
up the necessity for clandestine actions as they tried to retrieve and <br/>
rehide the boxes.   The "torso" of "Krusty" proved to be the most <br/>
difficult to obtain as there were several spectators leaning on the <br/>
Cedar tree near its location, watching the horse-pull.   The girls <br/>
waited 10 minutes for the observers to move away so they could retrieve <br/>
their prize.   We had as much fun trying to be sneaky as we did at the <br/>
fair itself.   As a added bonus, being "locals" to the area, we were <br/>
able to hop over to Donutz' tag sale and purchase a few goodies as well <br/>
as stamp her special event stamp.</div>
