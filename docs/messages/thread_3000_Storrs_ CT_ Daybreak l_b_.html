planted by Leader of the Pack and newly refurbished by Chuck and Molly <br/>
last fall during the replace/refurbish/replant Leader of the Pack <br/>
boxes campaign sitting out in the open.  It was full of water and the <br/>
lid was tossed on the ground near by. I took the box home and will <br/>
contact Carolyn re. possible replanting it in a less conspicuous spot. <br/>
(When I found it and stamped in a year or so ago, it was also very <br/>
visible.) I'll send her the stamp-ins of new visters.<br/>
