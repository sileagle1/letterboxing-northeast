  Have the amount of letterboxers declined in CT over the years?  I revisited the Airline Trail letterbox in Amston and only 5 entries in 2005.  Box was planted in 2003 and there were many visitors in that year and 2004.  I've noticed this trend in many of the boxes that I've found in the past 6 months or so.  There are regulars in all the boxes - 5 or 6 boxers.  It's interesting and wondering if others have found the same stats...<br/>
<br/>
    By the way, this box is a great carving by rtrw and if you haven't gotten it, it's a "must have"!  <br/>

(I had found it previously, so I didn't relog my find on LBNA)  The box was in pretty good condition.<br/>

My guess is that when a new box is placed, the active boxers rush <br/>
right out to find it.  Then they don't return as they have found it <br/>
already.  Maybe after a couple of years the only ones looking for a <br/>
box would be new boxers.  So the count of visitors would depend on <br/>
how many new boxers join the hobby each year, as well as how many <br/>
experienced boxers are taking several years to get all the boxes in <br/>
Connecticut.<br/>
<br/>
That would explain a rush of visitors in the first year or so.<br/>
<br/>
RTRW did a great stamp for me to replace the broken original.  <br/>
Thanks RTRW.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Have the amount of letterboxers declined in CT over the years?  <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; &gt; revisited the Airline Trail letterbox in Amston and only 5 <br/>
entries <br/>
&gt; &gt; in 2005.  Box was planted in 2003 and there were many visitors in <br/>
&gt; &gt; that year and 2004.  I've noticed this trend in many of the boxes <br/>
&gt; &gt; that I've found in the past 6 months or so.  There are regulars <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; &gt; all the boxes - 5 or 6 boxers.  It's interesting and wondering if <br/>
&gt; &gt; others have found the same stats...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;    <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   By the way, this box is a great carving by rtrw and if you <br/>
&gt; &gt; haven't gotten it, it's a "must have"!  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;    <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Enjoy!<br/>
