It was later in the year, so there was little underbrush (and not a lot of blazes) to mark it.  After a while we decided to postpone the search and did another box elsewhere.  Maybe now, there's more underbrush to indicate where the trail is?<br/>

</span></blockquote>Yes. The clues say to go straight at the first intersection, but the<br/>
intersection that is described is actually the second. So go right at<br/>
the first, and straight (or left) at the second. Got that?<br/>
<br/>
You might want to wait until the first box is replaced, though.<br/>
Haven't heard back from the placer yet about what she would like to do.<br/>
