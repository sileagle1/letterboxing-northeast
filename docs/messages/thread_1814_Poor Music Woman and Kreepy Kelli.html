Where is that Purple Heart for Letterboxing? Today Pam and <br/>
Kelli were in a bad accident en route to a letterbox in Salem. <br/>
Butterfly and I were just behind them, in separate cars! Pam is <br/>
ok but sore - am waiting on a report about Kelli. Everyone should <br/>

Where is that Purple Heart for Letterboxing? Today Pam and <br/>
Kelli were in a bad accident en route to a letterbox in Salem. <br/>
Butterfly and I were just behind them, in separate cars! Pam is <br/>
ok but sore - am waiting on a report about Kelli. Everyone should <br/>

Kelli, however, is much sorer (is that a word?) than I am, especially<br/>
since she is already nursing a previous condition from another<br/>
accident.  We were both sent by ambulance to Lawrence and Memorial in<br/>
New London, where we spent hours in the emergency.  Needless to say, we<br/>
won't be boxing for a while.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think Kelli's had the purple heart LB, though I've already<br/>
received it.  My injury the first time was much tamer than this one, so<br/>
I really think I earned it this time!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for all of your prayers, and a special THANK YOU to<br/>
Butterfly and Bluebird for helping us in a scary situation.  Butterfly<br/>
and Bluebird stayed with my car until my brother and sister-in-law<br/>
showed up with his flat bed tow truck, and tried to keep us calm during<br/>
the ordeal.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone for your e-mails!  I hope to see all of you soon!<br/>
