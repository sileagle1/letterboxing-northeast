I thought I would say hello and introduce myself. I am pretty new to <br/>
letterboxing -- read about it for the past five years in various <br/>

boyfriend and niece last summer (Wompatuck and Webb in MA). Got all <br/>

niece could come along again .... and embarrassingly, here it is the <br/>
almost end of April without ever having LB'ed again.<br/>
<br/>
But this year I am going all the way! I found some pink stuff, got <br/>
some linoleum cutters (perhaps better named, finger stabbers), <br/>
plunged myself into the Abyss of Carving Humility by checking out <br/>
the artistry of TGD, Chuck and Molly, et al., and am ready this week <br/>
to carve sig stamp, traveller/exchange/friendship stamp, plus I am <br/>
way psyched to plant some boxes, like a Bridge Troll series, inter <br/>

<br/>
Still trying to get various beloveds as equally pumped -- but so <br/>
far, the boyfriend is less than enthused -- all he will consider for <br/>
a team name is Team Honda (he is a motorcycle fanatic ...). *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I work right near the Arnold Arboretum (JP area/Boston), so <br/>
as soon as I get the stamps carved, I will be dashing out at lunch <br/>
to do the two (maybe more?) boxes there and posting the breathlessly <br/>
dorky box updates that are the hallmark of we endorphin-drunk <br/>
