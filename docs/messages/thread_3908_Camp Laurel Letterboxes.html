                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-870212107"> Recently there were 4 letterboxes planted at Camp Laurel Girl Scout Camp in Lebanon and they are listed on the LBNA site . These boxes were planted by scouts .  This is private property and people have asked how they can get these boxes .<br/>
<br/>
I have talked to the caretaker at Camp Laurel . I work there in the summer and I am a Girl Scout Leader . The care taker has asked that people not come to the camp and ask to look for the boxes . This is private property . The camp is used all year long . There is a HUGE insurance issue for non Scouts .  There are CAmporees most of the year after that the camp is open to conferences and workshops for all scouts and leaders. <br/>
<br/>
I have written to the planter and asked that the listing of the boxes be removed from the LBNA site . I have not received a response. They can keep the boxes there but not list them for the public to see. <br/>
<br/>
There are  other boxes at this camp .  I am the keeper of  them and I check on them every summer . The clues are for Girl Scouts only . Most troops know this.<br/>
<br/>
I have emailed the LBNA webmaster  and asked them to remove the listing of these boxes and why ......The webmaster has removed them .<br/>
