We're looking for box donations for the WNY Gathering in August. The<br/>
theme is "Just Get Out There and Box" (a saying I'm pretty sure I<br/>
ripped off someone!). Any box having to do with games or recreation (in<br/>
or outdoor) is fine. Contact us offlist if you're interested...oh, and<br/>
feel free to come to the gathering, too! It's in Rochester, NY, which<br/>
might not be a big a haul for some of you as it sounds. It's only an<br/>
hour and a half from Syracuse, so it's not that bad a drive for some of <br/>
you (I know the Monster Mash was 6 hours for us, but well worth the <br/>
trip!). Here's the link:<br/>
