Eastford yesterday.  Thanks to Pine Tree for letting me know how <br/>
lovely it is here! I can't wait to hike here when all the streams <br/>
must be waded across v.s. being "skated" across. We went past...way <br/>
past the letterbox hiding spot but did find it during our backtrack. <br/>
All in all, a totally invigorating afternoon our in the woods. <br/>
(Thanks Chuck and Molly for the incentive (a.k.a. letterbox) to get <br/>
here).<br/>
