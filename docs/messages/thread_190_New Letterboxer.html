Hi Merenwen!<br/>
<br/>
Just make sure you have lots of room in your log for "exchanges" (though some <br/>
use a different log for exchanges.). CSCM and I look forward to meeting new <br/>
folks and seeing  familiar friendly faces.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>

bring something for the pot luck luncheon table, and if you have any <br/>
hitchhikers in your possession, I will be providing a hitchhiker <br/>
hostel for the event.<br/>
<br/>
And, as noted previously, this is a NO PETS gathering (sorry dog <br/>
owners!)<br/>
