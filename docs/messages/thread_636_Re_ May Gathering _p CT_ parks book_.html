part of it....deliverd a signed  copy of an extrememely informative <br/>
photo and mapfilled book to me  entitled "A Shared Landscape: A guide <br/>
to Ct.'s State Parks and Forests" by Joseph Leary.  The proceeds go <br/>
to the parks via The Friends of CT. State Parks, Inc. I'm pleased to <br/>
have spent the money to buy this resource book and recommend it to <br/>
you all. Please refer back to Sunshine as to where it is available. <br/>
though. (Putting you on the spot Sunshine-hope you don't mind)<br/>
