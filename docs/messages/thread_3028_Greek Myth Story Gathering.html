<br/>
Thanks also for all of the great boxes!  The hikes were long and hard, but it was nice to accomplish!  I would love to go back to "Mt. Olympus" some day and see the overlooks in sunny weather!<br/>
<br/>
It was also nice to meet so many new people.  Kudos to Eidolon and Artemis for trekking all of the way from Georgia for this event!  Kudos also to those from Maine!<br/>
<br/>
The bonfire was SO much fun!  Thanks Kelli for the smores and thanks to the Pointed Thinkers for the wine, and thanks to Maine Kokopellian for the fireside chats!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the GREAT gather!<br/>
