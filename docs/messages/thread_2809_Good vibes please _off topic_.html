Stiff, set to open in June in Hartford, CT.  If I get in, I'll have a <br/>
letterbox there at the play for those who come to see it.  :)  <br/>
<br/>
I hate auditioning... such a necessary evil for anyone doing theatre, though!<br/>

Don't forget about Hillel's box at his performances of Anything Goes this <br/>
month in Manchester!<br/>
