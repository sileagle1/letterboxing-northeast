NH. I spoke to the girl scout council around here (which I am a member of) and found the <br/>
troop disbanded quite a while ago and there was no way to reach the original members.    I <br/>
adopted this box over the box in the winter and finally back went up and replaced the entire <br/>
box.  I didn't want the you folks to get a poor impression of girl scout letterboxers :) (FYI <br/>
there wasn't a box- just a baggy with a stamp and inkpad..hence all the water)  There is now <br/>
a hand carved stamp and a dry log book. and a lock and lock box.  So, if anyone wants to get <br/>
a new impression for that location - it is up and running! I know several of you visited there- <br/>
but where underwhelmed by the stamp and condition of the box.  You should be much <br/>
happier with it now.  My daughter will be up in camp in that area this summer - so if there <br/>
are any problems with it - please tell me as I will be around there a few times to pick her up <br/>
and drop her off.<br/>

year I think and was really disappointed in the condition of what was <br/>
there.  Being an old Girl Scout myself I couldn't believe someone <br/>
would be so careless about their own "child".  At least now we have <br/>
an explanation as to why it happened and perhaps I'll make it up <br/>
there again some time. Thanks again.<br/>
