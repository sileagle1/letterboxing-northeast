seek monsters. I truly appreciate the company. My apologies to the <br/>
couple who allowed me to go ahead of them as they were doing clues to <br/>
boxes I had completed. (But I got it in the end because I missed a <br/>
paragraph in reading the clues I was doing and had to head back where <br/>
upon we met up again. They then bypassed me and finished out their <br/>
series before I could catch up to them!!! LOL)  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you Catlover/teacher/gardener for braving the stream (in both <br/>
directions!!!) for that one outstanding monster stamp!!<br/>
<br/>
Finally, thank you to Tony and Veronica for supplying a band aide and <br/>
ointment when I cut myself on a new ink pad opening it with a knife.<br/>
<br/>
Heybecause of everyone, I smiled all the way back to New York!!! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks...Take cre out there.<br/>
