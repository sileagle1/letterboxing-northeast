                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-382799181">Just an FYI -- on tomorrow, Friday the 15th Sept. the Archery Deer <br/>
Hunting Season opens in Conn.  Please check the CT DEP website (look <br/>
at the hunting abstracts) for particulars about all CT hunting season <br/>
dates.  (NOTA BENE: not all hunters must wear orange, in certain <br/>
situations/seasons they may wear camo).<br/>
<br/>
I recommend anyone going into the woods during any hunting season <br/>
should wear blaze orange visible from all sides: hat and <br/>
vest/sweatshirt; at the very least a blaze orange hat.  <br/>
If you see a vehicle parked near where you intend to box, be aware <br/>
that a hunter or two could be in the area.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Be aware, be safe and get out and box!<br/>

Thank you for the reminder. I was planning on some trips but will revise the <br/>
areas. <br/>
In orange I will look like a pumpkin. LOL...Maybe I can find a tam with a <br/>
green top.<br/>
<br/>
Yikes..this is what happens when it is raining and I want to be outside <br/>
playing. GRRRRR<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-977922697">Most archers are dedicated ethical hunters.  Hunting deer with a bow <br/>
requires the hunter to get up close and personal, excellent stalking <br/>
skills or a good tree stand are a must.  Most shots taken with a bow <br/>
are less than 40 yards so there's little chance of mistaking the <br/>
target.  As connfederate says blaze orange is always a good idea but I <br/>
worry a lot more about the shotgun, rifle hunters than the archers <br/>
(and a whole lot more about the poachers).</div>
