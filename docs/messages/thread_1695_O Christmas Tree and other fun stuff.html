<br/>
m &amp; m and I were so excited to take off this morning intent on <br/>
finding the O Christmas Tree series before its gone (even though I <br/>
SHOULD have been home cleaning and baking and wrapping and cooking, <br/>
but as I told my husband...m &amp; m can't sit around all day watching <br/>
me do these chores...she needs a diversion!)<br/>
<br/>
Well we hit two milestones today..<br/>
<br/>
we did our FIRST exchanges! We have exchanged with a few friends, <br/>
but have never run into another boxer while out. Today we met the <br/>
Maydaylillies, QueenBee and the Bookworm! <br/>
<br/>
AND<br/>
<br/>
we hit F100!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Queen Bee for going home to get her stamp and bringing <br/>
back a couple quick drive by clues for us! We didn't get to all of <br/>
them, but got enough to reach our 100! Local Heros and The Meeting <br/>
House.<br/>
<br/>
It was great meeting you all and thanks again!<br/>
<br/>
Love the O Christmas Tree series by the way! Very cute and festive!<br/>
<br/>
Ho Ho Ho to all!<br/>

As we got back to the car we saw someone in the distance walking holding clues in their hand and a backpack on so we knew it must be a letterboxers and sat there and waited.  We knew she looked formiliar but couldn't put our figure on who it was, but it was Bookworm.<br/>
