<br/>
Given recent discussions, I thought I would share a link to a site <br/>
with good, common sense internet safety information. Though directed <br/>
at parents, teens and kids, much of it makes sense for adults as <br/>
well. The link is "<a href='http://www.getnetwise.org/"' rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.getnetwise.org/"</a><br/>
<br/>
Our community has been fortunate to have had several forums for both <br/>
kids and parents on this topic. One of the best ideas I picked up <br/>
was to put the computer in the family room or wherever most people <br/>
hang out and set it up so the screen is visible to others in the <br/>
room. (Only drawback is when trying buy gifts over the internet...)<br/>
<br/>
Other guidelines we try to follow are:<br/>
 - 	Just as you stay away from strangers on the street, be <br/>
careful about strangers on the Internet.<br/>
<br/>
 - 	Never give your real last name, address, or telephone number <br/>
to anyone; if someone asks for this information (or for your <br/>
password) , don't respond. Log off and tell a trusted adult. <br/>
<br/>
 - 	Never agree to meet with someone you've talked with on the <br/>
Internet without parents with you. (For parents I guess we'd say <br/>
with a buddy).<br/>
<br/>
 - 	Don't  let people online trick you into thinking of them as <br/>
real-life friends if you've never met them in person. Just the same, <br/>
don't let people goad you into online fights (tough one!)<br/>
<br/>
 - 	If you get suspicious e-mails, files, or pictures from <br/>
someone you don't know and trust, trash them just like any other <br/>
junk mail. You could have a lot to lose by trusting someone you've <br/>
never even met. The same goes for clicking links or URLs that look <br/>
suspicious - just don't do it.<br/>
<br/>
 - 	Do not fill out any form online that asks you for any <br/>
information about yourself or my family without asking parents <br/>
first. This includes forms for contests or registering at a site. <br/>
Also check to see if the sites have a privacy policy &amp; if they <br/>
promise to keep your private information private. If they don't <br/>
promise to keep your private information private, don't give them <br/>
any private information. (Talk to your parents about what "private <br/>
information" is, such as credit card numbers.)<br/>
<br/>
Parents need to work hard to get kids to internalize these rules. <br/>
Kids are so proficient at computers they may justifiably feel that <br/>
they know more than their parents do! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this is helpful to someone!<br/>
