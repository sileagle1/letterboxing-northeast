On Sunday, the 28th, we took our friend Chris from South Burlington out letterboxing and found the Ethan Allen Homestead quietly nestled in Burlington (I expected more furniture...), then we went off to find the mystery The Graveyard, and Chris found it firstof us three!  *And* she was the First Finder!  She's probably hooked, now.  I know she is, because on the way she kept saying "Oh!  That looks like a good place for a letterbox!".  Sure symptom of mania.  Then we enjoyed the "offerings" around The Graveyard - I highly recommend this one!<br/>
    Yesterday, despite a drippy day in Rogues' Island, Diane and I went straight to the Burdick Cemetary mystery - we'd been doing our homework, you see.  Then we had lunch and gadded about to wind up at the Cross Mills Library.  Some of the nature trail signs were knocked down, but we could still figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
WARNING - Yes, the ticks are out!  I had three and Diane two!  A tick kit is definitely now a part of our backpack, along with the compass, spare inks, baggies of assorted sizes, paper napkins, and a spare box and logbook.  For role players out there, I consider it the standard adventurer's pack #2.  (Pack #1 is leaner - just your stuff: Your logbook, stamp, ink and pen/pencil).<br/>
<br/>
    Then we went to find the Signs of Life by Moonstone Baby.  We only had time for the first two, but they were teeming with signs of life!  Cows, a hawk, geese, ducks ad people.  Another warning: the directions read to go through to the SW corner of a corn field first.  The farmer has made it into half cornfield then half hay field this year.  Don't be fooled!  Just keep truckin' to the SW corner of the big open space, regardless of the crop, THEN turn north, just as she says.  Nice trails, Baby, and the stamps are really cute!<br/>
    All in all, the boxes survived the Winter well, with little wetness inside.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails,<br/>
