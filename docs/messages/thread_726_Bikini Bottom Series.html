boxes today. I want to thank everyone for their help. I actually met <br/>
Joe at the park as he was leaving after checking the boxes and he did <br/>
tell me that the compass reading for the first box was supposed to <br/>
bring you to an old pineapple juice container which held another <br/>
clue. That is why the reading was off to get to the box. He also let <br/>
me know that for the second clue, the three foot barkless section had <br/>
fallen down, and to look for the base - and to mention it in the <br/>
first boxes' logbook. Anyway, it ended up being a very successful day <br/>
as I got 15 out of 15 boxes. What a great way to spend the day! <br/>
Thanks again.<br/>
