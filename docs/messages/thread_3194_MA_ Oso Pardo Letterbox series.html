here for the Great Cape Escape.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I received misinformation. The bog owner where these<br/>
boxes were originally planted does NOT allow people to walk on his<br/>
cranberry bog. I have pullled the boxes from this location and<br/>
re-planted them in South Yarmouth, not far from the gather location.<br/>
<br/>
If you were planning to get this series, you will need to re-print the<br/>
clues!<br/>
