something to do that everyone from the grandkids to Old Uncle Ernie<br/>
can enjoy? Why not give them all a store bought stamp and a notepad<br/>
and bring them to our mini gathering? You may convert a couple!<br/>
<br/>
We finally have a date, time and meeting place! On Friday (the day<br/>
after Thanksgiving) at 10 am, the Oneida Community Mansion House in<br/>
Oneida NY has graciously offered LBNY the use of their lovely "lobby"<br/>
room for this event. If you have never been to this wonderful National<br/>
Historic Landmark, you are really in for a treat. You can read more<br/>
about the mansion in the Taphophiles, Unite! - Oneida Community<br/>
Mansion House letterbox clues.<br/>
<br/>
The Mansion House is not charging us for the use of their room for our<br/>
"exchange" gathering, which is incredible generous as they usually<br/>
charge several hundred dollars for this lovely HUGE room with<br/>
fireplace. But if you want to find the special letterboxes hidden<br/>
WITHIN the Mansion, you will have to take the tour and gather up the<br/>
clues! Adults are $5, students are $3 and kids under 12 are FREE. If<br/>
we get enough people to sign up, they will consider giving us a<br/>
special discount rate! Now you can't beat that! If we get a huge<br/>
number of people, we will run another group at the 2 pm tour.<br/>
<br/>
You can still come to the gathering and do exchanges...plus find the<br/>
letterbox that is hidden in a graveyard on the property. But I hope<br/>
you will support this wonderful facility by taking the tour. It's<br/>
absolutely fascinating and just seeing the amazing silk braided<br/>
"paintings" of Jessie Catherine Kinsley, a member of the Community, is<br/>
well worth the price of admission. They even have a special tour<br/>
designed just for kids!<br/>
<br/>
So pack up your holiday leftovers ( turkey sandwiches, anyone?) and<br/>
come join us for some exchanges and special boxes. We'll meet at the<br/>
front of the Mansion House at 9:30 am (although you can park out back<br/>
where there is a lot more room for cars) and we'll begin by taking the<br/>
tour promptly at 10 am. After the tour we'll meet up in the Lobby Room<br/>
for some exchanges, our packed box lunches and the event stamp. Door<br/>
Prizes will also be given out. EVERYONE WHO TAKES THE TOUR GETS A DOOR<br/>
PRIZE! After this you are free to roam the grounds to find the<br/>
Taphophiles Unite! letterbox, or go after the many new boxes in the area.<br/>
<br/>
Won't you come and join us and meet your local CNY boxers? There are<br/>
many new boxers in the area so this should be a lot of fun. Everyone<br/>
is welcome to attend however ....bring your visiting relatives..they<br/>
don't have to be a boxer to come take the tour and hang out with us!<br/>
Come near, come far...just don't come late! :)<br/>
<br/>
Please sign up on Atlasquest.com  by Wednesday November 15th so we<br/>
have a more accurate headcount, as they will be bringing in special<br/>
tour guides for us depending on the numbers and we might earn a<br/>
discount rate! You can still sign up after that or even show up the<br/>
day of the event, but I won't guarantee you can go on the tour, get<br/>
the special inside boxes and earn a letterboxing door prize unless you<br/>
sign up by the 15th. So please help us out by signing up as early as<br/>
possible! Thanks!<br/>
