was MIA, we verified the fact ourselves, only to find it today after a <br/>
second attempt, hidden much better than we originally did. So <br/>
the Togue is very much alive and always has been. In fact, <br/>
famous Wanda stamped in the day after the Lakes Region <br/>
gathering and left us a very nice msg since we'd just met the day <br/>
before! The Brown Knight</div>
