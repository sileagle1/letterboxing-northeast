thought I did pretty well, but after reading POE=106, I'm not so <br/>
sure. If you were at the event, but missed out on the clues, email me <br/>
a jpeg of Brian's (incredibly detailed) event stamp, and I will hook <br/>
you up. Also, the "bonus clue" is still available to those who can <br/>
translate my trail name from Latin to English...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to all organizers and contributors for a rockin' event!!<br/>
