a list of boxes we found:<br/>
<br/>
Red Bench (Box was exposed. The person who adopted the trail found <br/>
the box, but was really happy it was there. We re-hid it in the <br/>
correct spot.)<br/>
<br/>
Elephant Head (Logbook almost full...not many pages left)<br/>
<br/>
Glen Ellis Falls <br/>
<br/>
Eastern Slope Inn Riverbank Walk<br/>
<br/>
Diana's Bath (Box was cracked and contents were soaked. Unfortunetly <br/>
we couldn't do much to help since we're in Maine)<br/>
<br/>
Diana's Bath Too<br/>
<br/>
Cathedral Ledge Series<br/>
<br/>
Fall Foliage<br/>
<br/>
Rainbow Chameleon<br/>
<br/>
Strongbad<br/>
<br/>
Smooth Sailing<br/>
<br/>
Crossed Arrows<br/>
<br/>
Brownfield Bog Cattails (Box was completely filled with water. We <br/>
took it home to dry it out and will replace it very soon.)<br/>
<br/>
The boxes that don't have a comment next to them were dry and in <br/>
good condition. We had a wonderful time with all of these. <br/>

<br/>
Placed this box in July of 2003 and have not had occasion to check up<br/>
on it due to its out-of-the-way-ness. Glad to hear that it lives on.<br/>
<br/>
P&amp;I's home* series currently has 4 boxes scattered around, with more<br/>
on the way. Collect them all!<br/>
