such a great Mystery Gathering.  It was so much fun to meet with other <br/>
letterboxers &amp; "talk shop".  Thanks also to everyone there for such a <br/>
warm welcome.  Everyone was so nice and it was great to finally be able <br/>
to not only put names with faces, but to get to know people as well!<br/>

Sunshine and Swampyankee, your individual personal travelers for the <br/>
day were so touching and an honor to receive. Mayeve, I'm e-mailing <br/>
you the recipe:-) Same time, same place, next year? I'd help!<br/>

Mona for a wonderful time at the Mystery Gather.  We spent two days in <br/>
the area, and found so many wonderful stamps. We are in awe of the <br/>
carving ability! It was great fun to meet boxers we handn't met before <br/>
and to letterbox with some of them.  And we just saw that we won the <br/>
drawing for the canvas bag.  Hooray!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
