<br/>
I just spent a beautiful two days at the Chatham Bars Inn as part of<br/>
an annual off-site meeting/training.  Now, I couldn't go all the way<br/>
out there and not take advantage of some of the letterboxes in the<br/>
area, could I?<br/>
<br/>
I was restricted to how much letterboxing I could do as my days were<br/>
fairly full with all that business stuff and the nights were booked<br/>
with pre-planned social events and dinners.  (Lobster bakes and open<br/>
bars on the company or letterboxing -- hmmm... I like letterboxing,<br/>
but, well, you understand!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I did pick up a few, including a collection of hitchhikers.<br/>
<br/>
In good shape:<br/>
* Mumma &amp; Bunny Boy's Cape Cod Baseball League Series - Brewster,<br/>
Harwich and Chatham (the only three I went after)<br/>
* Sadie &amp; Russ' Cape Cod Lifesavers (great walk!)<br/>
* Mumma &amp; Bunny Boy's Pleasant Lake HH Hostel -- this hostel actually<br/>
contained three HHs:<br/>
** Cape Cod Letterboxer's Benny the Bull (taken with me)<br/>
** Tweety &amp; Mr. Coon's Ugly Froggie (also taken with me)<br/>
** Mumma &amp; Bunny Boy's Doc (left in the hostel)<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I left a HH behind in the hostel as well (I won't say which<br/>
one!)<br/>
<br/>
I also found Leader of the Pack's Reunion letterbox.  Always great to<br/>
find older boxes (this one's from 2001).  Great clues!</div>
