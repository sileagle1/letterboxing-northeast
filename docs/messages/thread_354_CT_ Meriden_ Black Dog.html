&gt;<br/>
&gt;I went in search of the first box of Black Dog today (I did #2 and #3<br/>
&gt;previously) and was happy to report that I found it doing well.  However, <br/>
&gt;in the two<br/>
&gt;and a half years that it has been in place (I believe that it was <br/>
&gt;originally<br/>
&gt;planted in 2001?), only about a half dozen people have been there!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Guys.... this hike through Hubbard Park is AWESOME!  The views are <br/>
&gt;gorgeous!<br/>
&gt;I've worked in Meriden for four years and had been to Hubbard Park numerous<br/>
&gt;times for outdoor school concerts, but never experienced the "back portion"<br/>
&gt;(reservoirs, Castle Craig etc...) until last year.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Let's get out and BOX!!!  Happy Hunting!<br/>
