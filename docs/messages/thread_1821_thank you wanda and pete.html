letterboxing on the beautiful, sunny sunday and low and behold, <br/>
wanda and pete had placed a box only five miles from my new home.  <br/>
off i went, great hike, and great view.  along the way i ran into a <br/>
hiking group of about fourteen people and made my first friends in <br/>
ny.  once again, wanda and pete placed the perfect box!  i am no <br/>
longer surprised when i see their names.  thank you.   peace amy</div>
