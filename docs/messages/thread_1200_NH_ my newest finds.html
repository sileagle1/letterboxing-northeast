Lucia's Lookout<br/>
Placed by: Morgan's Family   <br/>
Nearest city: Washington<br/>
I think this is my favorite box location so far. I had a wonderfull <br/>
challeging day getting to the box. The views were priceless and the <br/>
weather was great. The hike was the longest I have done for a while <br/>
just over 7 miles total round trip, but worth it. The box is in great <br/>
shape and at the perfect spot to have a pinic lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Time for me to disappear into the shadows again,<br/>
Untill another time,<br/>
