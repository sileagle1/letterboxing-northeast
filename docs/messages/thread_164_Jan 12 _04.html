wonderful adventure in the snow. A Grave Mystery was nice in the snow<br/>
as no one was out and about.Thanks North Star we were first finders<br/>
and Russ has the papers tucked in his pocket to prove it. !  Then on<br/>
to Bluebirds new ones A Dirt Path.  Great woods a thoughtful complete<br/>
stamp, good job~ Bluebird. We were the only ones leaving foot prints<br/>
in the forest besides the animals.  Love to go back in the spring.<br/>
Then on to the tallest Flag Pole in Killingworth.  I ran around the<br/>
pole in rememberance of Bluebirds and Lobsta Lady's dance in<br/>
Malborough as the sun was coming up one morning last winter.<br/>
Letteboxing does that to us !<br/>
Happy trails to all <br/>
