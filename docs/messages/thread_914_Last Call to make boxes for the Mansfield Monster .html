                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1224056552">This is our last call for anyone wanting to make boxes for the Mansfield Monster Mash in Mansfield, CT. We have boxes coming in from all over the U.S. You can find out all about it at  <a href="http://www.chuckstraub.com/Letterboxing/mmm.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.chuckstraub.com/Letterboxing/mmm.htm</a> This website is constantly being updated with the latest information. <br/>
If you are already signed on to make boxes and want to let me know of your progress, please do. It's a tough job keeping track of all this and any updates from the box makers is appreciated. Thanks.....Chuck and Molly<br/>
