remains of a devastating forest fire. Trees as far as the eye could see <br/>
(and beyond) were charred ruins. Luckily the third box of Jay <br/>
Drew's "Mile of Ledges" series escaped unscathed. Unfortunately all <br/>
that survived of the Paradiddle box was one ring holding the log book <br/>
pages and a lump of melted plastic in the middle of the four sister <br/>
tree. <br/>
I WILL replant...........................soon.<br/>
