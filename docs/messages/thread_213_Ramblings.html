Brian is without a computer til next week, so if you<br/>
e-mail him he probably won't get it for a while.<br/>
If you want to, you can e-mail <a href="mailto:LCONNOLLY@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LCONNOLLY@...</a><br/>
I can get messages to him. <br/>
<br/>
On the subject of event stamps, be creative and do something<br/>
clever with the stamp. Don't worry about public opinion.<br/>
Brian carved a wonderful stamp, which took him many hours<br/>
and brought it to a gathering where many people stamped the<br/>
image into their books. Later we took the stamp and hid it<br/>
as a mystery box. I am aware that one or two people found<br/>
it and were not happy that they had already had the image,<br/>
but that doesn't affect us.  There are others who have found<br/>
it that praised the clues and the location as well as the stamp.<br/>
We are proud of that box. You should be proud of your creation and<br/>
do with it as you see fit.<br/>
<br/>
And on the subject of winter boxing, we attempted to find 6 boxes<br/>
on Saturday, only to find 2. However, I'm delighted that we were <br/>
motivated to get out there and not give in to the temptation to <br/>
pull the covers over our head and hibernate all weekend. Anybody else<br/>
get out there this weekend?<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the POE gather - Warrior Women, is there going to be a place<br/>
to plug in crockpots for hot food, or should we plan to bring <br/>
something that doesn't require heating up?<br/>
