<br/>
I plan on heading to Mansfield to get some of the Monster Mash <br/>
Letterboxes.  I have begun to print out the clues, but would like to <br/>
map them out, so I can easily travel from one set of clues to the <br/>
next without backtracking, getting lost, or wasting time.  If anyone <br/>
has a printable map of Mansfield and could email it to me, that would <br/>
be great!<br/>

I don't have one that I can e-mail you but the Mansfield Centre Store near the intersection of 195 and 89 has them.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and happy boxing<br/>
