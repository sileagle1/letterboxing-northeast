We too found the Moretonhampstead Information box first, and were disappointed that the two pubs across the street had lost their boxes.  We also went to Warren House Inn afterwards, and enjoyed watching the ponies!<br/>
<br/>
We also went to Vixen Tor (the actual Vixen Tor is closed though) and Feather Tor, however, as soon as we got out there, we ran into very rainy weather and had to leave!  Glad to hear that there really are boxes on those tors!<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to read more!<br/>
