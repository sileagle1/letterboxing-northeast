as 'Man's best friend'(or Lady's)... If she is anything like <br/>
the 'Mollys' I've known she will be back on all fours quicker than you <br/>
think. <br/>

<br/>
Last spring one of our pointers had a foot issue, where I left him at <br/>
the vet for his operation, not knowing what I would come back to. <br/>
They didn't know if they had to take the toe, foot or what. His <br/>
recovery was long. He was anti-stiches ( ripped them out ) anti-<br/>
staples (pulled them out) anti... well anti everything. =) So hiking <br/>
with him last summer just didn't happen much. <br/>
<br/>
In time he was back on his feet again and ready to go. Although being <br/>
one of 3 he milked it for all it could get him. =) <br/>
<br/>
So, we wish you both the best of luck and Molly a speedy recovery. <br/>
<br/>
The kids want Molly to know that there is a great pet house show on <br/>
the DYI network and of course the animal planet is always good to <br/>
watch. As for movies they request that unless Molly wants to watch <br/>
some really scarey horror movies, that she stays away from Beetoven <br/>
the movie about the St. Benard and 101 Dalmations. My little one <br/>
acually whined at the TV durning Beetoven. =) <br/>

Take Care and best Wishes, <br/>

We haven't been doing any hiking for the past few weeks and I'm not sure<br/>
when we will be out and about again. Molly has a major problem with a toe on<br/>
her left paw. When we were out letterboxing the nail on her toe broke off<br/>
the long way and it cut into her foot. We've been back and forth to the vet<br/>
for three weeks and it just kept getting worse.  There's a bad infection and<br/>
the possibility of cancer. On Tuesday she'll be having the toe amputated.<br/>
The vet thinks that she should be ok in a few weeks but if something goes<br/>
wrong or it takes longer, that's why we're not out boxing. Molly and I are a<br/>
team and if she can't go, I don't go. So, if you're wondering where we are,<br/>
we're home and I'm watching a lot of movies with Molly lying beside me. If<br/>
everything works out, we'll be back again as soon as she's able.<br/>
