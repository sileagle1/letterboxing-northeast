                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1440503929">Over the past few years, articles about letterboxing have been <br/>
written in many local newspapers and national magazines.  There have <br/>
been articles written in the Providence Journal, Norwich Bulletin, <br/>
Hartford Courant, New London Day, Westerly Sun, Time Magazine, US <br/>
Airways' Award winning Attache magazine, and I am sure many, other <br/>
periodicals.  (Who can forget the April 1st a few years ago when <br/>
Martha Steward wanted to interview a well known letterboxer causing <br/>
such a stir on the talk group).  But none of this can compare to the <br/>
recent publication.  <br/>
<br/>
This month, the Rhode Island AAA magazine, Horizons, contains an <br/>
article about letterboxing titled "Treasure Hunting Near Home" <br/>
complete with pictures of letterboxers letterboxing.  It is a nicely <br/>
written article which basically says the same things all the other <br/>
articles said, but none the less is nice.  The thing I like most <br/>
about it is that it is under the heading of "Historic Adventure"  <br/>
which I think is pretty neat.<br/>
<br/>
Also in this month's AAA magazine, in an unrelated article <br/>
(coinsidence ?) in which our own Christopher Martin is quoted for his <br/>
interest in movies filmed in Rhode Island.  (I agree, Chris, it is <br/>
fun to spot RI places on the screen.)  People may remember there was <br/>
a Providence Journal article written not that long ago that featured <br/>
Chris &amp; Rusty Puff and Wanda &amp; Pete. <br/>
<br/>
So hats off to AAA for publishing some interesting articles.<br/>

that article. I didn't know anyone really read that publication! But<br/>
moonstone, you neglected to mention that I was quoted because I have a<br/>
website on which (among many other things) I track movie and televison<br/>
shows with a Rhode Island connection. Now I have to shamelessly plug<br/>
the site myself! :-)<br/>

PS: I wouldn't want anyone to accuse me of being completely off topic,<br/>
so let it be known that Rustypuff and I found these RI letterboxes<br/>
this weekend, in place, intact, and dry:<br/>
<br/>
NCBC<br/>
Loss of a Friend<br/>
Dolphins at Daybreak<br/>
<br/>
We did not find the Epilogue, but then, we didn't look very hard as<br/>
the sun was going down and it had previously been reported missing.<br/>
<br/>
We also checked on the Beavertail Light lb and found it in place,<br/>
intact, and dry. We took away an unnamed hitchhiker.<br/>
