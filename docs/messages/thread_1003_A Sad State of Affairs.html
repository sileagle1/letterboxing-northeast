<br/>
Over the past week, we have found 29 letterboxes and 80% of them have <br/>
either been poorly hidden or left out there in the open. This is <br/>
truly a frightening statistic. With the publication of the Time <br/>
magazine article and the new letterboxers coming into the fold, we <br/>
must all be aware of how important it is to carefully rehide <br/>
letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
It's up to ALL of us, veterans and new boxers alike, to be sure that <br/>
we leave a letterbox hidden BETTER than we found it as our way of <br/>
preserving these boxes for the future. Please tell all you know how <br/>
important this is and it's impact if we do not take as much time to <br/>
REHIDE the box as to FIND the box!<br/>
<br/>
Don't mean to preach but feel this is an important part of this game!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!! [And carefully rehide those <br/>
treasures!]<br/>

Sad to say, but the bulk of these boxes we found with problems were your<br/>
Journey into Imagination series. Great series, but the boxers ahead of<br/>
us didn't take the time to recover. Several were just left out there.<br/>
Needless to say, we left them well hidden. Thanks for a fun series to<br/>
you and all of your cohorts.<br/>
