will be at Beaver Pines Campground Saturday night. We will be boxing <br/>
in the area all day before checking in to the camp site. I'll have a <br/>
special stamp available for anyone we meet on trail or camping. Also, <br/>
a reminder that my personal event stamp will be available at the May <br/>
Day Gather. You can receive this stamp by telling me the name of the <br/>
Nipmuc indian chief killed in 1619. This stamp will be altered post <br/>
gather and planted as an ongoing box. Thanks Mommafox for the info <br/>
re: the campsite. Safe trails!<br/>
