yesterday. We went in pursuit of the two-part Sun Puzzle letterbox <br/>
in Jamaica Plain's Arnold Arboretum.<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping the dark overcast skies and chill wet weather would <br/>
discourage most folks from venturing there, so we could look for <br/>
boxes without spending a lot of time dashing away from hiding spots <br/>
and inventing involved conversations about dendrology to cover up <br/>
our true mission. :)<br/>
<br/>
We found the first Sun Puzzle box, nice hiding spot, wonderful <br/>
stamp. Could use a new outer Ziploc (Murphy's Law contributed to me <br/>
not having one on me) -- I will replace it next week when we go back.<br/>
<br/>
The second box we could not find, though we are positive we had the <br/>
right tree. There is a chance we missed it though, because the very <br/>
open and public and well-travelled nature of where it was/is hidden, <br/>
made thorough searching impossible.<br/>
<br/>
We started off after the Mad Chef letterbox, but it was too dark, so <br/>
off we went to a baklava-making party, dreaming of the box that got <br/>
away. :)</div>

Welcome to the world of 'Letterbooking'.<br/>
This reminds me that I relly should check on our library 'boxes'. With the inclement weather they get alot more traffic.<br/>
Good luck with the project.<br/>

  I am very excited! Recently, I meet with the circulation <br/>
  director for our local library and pitched a book <br/>
  letterbox (letterbook). She loved it. I worked up a stamp <br/>
  design, carved the stamp and listed the contents that I <br/>
  would supply, including wet wipes and handouts on <br/>
  letterboxing. She wrote me to say that the director signed <br/>
  off on the plan and they had decided that they would take <br/>
  a large reference book that was about to be retired and <br/>
  hollow out the pages. It already has its own Dewey code <br/>
  and we've agreed on some simple treasure hunting clues to <br/>
  find it.<br/>
<br/>
  Now I just have to wait for them to hollow out the book <br/>
  and I will post the clues. It will be in the reference <br/>

were younger being shushed by some of the ladies there :) hehe<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait, at least this one I'll be able to figure out easily :)<br/>
