                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-804245182">OK... I was up doing many of the Penwood boxes today (though I did not do the <br/>
series in question, which is Sneaky, Beaky and Leaky) and met up with two <br/>
other letterboxers who notified me that there is a wild cat's den right near the <br/>
"Leaky" box.  The cat was quite agitated and angry that people were near her <br/>
den.  (She may have had cubs in the den?)  I was asked by the other boxers I <br/>
met today NOT to do the third "Leaky" box.<br/>
<br/>
If you are planning on doing the Sneaky, Beaky and Leaky series, please be <br/>
very careful and perhaps leave the third box for another time.  I've already <br/>
e-mailed Rubaduc to notify her, and perhaps either she or I will notify the Parks <br/>
service.  Since I haven't done the series yet, and I didn't see the cat first <br/>
hand, I'm not sure if I have the authority to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, be VERY careful out there!!!!!<br/>
