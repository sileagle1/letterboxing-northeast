Celtic Roots, for a most enjoyable afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
The gather was a very low key one in which we had time to exchange and meet<br/>
many new people.<br/>
<br/>
Also fun was renewing friendships with those from years past.<br/>
<br/>
We appreciate the time spent on organizing this event.<br/>
<br/>
It was a perfect event for a February afternoon.<br/>
