friendly person.  That is why we will not be placing the boxes from  <br/>
our event there. He has requested that he be told where the  <br/>
letterboxes are.  Also, if you place a letterbox in the area where  <br/>
there is skiing in the winter - the clues have to say that the box is  <br/>
removed. He doesn't want people hiking across the skiing fields.  The  <br/>
acorn trail is not used in the winter for skiing.  My gut feeling is  <br/>
if you put too many boxes in there  the ranger will react to it.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand the town of Carlisle has a lot of conservation land  <br/>
and you can purchase their trail map at Ferns in the center of town.<br/>
