I am the Project Manager at Hop Brook Lake. Currently there are a number of <br/>
adandoned letterboxes on our project. We set up a Special Use permit with Beth <br/>
Houghtaling which expired last year and we've been trying to contact her. All <br/>
her contract info, including her email attached to her box info on this site <br/>
aren't in use. It looks like these boxes haven't been updated or maintained <br/>
since 2004. Since the Permit has expired and we can't reach Ms Houghtaling we <br/>
plan on discontinuing these boxes, unless you know of anyone or plan to adopt <br/>
them, which would require another Permit to be created to the new person that <br/>
plans to adopt these.  The boxes where placed by Mountain Girl in Middlebury CT. <br/>
The boxes that are locate in Hop Brook Lake are from the US Presidents series <br/>
#1,#2,#3, Herbert Hover, Aaron's Birthday Box and Hop Brook Lake Handicapped <br/>
Accessible. Please advise whether we can remove these from our property or if <br/>
you wish to adopt. Thank you <br/>
