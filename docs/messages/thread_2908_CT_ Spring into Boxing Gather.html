The gather was in the brand spankin' new Riverfront Community Center in Glastonbury, which is absolutely beautiful and the conference room was the perfect size for our group!  The rain pretty much stayed away for the whole day too, which allowed some of us to get out and box!<br/>
<br/>
I do have to admit.... it was nice to have the one day only boxes close to the venue, and not out on long trails.  That way, we had plenty of time to exchange and visit with other boxers.  Also, the boxes that were making their debut are permanent boxes, which is nice because we didn't feel pressured to go out and box, and we could really have fun at the gather.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks also to W.R., M.E., Donutz, Enologist and the Pepe's for the great boxes!  Lotsa Lincolns were great, as were the celtic and spring symbols that I found thus far!!!  Thanks also to MayEve for the Japanese Stab binding tutorial!  First coptic stitch, now Japanese Stab binding... I can't wait to make LOTS of logbooks!<br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone had fun!  Thanks for a great day!<br/>

What a great job this brother &amp; sister team did on this gather. Everything<br/>
was perfect. I told Sue it was great to have to spend the day inside and<br/>
talk with both new friends and old. Thanks to all who had something to do<br/>
with making this a most special day Later on tonight or tomorrow, we'll have<br/>
a little report on the gather, along with some pictures of the event on our<br/>
blog. <br/>
<br/>

Thanks again for a very special spring day! <br/>
