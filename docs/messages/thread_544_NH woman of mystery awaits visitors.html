which we planted late fall last year. Happily, the snow is no longer <br/>
obscuring the trail. No visitors so far. Thanks to our hard-working <br/>
webmasters, the New Hampshire mysteries are now easy to access <br/>
through any of the usual search routes on the website. We think a lot <br/>
of people don't know about this box. It's called The Extravagant Mme. <br/>
S.<br/>
<br/>
We think you'll find it worth the trip and the effort. There are <br/>
other letterboxes in the general vicinity (ie- not too long of a <br/>
drive) not to mention other activities in the area. We hope to see <br/>
some of your stamps in the box next time we go back.<br/>
