My cousin and I were right behind you on Friday night.  We saw your stamps in all of the vampire boxes that we found but our search was cut short by the rain and fog.  (I twisted my ankle, too).  We were hoping to run into you but I think you were long gone by the time we got there.  Anyway, we didn't find an umbrella butthat doen't mean much.  It got very dark and foggy and we were just trying to get back to the car.  I hope someone finds it for you, though!<br/>

Happy trails.....Kerri<br/>
