<br/>
In case you don't read your sales fliers - Lock and Lock boxes are on sale this week at Stop <br/>
and Shop.  I was able to snag a bunch in the Bedford, MA  S &amp; S - $2 for a 4 X 6 box.  They <br/>
havve dividers in them - but my daughter figured out you can just pull the dividers out (silly <br/>
mommy).  There where some smaller round ones there and slightly largers square ones.<br/>
<br/>
I have also found them hidden on a top shelf at Walmart - a set of 3 for $6 - but you end up <br/>
with a very large box holding the two smaller ones - but you don't have to hunt for a sale <br/>
that way.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone done a comparison of Lock and lock boxes vs. the Snap ones that are at linens <br/>
and things?<br/>
<br/>
regards,<br/>
