This Saturday, August 12, early evening, we're playing some kind of<br/>
vegetable related parade in Wakefield, RI. It's got puppets, it'll be<br/>
insane, that's all we know at this point! Starts at Wakefield<br/>
Elementary School, 101 High St. Wakefield, RI<br/>

Their website is www.providencestreetband.com<br/>

Does anyone have any boxes planted in Wakefield that they could send <br/>
me the clues to?  I don't see any boxes listed on AQ for Wakefield.  <br/>
I would really appreciate it. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

and I will be planting boxes. As in previous years, I will be posting the<br/>
clues on Friday afternoon. Since the main site is down, I will be posting<br/>
the clues here. There is a fee to get in to the fair, but it's a fun time.<br/>
Hope to see you there!<br/>

in Wakefield, before I realized that LBNE was back up.  I've wanted <br/>
to do it anyway, just had not gotten around to it.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if you know, but Wakefield and Peacedale are sort of <br/>
the same town and there are a couple of boxes in peacedale.  Also, <br/>
Narragansett is only a few miles down the road and has great <br/>
letterboxes.  <br/>
<br/>
I will also be in that area this weekend and am hoping to get a few <br/>
that I don't already have.  I will have to look into the parade.<br/>
