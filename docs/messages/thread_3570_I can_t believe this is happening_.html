the other day.  Now, I get a post from another person saying that all <br/>
three Wenches Walk boxes at Bluff Point are missing.<br/>
<br/>
I'm wondering if someone from the CT Parks department is going and <br/>
pulling our boxes?<br/>
<br/>
This is very troubling to me that our boxes are going missing....  It <br/>
seems to me that these people have the clues and are pulling the boxes.<br/>

learn that it's  missing. I can't even begin to imagine how<br/>
distressing it must be to put all that work into carving stamps,<br/>
setting up the boxes and logs, place them all, and then write the<br/>
clues, only to have them vanish. It's really sad that someone would<br/>
have such disregard for others and their property, and even sadder<br/>
that the person(s) involved may be a letterboxer.</div>
