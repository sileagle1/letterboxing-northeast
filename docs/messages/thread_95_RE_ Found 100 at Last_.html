to say the least. I've been planning to buy an orange wool hat like <br/>
my hiking brother-in-law wears.  Now, don't get me wrong..orange IS <br/>
my favorite color.  However, on my head??... when I look totally <br/>
stupid in hats as it is.  Still better silly and in less danger. Most <br/>
of the time, boxes are posted with hunting season months.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Hmm, orange is SO not my color, but just to be safe a few years ago I made myself a fairly chic orange Polartec scarf. <br/>
Nevertheless, while hearing the gunshots in Shenipsit Forest today, I kept thinking that the WHITE clue pages I was walking around <br/>
with in my hands might get mistaken for a deer's tail. What I couldn't get out of my mind was the incident, about ten years ago, when <br/>
a woman in Maine was shot and killed while in her own back yard. The deer hunter who shot her mistook her for a deer because she <br/>
was wearing white mittens.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, the clue page for the Journey Into Imagination series recommends wearing orange, but does not say during what months of <br/>
the year. It would be helpful if it specified that. I've emailed the placer to find out.<br/>
