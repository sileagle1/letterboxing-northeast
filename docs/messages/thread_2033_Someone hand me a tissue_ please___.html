<br/>
I designated this week as my MA letterbox maintenance week.<br/>
<br/>
It hasn't been a good week.<br/>
<br/>
So far, 8 of my active MA letterboxes are almost entirely destroyed.  <br/>
Could the common element be a particularly savage winter?  I so wish <br/>
that were the case.  The common element in the 8 destroyed letterboxes <br/>
was the last finders.  In all 8 cases, the last finders did not:<br/>
<br/>
1. Repack the logbook into its ziplock<br/>
2. Repack the stamp and inkpad into its ziplock<br/>
3. Put the lid back on the letterbox container<br/>
4. Rehide the letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Yes, folks, that's right.  I am now the proud parent of 8 active <br/>
letterboxes whose logbooks are soaked through from snow/rainfall, <br/>
obliterating all the signature stamps from all the previous happy <br/>
finders - but there's a bright side!  At least the now empty log pages <br/>
are brightly tinted the color of the inkpads since the last finders put <br/>
the inkpads back into the letterbox without putting the *cover* back on <br/>
the inkpads!<br/>
<br/>
At least the savvy last finders used pigment ink for their signature <br/>
stamps - these images are there clear as day.  And I should be grateful <br/>
I suppose that when these last finders were done stamping in, they <br/>
helpfully left the unsealed letterboxes quite conveniently out in the <br/>
open, on *top* of the rock/log/cairn under which the boxes were <br/>
supposed to be hidden.  Of course, these nice clear images from the <br/>
last finder had only the notation of the date.  No trail name.  <br/>
Nothing.  I can't even contact these last finders to offer to give them <br/>
well-intentioned (and I do mean that sincerely) instructions on not <br/>
only finding a box, but REHIDING a box.<br/>
<br/>
Grrrr.....<br/>
<br/>
I have repaired all of them with new logs and ink pads and ziplocks and <br/>
have rehidden them properly.  So now all Warrior Woman boxes in MA <br/>
(with the exception noted below) are back in action, ready to go.<br/>
<br/>
And now it gets worse.<br/>
<br/>
Went out to the Ashland Reservoir today to do a spring checkup on my <br/>
Valentine Series.  All three are gone.  Well, sorta gone.  I did find <br/>
some forensic evidence of their previous existence.  In the general <br/>
vicinity of one box, I found the letterbox's rubbermaid container which <br/>
had been conveniently turned into a portapotty by some enterpreneurial <br/>
partygoer.  Farther along the trail, I discovered that the logbooks had <br/>
been used for kindling for a keg party fire.  All that was left was the <br/>
wire binding and some charred bits of logbook still clinging to them.  <br/>
The last and final box, Thrill Me, I had replaced once already due to <br/>
vandalism.  Fortunately, I had replaced it as a film canister microbox <br/>
which miraculously escaped notice.<br/>
<br/>
After heaving a heavy sigh, I pocketed the "Thrill Me" microbox and <br/>
decided to turn it into a hitchhiker.  When I got home and unrolled the <br/>
scroll log, I nearly screamed.  Guess who was the last finder of this <br/>
series?  Yep - that happy crew with the pigment ink who had left all my <br/>
other boxes open and exposed.<br/>
<br/>
Rant over.<br/>
<br/>
I am officially retiring the Valentine Series in Ashland.  And I'd <br/>
advise anyone looking to plant around there to be very VERY careful <br/>
about where to hide the box.  Oh, but wait!  I guess it really doesn't <br/>
matter how well you hide the box if the last finder of your new box is <br/>
part of my happy little untraceable pigment ink crew.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry.  The rant is REALLY over now.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as I can find the heart to make another scroll log, I'll <br/>
release "Thrill Me" as a hitchhiker - after all, aren't you *thrilled* <br/>
when you find a hitchhiker in a box?!!<br/>

Apparently, hiding things is difficult for you.  If<br/>
this is the case, please leave this hobby.  You are<br/>
ruining it for everyone.  Unless, of course, you are<br/>
totally selfish and don't care about others.  Which is<br/>
what I'm leaning towards.  I'm also leaning towards<br/>
telling you what I really think.  Not only are you<br/>
disrespectful, you're idiots!!  Or should I say<br/>
"intellectually challenged"?  No....I like idiots. <br/>
Re-hiding a box is about as difficult as tying your<br/>
shoes.  Are you people named "Team Loafer"?  That<br/>
would explain the difficulty with tying shoes which<br/>
would ultimately lead to the box hiding problem. <br/>
Please stop screwing up this hobby.  <br/>
<br/>
Either learn the correct practices or go back to<br/>
sitting on your couch and eating ring dings or<br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
And stay away from my boxes, you momos!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry everyone, but this is no longer a newbie issue. <br/>
And I'm tired of letting this type of thing go. <br/>
Warrior Woman has every right to flip out, but she<br/>
didn't.  Unbelievable restraint!!  <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, restraint and my name don't often<br/>
collide in the same sentence.  Flame if you wish, but<br/>
I'm pretty sure everyone was thinking the same thing <br/>
while reading Warrior Woman's post.  If not, then I've<br/>
got some ring dings for you.<br/>

What a drag! We've also been induldging in box maintanence this <br/>
spring but luckily so far all our boxes have been very well <br/>
repackaged and rehidden. In fact, we've also recieved a TON of help <br/>
this spring from fellow boxers, who have rescued logbooks and re-<br/>
ziplocked like crazy for us. Thank you all. Even so, we've started <br/>
adding this little blurb to some of our clues:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;That thing about re-hiding again: after years of letterboxing we <br/>
are convinced that most boxes that go missing are ones that aren't <br/>
hidden well by finders. Sorry to sound harsh, but we're sure of it. <br/>
So please take a moment to re-hide these little treasures. Start with <br/>
repacking them: our boxes have two heavy duty freezer bags, and the <br/>
logbook and stamp both go inside them so that they are double-bagged. <br/>
Take the first baggie and seal in the log and stamp, then close that <br/>
whole package inside the second bag. Next, throw them into the outer <br/>
tupperware and clinch it tightly shut. Finish by re-hiding the <br/>
letterbox so that not a speck of plastic shows anywhere. It should be <br/>
completely invisible from all angles. Scatter a few leaves or twigs <br/>
on top to naturalize the spot and then it will have a good chance of <br/>
lasting until the next boxer comes looking for it. Thank you! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We stopped adding inkpads a long time ago, and we remove them from <br/>
our old boxes when they're still in there, because they make such a <br/>
mess.<br/>

  Spring has sprung, and with it comes box maintenance.<br/>
<br/>
  I designated this week as my MA letterbox maintenance week.<br/>
<br/>
  It hasn't been a good week.<br/>
<br/>
  So far, 8 of my active MA letterboxes are almost entirely destroyed.  <br/>
  Could the common element be a particularly savage winter?  I so wish <br/>
  that were the case.  The common element in the 8 destroyed letterboxes <br/>
  was the last finders.  In all 8 cases, the last finders did not:<br/>
<br/>
  1. Repack the logbook into its ziplock<br/>
  2. Repack the stamp and inkpad into its ziplock<br/>
  3. Put the lid back on the letterbox container<br/>
  4. Rehide the letterbox<br/>
<br/>
  Yes, folks, that's right.  I am now the proud parent of 8 active <br/>
  letterboxes whose logbooks are soaked through from snow/rainfall, <br/>
  obliterating all the signature stamps from all the previous happy <br/>
  finders - but there's a bright side!  At least the now empty log pages <br/>
  are brightly tinted the color of the inkpads since the last finders put <br/>
  the inkpads back into the letterbox without putting the *cover* back on <br/>
  the inkpads!<br/>
<br/>
  At least the savvy last finders used pigment ink for their signature <br/>
  stamps - these images are there clear as day.  And I should be grateful <br/>
  I suppose that when these last finders were done stamping in, they <br/>
  helpfully left the unsealed letterboxes quite conveniently out in the <br/>
  open, on *top* of the rock/log/cairn under which the boxes were <br/>
  supposed to be hidden.  Of course, these nice clear images from the <br/>
  last finder had only the notation of the date.  No trail name.  <br/>
  Nothing.  I can't even contact these last finders to offer to give them <br/>
  well-intentioned (and I do mean that sincerely) instructions on not <br/>
  only finding a box, but REHIDING a box.<br/>
<br/>
  Grrrr.....<br/>
<br/>
  I have repaired all of them with new logs and ink pads and ziplocks and <br/>
  have rehidden them properly.  So now all Warrior Woman boxes in MA <br/>
  (with the exception noted below) are back in action, ready to go.<br/>
<br/>
  And now it gets worse.<br/>
<br/>
  Went out to the Ashland Reservoir today to do a spring checkup on my <br/>
  Valentine Series.  All three are gone.  Well, sorta gone.  I did find <br/>
  some forensic evidence of their previous existence.  In the general <br/>
  vicinity of one box, I found the letterbox's rubbermaid container which <br/>
  had been conveniently turned into a portapotty by some enterpreneurial <br/>
  partygoer.  Farther along the trail, I discovered that the logbooks had <br/>
  been used for kindling for a keg party fire.  All that was left was the <br/>
  wire binding and some charred bits of logbook still clinging to them.  <br/>
  The last and final box, Thrill Me, I had replaced once already due to <br/>
  vandalism.  Fortunately, I had replaced it as a film canister microbox <br/>
  which miraculously escaped notice.<br/>
<br/>
  After heaving a heavy sigh, I pocketed the "Thrill Me" microbox and <br/>
  decided to turn it into a hitchhiker.  When I got home and unrolled the <br/>
  scroll log, I nearly screamed.  Guess who was the last finder of this <br/>
  series?  Yep - that happy crew with the pigment ink who had left all my <br/>
  other boxes open and exposed.<br/>
<br/>
  Rant over.<br/>
<br/>
  I am officially retiring the Valentine Series in Ashland.  And I'd <br/>
  advise anyone looking to plant around there to be very VERY careful <br/>
  about where to hide the box.  Oh, but wait!  I guess it really doesn't <br/>
  matter how well you hide the box if the last finder of your new box is <br/>
  part of my happy little untraceable pigment ink crew.<br/>
<br/>
  Sorry.  The rant is REALLY over now.<br/>
<br/>
  As soon as I can find the heart to make another scroll log, I'll <br/>
  release "Thrill Me" as a hitchhiker - after all, aren't you *thrilled* <br/>
  when you find a hitchhiker in a box?!!<br/>

</span></blockquote>Hi Diane,<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you 100% - if it had been only ONE box.<br/>
<br/>
But it was EIGHT boxes (you could actually call it TEN, since two got <br/>
trashed/pooped on/burned), all within the same tight geographic area, <br/>
located in three separate parks, all with the same last finder, all <br/>
dated as found the same day.<br/>
<br/>
I personally feel that their intentions were to "up" their F count by <br/>
hitting an area with a high and dense population of letterboxes, and <br/>
after stamping in just ran to the next letterbox.  These boxes were <br/>
off-trail, requiring compass work and pace counts to find them.<br/>
<br/>
But I don't want to belabor the point any longer.  I have fixed the <br/>
boxes that could be fixed, retired the series that was completely <br/>
destroyed, and took the last remaining microbox and turned it into a <br/>
hitchhiker.<br/>
<br/>
A win/win situation all around.<br/>

</span></blockquote>logbooks had <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   been used for kindling for a keg party fire.  All that was left <br/>
</span></blockquote>was the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   wire binding and some charred bits of logbook still clinging to <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   The last and final box, Thrill Me, I had replaced once already <br/>

</span></blockquote>box is <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   part of my happy little untraceable pigment ink crew.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Sorry.  The rant is REALLY over now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   As soon as I can find the heart to make another scroll log, I'll <br/>
