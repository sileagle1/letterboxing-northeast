figured them out yet. But, this weekend the Andover Historical <br/>
Society will be conducting a letterboxing event of sorts. The boxes <br/>
are going to be placed (probably not hidden very well so that its <br/>
easier) around town at historical places (The Shawsheen train depot, <br/>
Harriet Beecher Stowe's gravesite, possibly one by the William <br/>
Jenkins house) for one day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is what they have placed on their website <br/>

Jun 12 1pm-4pm   Family Road Rally        <br/>
<br/>
Explore Andover in a whole new way and join our first-ever Family <br/>
Road Rally.  Pick up the first clue and guidebook at 97 Main Street <br/>
at 1pm, and drive off with your family to discover hidden treasures <br/>
all over Andover.   <br/>
<br/>
I'm going to replace the Andover Witch for this weekend also <br/>
(probably on Friday) if anyone is interested in going to find her<br/>
