  just to let everyone know, Our Seasonal Friend is melting fast. He has been fixed up on twice since he first decided to visit. If he melts before the end of winter, the box in his memory will remain until winter is officially over. <br/>
  you all have some time left to grab this box. if you don't, you have to wait until next year when Our Seasonal Friend visits again.<br/>
