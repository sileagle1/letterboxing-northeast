<br/>
  GBGSP is Great Brook Farm State Park , Carlisle MA<br/>
<br/>
  GBFSP - selected a spot near, but not too near the first stone embraissure on the Stone Row Trail, when you start at the West end (Nothing carved).  Sadly, one of the other stone embraissures has collapsed &amp; appears to have been vandalized.<br/>
<br/>
  GBFSP - Tiny Turtle has selected a spot near the back of the Tophet Loop.  Work started on the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
  GBFSP - Fern Loop - under consideration - would actually love to see someone else place there so I could do it.<br/>
<br/>
  Greenough Land in Carlisle MA, near Billerica, Tiny Turtle has selected a spot to plant a box.  Carving not started.<br/>
<br/>
  GBFSP has a lot of boxes, but is huge, so no real problem.<br/>
<br/>
  If you are working on any of these areas, please contact me as soon as possible.<br/>
<br/>
  Thank you,<br/>
  Morgun &amp; Tiny Turtle (18 boxes planted, 1 hitchhiker = P19)<br/>
