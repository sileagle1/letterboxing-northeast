Thanks to Choi for the recommendation of where to get several of them<br/>
individually (Stampeaze).   How nice it is to have something this small!!<br/>
:-)    Was looking for something with a bit of detail work, but didn't want<br/>
to get too involved (too much risk of big screw-ups!).    I'm happy with how<br/>
it came out.  :-)  :-)    <br/>
<br/>
Next on my list:  a magnifying lamp!!!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have to finish up a few clue details and plant it tomorrow.  :-)<br/>
