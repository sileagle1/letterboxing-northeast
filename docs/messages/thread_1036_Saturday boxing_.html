one, the last of Warrior Woman's Valentine Series.  Seems as though <br/>
the "flames of passion" have burned out.<br/>
<br/>
Boxes in Framingham and Ashland all in good shape! ('cept for what I <br/>
said above)<br/>
<br/>
And, one of those boxes was in a bright red/orange tupperware <br/>
container.  Odd choice, we thought, given the color.  But we found it <br/>
intereting that our "hunting for tupperware" actually turned some up!<br/>
<br/>
These boxes will be listed on our website tomorrow <br/>
(home.comcast.net/~scott.e.hall/letterbox.html) although with so <br/>
many, the descriptions and pictures may take longer.<br/>
<br/>
We're up to 34 finds now ... not bad for a month or so of hunting!<br/>
