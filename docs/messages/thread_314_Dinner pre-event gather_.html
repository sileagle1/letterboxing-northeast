Some talk was circulating about a pre-event dinner get-together before<br/>
the Maine Gathering?? This sounds great.<br/>
<br/>
How many folks are interested in this? If we get at least 10 or more<br/>
folks, we can settle on a place and make some plans soon. Personally<br/>
I'd prefer Portland area establishments, but as that is quite a 1/2hr<br/>
drive out of the way - I think Biddeford/Wells/Kennebunk/Saco area is<br/>
more reasonable.<br/>
<br/>
Nautilus- I'm thinking Governor's in Biddeford, or perhaps TJ's PIzza<br/>
in Biddeford as most folks seem to be staying in that area. Otherwise<br/>
there is the Weathervane restaurant in Sanford with good seafood and<br/>
my personal favorite Federal Jacks (home of Shipyard BrewHouse) in<br/>
Kennebunk...The latter gets my vote, but might require designated<br/>
driving afterwards ;-)</div>

<br/>
When I started this dinner thing, I never meant to add to your <br/>
workload! You two probably have enough to do. I called it a "pre-<br/>
gathering" dinner only for lack of another word - never meaning a <br/>
gathering sanctioned event! It all started out as an informal event - <br/>
but as you both know, gathering fever is contagious!<br/>
<br/>
There are 10 of us already willing and able to go to dinner - all of <br/>
us staying at the Comfort Suites in Biddeford - 2 Exits up from the <br/>
event!! ;)<br/>
<br/>
So far, we are: TeamGreenDragon, Solar &amp; Binx, RustyPuff &amp; CSCM, <br/>
Amymisha &amp; CameraObscura and Sue and myself. Does that sound like a <br/>
party or what? Think we'll be talkin' about the Red Sox's chances at <br/>
the pennant this year? <br/>
<br/>
Again, don't feel you both have to go crazy making arrangements. Some <br/>
or most of us are planning on letterboxing our way up from the Boston <br/>
area Saturday morning and are not quite sure where we may end up. I <br/>
would suggest the Biddeford/Saco area also for dinner so that we can <br/>
check into our hotel, clean up and have time to make the dinner - but <br/>
not so early as to cut into our boxing time!!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!! [And meet us for dinner <br/>
wherever!]<br/>
<br/>

decide. Of course one of my favorite restaurants in Biddeford is that <br/>
Indian food place - Jewel of India I think it's called - though I think <br/>
Federal Jack's has a bit more variety for folks to choose from. Portland <br/>
does have much more to choose from, but is a bit further. Litchfields in <br/>
Wells is also pretty good.<br/>
