<br/>
We also had a wonderful time this weekend!!  We were having so much <br/>
fun that we were the last to leave so, we found a few things that <br/>
someone might be missing.<br/>
<br/>
First, we found a small Winnie-the-Pooh rattle that must belong to <br/>
one of the little ones with Tali and Emily.  We would be more than <br/>
happy to send it home so, if anyone knows how to reach them directly <br/>
please let them know we have it.<br/>
<br/>
Second, we found a small black umbrella that we thank the owner for <br/>
leaving because it came in handy boxing in the rain on Sunday.  We <br/>
would of course be happy to return it to the rightful owner.<br/>
<br/>
We also found a varied collection of bug sprays if anyone wants to <br/>
claim them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to Alan and all the great letterboxers that attended.  <br/>
It was a weekend to remember!!<br/>
