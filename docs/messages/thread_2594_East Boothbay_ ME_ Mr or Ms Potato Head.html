the box everyone keeps missing, it should be findable now. I couldn't <br/>
check on the other boxes, as when we started off down the trail there <br/>
were hunters ahead. I prefer not to be shot in the head whilst boxing <br/>
and a death by deer mistaken-ness on Thanksgiving Day and Misha's <br/>
birthday would be rather tragic. They have done a lot of trail work on <br/>
these trails, so the clues will have to be reworked. I will do them <br/>
after huntin' season is over.<br/>
