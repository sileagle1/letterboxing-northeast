<br/>
If you have access to a photocopier, you could make a copy of your <br/>
printed image, and use the photocopy as exhibit A for the ironing <br/>
process. <br/>
<br/>
Ironing is really the way to go, though, since you get a super sharp <br/>
image without any mess or residual brain damage from inhaling fumes <br/>
from &lt;insert solvent of choice&gt;. <br/>
<br/>
One caveat, even with a toner based image, ironing does not seem to <br/>
work on certain carving blocks, most notably the crumbly cream <br/>
colored stuff. No matter, just use Mastercarve or the pink stuff and <br/>
life will be good.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and don't let the iron get too hot or linger too long, or the <br/>
carving block can undo itself and end up half stuck to the paper. <br/>
That can really detract from your overall carving experience.<br/>

I don't do this all of the time, since it requires me to print it off of the computer, then head down to the corner Pharmacy where they have an older copier, then make a copy of it.  I've found that a medium hot iron with a tad of steam works very well!<br/>

copying machine.  THe nail polish remover method sounds way to messy <br/>
for me.  I tried ironing once but used the output from my laser <br/>
printer which hardened and could not be carved.  I use PZ Kut for my <br/>
carving material.  I will start my search for an old copying machine.<br/>
