                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-823704586">I just had a frantic search to find my first log book.  I was looking<br/>
for info on a box I had found in 2006.  Much to my surprise, that<br/>
first log book not only has my finds from when my family started<br/>
boxing in 2005, but on the very first page I have my first finds from<br/>
2001!!<br/>
<br/>
In 2001 I learned about boxing and took my best friend on a surprise<br/>
trip.  I told her to bring a stamp and a book.<br/>
<br/>
We found 3 boxes that first day.<br/>
Bay of Bristol #1 and #2 in Bristol, RI<br/>
Fort Butt in Portsmouth, RI<br/>
<br/>
After that I went boxing with my husband 9 days later finding <br/>
Island Sanctuary in Jamestown, RI<br/>
<br/>
Then life took over and boxing got put aside until Nov 2005.  My son<br/>
was then 3 and we started boxing in earnest.  <br/>
<br/>
I was so excited about finding my original log book that I just had to<br/>
share!<br/>
