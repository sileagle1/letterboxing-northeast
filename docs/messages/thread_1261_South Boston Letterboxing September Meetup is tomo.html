maybe they were just testing it?  But if it was real, the difference <br/>
between "tomorrow" and a message sent 15min before the meetup <br/>
scheduled time is disappointing.  It will be interesting to hear if <br/>
anyone actually did go.<br/>

all been too far away or on impossible weekends.  The Monster Mash <br/>
will be our first gathering.<br/>
