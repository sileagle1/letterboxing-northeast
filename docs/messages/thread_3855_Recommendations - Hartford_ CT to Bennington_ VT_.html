<br/>
Martini Man and I will be in a portion of the NE area from AUG 9 - 17.  <br/>
We'll be flying in/out of Harford, CT and looping up into the <br/>
Bennington, VT area. So we'll be in northwest CT, western MA and <br/>
southwest Vermont, and may possibly cross over into NY. We're hoping to <br/>
get recommendations for some good hikes that include letterboxes.  The <br/>
main focus of our trip will be hiking &amp; letterboxing, so longer treks <br/>
are welcome!  We haven't set an exact route yet, but will let the <br/>
hiking opportunities guide us in selecting where we might want to make <br/>
hotel reservations.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can also provide info on any of your favorite restaurants in <br/>
this general area, we'd love to hear about them.  If by any chance any <br/>
of you live in this area, let us know if you'd like to meet up to <br/>
hike/box with us or get together for a meal.<br/>
