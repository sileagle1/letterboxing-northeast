                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1861654913">Wow!  Anjabanja and I have only been to one other gathering since <br/>
our start of letterbox in late June (we list 3 on our site due to <br/>
the Cat and the Canary traveling event stamp), but all we can say <br/>
about MMM is ... WOW!<br/>
<br/>
We're not really huge on the whole exchange thing, although we very <br/>
much like to meet and chat with other letterboxers, so despite the <br/>
very large number of letterboxers there, we picked up only 31 <br/>
exchanges between the two of us.<br/>
<br/>
However, we enjoyed meeting every one and well as a number of <br/>
letterboxers whom we did not officially exchange with. Special <br/>
hellos to Northstar and Scarab!  It was also nice to reconnect with <br/>
some of the letterboxers we've met previously, especially Team Green <br/>
Dragon and The Dream Catchers.<br/>
<br/>
We were hoping that we'd hit 100 finds over the weekend.  We came <br/>
into Mansfield with 82 finds (78 boxes and 4 PTs).  Well, I have <br/>
finally finished our tally and we are amazed that we added some 59 <br/>
boxes (including 2 permanent boxes and 1 HH) and 2 PTs bringing my F <br/>
count to a whopping 142 and Anjabanja's to 141!  Our very first <br/>
letterbox find was June 19 ... only 15 weeks ago.  We were averaging <br/>
between 5 and 6 boxes per week up to now ... and now are averaging <br/>
over 1 box found per day!  Of course, these kinds of statistics <br/>
don't really mean all that much when you compare the very close <br/>
proximity of boxes in Mansfield, and how the MMM boxes were placed <br/>
compared to, say, the boxes we hunted in NH's White Mountains.  <br/>
Regardless, we're excited to see our F-count jump and have now set <br/>
our sights on 250 as our next big target.<br/>
<br/>
As I'm rambling on, let me stop to thank anybody who was involved in <br/>
the organization or operation of this event ... most specifically <br/>
the host, Chuck &amp; Molly.  We didn't have any real time to talk with <br/>
Chuck, but we pass along our gratitude anyway!<br/>
<br/>
We started our quest Friday night around 6pm and hunted two boxes <br/>
that night ... we ran into a couple of other letterboxers, stumbled <br/>
upon a permanent box, and looked forward to Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
We found 10 boxes before the meeting, got a couple of PTs at the <br/>
gathering, and hit our 100 mark with "Carrie", whom we hunted with <br/>
Warrior Woman.  34 boxes and 2 PTs later, we called it a night.  <br/>
Although we've rountinely hunted boxes right up until dusk, this <br/>
night we met up with Scarab and a group from D.C. and hunted well <br/>
into the darkness -- picking up the boxes in the Munsters series and <br/>
the Bad Knees series as a result.  Before we headed back to camp, <br/>
however, Anjabanja and I trekked near the old cemetery in the pitch <br/>
dark to pick up two more -- Attack of the 50 Foot Woman and Mummy <br/>
Dearest.  That was rather a spooky adventure indeed!<br/>
<br/>
We had an early start Sunday and nabbed 25 boxes before heading back <br/>
home.  The biggest adventure this day was hunting the Dawnlanders <br/>
box and having to cross the river with the aid of a staff generously <br/>
left by another hiker or letterboxer.  Somebody ought to build a <br/>
bridge ... my right foot is still wet!<br/>
<br/>
We're hoping to come back to pick up more of the temporary boxes <br/>
this month and will be back in the spring or summer 2005 to start <br/>
hunting some of the hundreds of permanent boxes in the town as <br/>
well.  Anjabanja's eager to show me around UConn, her alma mater, as <br/>
well (we didn't allow much time for anything other than letterboxing <br/>
this weekend).<br/>
<br/>
It's gonna be some time before we get our journal-web site up to <br/>
date for all those boxes, but we're working on it.  If you're <br/>
interested, you can see our stories and pictures at <br/>
home.comcast.net/~scott.e.hall/.  I'm hoping to at least have the <br/>
list updated and attach pictures by tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, time to stop rambling!  Looking forward to the next <br/>
gathering which is not too far away (if you know the details!).<br/>

No problem!  I can't wait to get the box back and see all the people <br/>

&gt; Oops ... sorry.  I originally flipped through my log counting the <br/>
&gt; stamps to see which was 100 ... and erroneously counted the Great <br/>
&gt; Pumpkin LB as three stamps instead of one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unforunately, that makes Godzilla by S. Pike and Lohr Angeles our <br/>
&gt; 100th box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Regardless, we'll remember Carrie as the "box that almost was <br/>
100th".<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Will that work?  :-)  You know, with so many boxes found in one <br/>
&gt; weekend, it really is hard to keep track!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry ...<br/>

&gt; We have another milestone for your excellent Carrie<br/>
&gt; letterbox.  When we went out on Sunday to find her, we<br/>
&gt; all walked over to the pile of rocks that she was<br/>
&gt; hiding in.  The fun part was that our little spider<br/>
&gt; Eric moved the correct rock and pulled out the box. <br/>
&gt; This making it his first real find!!!  We being giddy<br/>
&gt; letterboxing parents took a photo record of the event.<br/>
&gt;  Now, we just need to start teaching him to rehide<br/>
&gt; well. ;-)<br/>
