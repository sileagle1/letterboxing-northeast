hiking the AT near Salisbury Ct. He was taken to Sharon hosp. and <br/>
apparently needed to be airlifted to Hartford Hosp. Lets be careful <br/>
out there! REminds me that I want to get Ryan's "Giant's Thumb" LB! :)<br/>

</span></blockquote>Gosh, I hope he wasn't looking for my letterbox when that happened!  <br/>
That would definitely deserve the Purple Heart Award for Courage in <br/>
Letterboxing!  He wasn't a thru-hiker, was he?<br/>
<br/>
I don't think anybody has ever found that box yet--at least none <br/>
that I know of.  Still waiting for a first-finder!  And in <br/>
Connecticut, no less.  *shaking head*  Just shameful.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
I didn't see a single snake when I hiked through Connecticut.  Just <br/>
rain--every single friggin' day.  Oh, that awful weather!<br/>

Syt-u-ation has all new log books . I am enjoying reading all the messages that <br/>
folks left over the years.  Thank you .<br/>
<br/>
The Meadow Flowers are all alive and blooming even in the cool weather !  The <br/>
clues have been changed for BULL THISTLE  as I moved the box to a better place <br/>
and hope you will enjoy finding it now . <br/>
<br/>
Right now ,November 2011 ,  the Beavers are so active and they have caused <br/>
flooding of part of the trail which makes it fun to find a way over the little <br/>
stream they have created .  There are several benches to sit and be quiet - you <br/>
might see a beaver !  but surely will see birds .  Enjoy  one of our favorite <br/>
places . <br/>
