                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1478159511">So there we were, in the Black Forest, climbing this huge 'hill' <br/>
above the old town of Freiburg.  Of course, we are going after a <br/>
letterbox knowing darned well that our compass is sitting in a <br/>
backpack in our dining room in Rhode Island.  Dang.<br/>
<br/>
We get up the hill, and we're higher than the highest cathedral <br/>
steeple in the city.  Then we need to climb up this 100-foot steel <br/>
tower swaying in the high winds.  Why?  Because there's clues up <br/>
there!<br/>
<br/>
After we get the clues, we trek along the ridgeline, through the <br/>
ruins of old fortifications.  Truly neat.  We count out the <br/>
appropriate paces and count milestones and approximate degrees and <br/>
such based on the Sun and that every traditional European cathedral <br/>
is laid out east-west.  So guess what?  We found the box!  Hoorah!<br/>
<br/>
Our first Old World box!  We're so proud.  So two weeks in Germany <br/>
and Austria, only one find, and we're so happy about it?  Well I tell <br/>
you - Nybbler put this box out (a very nice one!), and it was one of <br/>
the shortest walks there was of all the clues for Germany.  And this <br/>
was something of a shlep, but also soooo much of the other areas were <br/>
snow-covered.<br/>
