                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1606714055">For those interested in finding the boxes at the Brownstone Festival next Saturday...clues will be available at the information tables in town...one will be on the Town Green behind the police station....which is on Main Street.<br/>
<br/>
The other information table will be down at the actual quarry...read the clues to Cozy Cavies HH Hostel to find the quarries. Unfortunately it will probably be too busy at the quarry to get this box...perhaps I'll pull it and just have you ask for it at the information table...keep your eyes open. <br/>
<br/>
If coming for the first time...print out clues for Big Pine in Portland too...it is in the same park. I have about 3 or 4 new boxes in mind for the day...still have to carve and put them together though! <br/>
<br/>
My Portland Hometown PLB has disappeared in the mail, which makes me very sad, so I may re-carve the stamp and hide it as well. <br/>
<br/>
Any questions? Drop me a note!<br/>
