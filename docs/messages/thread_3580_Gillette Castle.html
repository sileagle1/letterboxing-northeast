OK, I know DEP isn't pulling Gilette Castle Park's boxes.  Those are within <br/>
my supervisor's jurisdiction, and he doesn't mind letterboxes in his parks at <br/>
all.  I got that straight from him today.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to GIlette Castle tomorrow to see what's there and what's not <br/>
tomorrow after work.  Anyone who wants to join me is welcome to.  Email me.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who wants me to pull some boxes for them this week for safe-keeping <br/>
while I'm on summer vacation (have no concrete plans for any day this week but <br/>
Friday) can email me...  I'm trustworthy!  :)  (Ask just about anyone on this <br/>
list...  I come with references!)  I promise to hold onto it all safely until <br/>
this whole thing blows over, but I won't do any pulling without being asked by <br/>
the placer(s).  (Wouldn't that make me just as bad???)<br/>
