and had a fantastic time!  My kids had a great time playing with all <br/>
of your kids and any worries I had prior to attending went right out <br/>
the window!  Thanks to Chuck, Molly and Chickabirdie, as well as ALL <br/>
of the Monster Mash volunteers!  I met so many wonderful people!  I <br/>
look forward to seeing you on the trails and at another gathering!  <br/>
Thanks to Warrior Woman, Sojourner and so many others for making me <br/>
feel so welcome!  Have a fun day of boxing today!  I'll be out on the <br/>
trails later in the month.<br/>
