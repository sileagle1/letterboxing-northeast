boxes I found and did not find. All the found boxes were in fine <br/>
shape, even though some were quite exposed. All were recovered better <br/>
when we left. Here is the list:<br/>
<br/>
CCBL West Box #4 Falmouth Commodors<br/>
Woods Hole<br/>
CCBL West Box #2 Cotuit Kettleers<br/>
The Empty Tomb (Very creepy!!)<br/>
Flaming Dragons<br/>
Old Iron Sides (Mermaid Mom - thanks for being so understanding)<br/>
Bray Farm Letterbox<br/>
Toy Box #4: Scrabble<br/>
Bass Hole Letterbox<br/>
Unless Letterbox<br/>
Le Pew Lebberbox<br/>
Shade Tail Letterbox<br/>
Indian Grounds<br/>
AJ's Box<br/>
<br/>
Could not find:<br/>
<br/>
The Sandy Neck Sand Dollar - I believe we were in the right spot, but <br/>
we could not find more than two trees heading towards the water from <br/>
the garbage can, and did not find the box near either one. Anyone <br/>
else have problems with this one over the 4th?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who planted these wonderful boxes for us to find. It <br/>
was wonderful having so many to choose from. I decided on very short <br/>
ones and drive-bys since I was with my daughter Callie, and she is <br/>
not a good walker. Good thing, since she twisted her ankle on the <br/>
very first box and hobbled the rest of the day!<br/>
