<br/>
We used to lb in CT and MA but moved to NJ in May 2006 after we <br/>
graduated college.<br/>
<br/>
We were getting so excited because our little sketch book was almost <br/>
full, we had a stamp on every page except the last 10.<br/>
<br/>
Well wouldn't you know that we went out to LB in the New Jersey Pine <br/>
Barrens and got our Geo Prism (I know.. not an off-roading vehicle) <br/>
stuck in a large puddle in the sandy roads on our way back home from <br/>
a box. It was a pretty funny situation until we relized the car was <br/>
filling up with water on the passenger side. Then I came to a <br/>
hearbreaking relaization: my letterbox page was on the floor on the <br/>
passenger side - and my stamp book was sitting in water!<br/>
<br/>
We lost a lot of our first images.. about 20 of them. We plan on <br/>
coming back up to CT and trying to re-find some of them for new <br/>
images. we carefully removed all the pages, dried them and glued them <br/>
into a new book... some of the images are just blurs, but a lot of <br/>
them escaped relativly unharmed.<br/>
<br/>
So heres why we are posting.. our two favorite images in the whole <br/>
book (ya know the one we have to show anyone whenever they look at <br/>
our book... "oh oh! you have to see this one!") are absolutly <br/>
ruined.. and they were event stamps so we can't go back out and find <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Does any one know who has the Ice Cream Gather 2005 Event stamp (i <br/>
think.. i remember we were in Carlisle, MA) stamp and the Death by <br/>
Chocolate stamp? We would would be so appreciative if whoever did <br/>
could stamp it on an index card and send us a replacement image. <br/>
Those are the two stamps that we loved the most in our whole book.. <br/>
otherwise we wouldn't be asking.<br/>
<br/>
We appreciate any help any one can give us!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Both of these stamps were carved by Team Randalstik. He isn't very active  in <br/>
the hobby anymore but I do believe he may still monitor this board. I don't  <br/>
believe either of these two stamps have been replanted.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't hear from him in a little while, contact me off list and I may  <br/>
be able to get in touch with him (a friend of a friend).<br/>

Just a tip, but if you do all your stamping next time with pigment-based  inks, you won't lose your images and will be able to dry the pages and save most everyrhing if the pages become wet. Yes, yes, pigment ink takes slightly longer to dry but just slip a papertowel or other blotting sheet on top of the last stamp and the next page and you will be just fine.<br/>

a tip when we were beginning the hobby. It was the stamp images from <br/>
before that point that were ruined..<br/>
<br/>
So I second that advice, to anyone out there who doesnt, USE PIGMENT <br/>
INK.. it did save most of our images.<br/>
