You folks were the last finders of my 7 box Blade Runner Series in <br/>
Westerly, RI.  You found them on December 31, 2005.  You put the <br/>
boxes back together and re-hid them so well that three months later, <br/>
after a New England winter, they were still dry and intact and <br/>
*still* completely well hidden!<br/>

I found four out of five of my Let's Fly Away boxes totally uncovered and very vulnerable.  I'm glad I pulled them when I did.<br/>

It seems whenever we find a poorly returned box, the last stamper is a  first <br/>
timer and/or someone we've never heard of and not listed on the website.  <br/>
Coincidentally, they always seem to have a store-bought stamp! Figures. . .  <br/>
they're not in it for the long haul.  <br/>
