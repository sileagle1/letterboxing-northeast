letterbox-usa group.  I wanted to post parts of it here as the boxes <br/>
I'm hoping to place are all in the Northeast.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey all!<br/>
<br/>
Although I'm new to this hobby and quite eager to get out there and <br/>
find more letterboxes, I'm itching to place a few as well.  As I <br/>
alluded to on another thread, the challenge I see is the area near my <br/>
home is fairly saturated with letterboxes and as I try to think of <br/>
unique an interesting places to plant, many of my ideas are of places <br/>
that are at least a couple of hours from home.<br/>
<br/>
The challenge with placing boxes outside of a certain radius is that <br/>
they become very hard to care for.  Although I'm enthusiastic about <br/>
letterboxing, I'm not as willing to spend all of my free time <br/>
revisiting every place I put a letterbox to make sure it's still in <br/>
great condition and hasn't gone missing.<br/>
<br/>
From what I've read around here it seems that people vary in how much <br/>
and how often they care for their boxes.  Some are quite dilligent <br/>
about it, others more lax.  Some have placed boxes only near their <br/>
hoome, others have placed boxes while on vacation -- knowing full <br/>
well that they cannot maintain them and may never see them again.<br/>
<br/>
[CONTENT REMOVED -- see letterbox-usa]<br/>
<br/>
My next point concerns adoption of boxes.  For those boxes that I'm <br/>
hoping to plant that are outside of an area I can reasonably <br/>
maintain, I was thinking that I could plant and then effectively <br/>
orphan the box immediately.  As long as people reported the box <br/>
as "alive and well", I'd have no worries.  Because 'boxers routinely <br/>
carry extra zip-log bags, etc. I'd be reasonably comfortable that the <br/>
integrity of the box could be maintained.  An issue would only arise <br/>
if some of the boxes contents (notably the stamp and logbook) were <br/>
damaged or missing, if the logbook was full, or if the box itself <br/>
disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
To handle these situations I thought I might recruit a caretaker.  <br/>
Not necessarily the same as an "adopter", the boxes would still be <br/>
mine I would bear the trouble of maintaining them.  The caretaker <br/>
would be a person who, when requested, would visit the box to confirm <br/>
a report of damaged contents, missing box, etc.  I would then work <br/>
with the caretaker to correct the problem or decide to retire the <br/>
box.  If the opportunity arose to visit the box again, I would.<br/>
<br/>
Box reports would still filter to me.  If the box's logbook was full, <br/>
for example, a finder would report that to me, I'd get in touch with <br/>
the caretaker and ask them to replace the logbook with another and <br/>
ship the full logbook to me.  I'd then pay for the cost of the new <br/>
logbook and shipping of the old one.<br/>
<br/>
As I place letterboxes outside my home area I'd develop essentially a <br/>
team of caretakers helping me maintain my placed boxes that are too <br/>
difficult for me to keep up on my own.<br/>
<br/>
As for hooking up caretakers with my boxes, I'd request anyone <br/>
willing to help out to first find the box using only my clues.  They <br/>
could then count the box as a find and would know its exact location <br/>
if it needed maintenance.  If they were willing to visit the box from <br/>
time to time just to check on it (like adoption) that would be great, <br/>
but not necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Does this idea sound plausible?  I won't yet divulge the areas I'm <br/>
planning on planting boxes.  I was thinking I would recruit a <br/>
caretaker(s) as I prepare to plant a box outside my home area or <br/>
shortly after the box has been planted.  I have a list of potential <br/>
boxes I'm hoping to create ... 5 individual boxes and 1 6-box <br/>
series.  Only 3 of these 11 boxes would be in my home area, and even <br/>
one of those might be difficult to consistently maintain.  I also <br/>
have an idea for a large 11-box driving tour series that I'd place in <br/>
an area outside my home region.<br/>
<br/>
In summary:<br/>
1.  [ONLY POSTED ON LETTERBOX-USA]<br/>
2.  Do you think my "caretaker" idea is a good one?<br/>
<br/>
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS SPECIFIC TO LbNE:<br/>
I should mention that from an earlier thread a couple of people have <br/>
already mentioned they would adopt boxes I placed close to them, but <br/>
as my message above speaks to, I'm trying to either modify what <br/>
adoption means or develop an entirely new concept called "caretaking".<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts are appreciated!<br/>

I am happy to hear of your interest in boxing. I'm also very happy to hear that somebody is <br/>
forward thinking about the population of boxes in proximity to other boxes. That brings <br/>
up an important point that we should consider. In sensitive wildlife spots and trails, there <br/>
should be some consideration given to the number of boxes in a given area.  Though I <br/>
love connecticut for it's abundance of boxes, i also treasure the state of Maine and the fact <br/>
that the boxes are few and far between.  This makes them special and unique and yes, <br/>
hard to come by.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for bringing this thought to the talk list. I hope that with informed people who <br/>
are also thoughtful of the natural surroundings we also have good letterbox placement.  <br/>
sometimes I think people are afraid to say that somebody might have a box in a really bad <br/>
area. I think i was called on this more than once, thank you to Giddy. I really didn't think <br/>
carefully about the Saco Heath and lo and behold, it needed to be moved ....and for the <br/>
better! <br/>
<br/>
As a "placer" I really appreciate feedback like this from people who are out there finding <br/>
boxes. If you think that somebody has a box in an area that is way far off the trail or even <br/>
dangerous, you should by all means call them on it. Thank you for bringing this up!<br/>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>"Adoption" can mean as much or as little as you want, and be decided by you <br/>
and whoever offers to help on a box-by-box basis. I've adopted boxes <br/>
planted in the Finger Lakes after the original owner moved out of state, <br/>
but the boxes remain in his name, the logbooks still carry his email <br/>
address and box reports still go directly to him. I just check up on his <br/>
boxes every now and then to make sure they're in good shape. I send him a <br/>
little update whenever I check in on them, he lets me know if they need <br/>
special attention based on a finder's report, and that works well for us.<br/>
<br/>
I've also adopted local boxes by people who have moved away, were never <br/>
local in the first place or have lost interest in LBing altogether. These <br/>
boxes are listed under my name on the LBNA site, the clues link to my own <br/>
page, box reports come to me but I still list the original owners as <br/>
creators and haven't changed one word of their clues. I *am* itching to <br/>
change one word in one box's clues since the way it's written now leads to <br/>
lost of needless (IMO) time searching in the wrong area. But the planter <br/>
already knew it led to confusion and didn't want to adjust the clue, so I <br/>
respect her wishes even though she's no longer maintaining the box.<br/>
<br/>
Just let people know up front how you want to handle <br/>
adoption/caretaking/whatever you choose to call it. I can't imagine that <br/>
anyone who's willing to help in the first place would have any problem with <br/>
your preferences.<br/>

only so big...)<br/>
<br/>
