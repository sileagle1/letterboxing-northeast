We're glad you found us! One of the benefits that<br/>
I like best about this group is that Brian and I<br/>
know *almost* everyone here personally and I think<br/>
most everyone else knows everyone else. The gather<br/>
in Westboro sounds like it will have a pretty <br/>
good attendance and we are looking forward to seeing<br/>
all our friends, old and new, again!<br/>
