forest learning shelteer and for insurance reasons they want it closed <br/>
while the building is going in. There are other ways to get to it, but <br/>
it would have meant a longer walk. Hope you enjoyed your trip to our <br/>

P.S. If you're ever come back to do Otter in the Pines, check the <br/>
mystery boxes as well- it'll be worth your while :)<br/>

</span></blockquote>I concur on this statement Laura! Not nearly enough folks that are<br/>
from away check the status or even attempt the mystery boxes in Maine.<br/>
They're not all that difficult, and yes, it might require some<br/>
sleuthing, but they are usually worth it. I know of many boxes that<br/>
contain cuckoo clues and bonus clues to other boxes and/or series. <br/>
<br/>
If there is one thing I'd suggest for folks planning a trip, don't<br/>
omit those mystery boxes :)<br/>

</span></blockquote>I love to do mystery boxes but when you are not local to the area a<br/>
small mystery often becomes a huge one!  I've planted a couple myself<br/>
that were not difficult for locals but for folks from out of<br/>
state/province they were very diffcult.  I've looked at a few of the<br/>
Maine mystery boxes and hope to try a few next week when I visit - if<br/>
I have time to do all the research needed before we hit the road! <br/>
When your holiday time is limited one tends to pick the boxes you<br/>
think you can successfully find in the time you have available, print<br/>
those clues out and take them along with you.  Sometimes I travel with<br/>
my laptop, sometimes not.  But if I haven't solved the mystery - at<br/>
least the starting location - before we leave home - I will definitely<br/>
not be able to find the box.  I have decided to have all of my future<br/>
mystery boxes include a identified starting point or a very very easy<br/>
clue to the start.  After that the clues can be more cryptic and for<br/>
everyone, local and visiting, it's pretty much a level playing field.<br/>
Not sure if this still counts as a mystery box but the mystery can be<br/>
any part of the clue/s I think...?<br/>

last week.  At Laudholm Farms, we needed two boxs, one of which was<br/>
Otter in the Pines.  When we saw that the trail was posted as closed,<br/>
we were disappointed at first.  A tractor operator happened to be<br/>
driving into the construction site (which is the reason the trail is<br/>
closed) and said he didn't mind if we walked the trail.  And so we<br/>
did, sucessfully finding the box.  We also noticed by studying the<br/>
trail map that the box could be reached by another route.  In fact we<br/>
returned using the alternate way. <br/>
<br/>
Other boxes we visited include:<br/>
Fiddlehead<br/>
The Hound - Sherlock Holmes #2<br/>
Cooks Brook<br/>
Mourning Dove<br/>
Box of Rocks<br/>
Togue<br/>
Picket Fence<br/>
Snow Falls Snowflake<br/>
Porcupine Den<br/>
Transportation HH Hostel<br/>
Majestic Moose<br/>
Harbor Lights<br/>
Keep in Touch 1,2 &amp;3<br/>
Waddle We Do Without You<br/>
EPSF<br/>
Clean Water for All<br/>
And Justice for All<br/>
First Do No Harm<br/>
<br/>
We returned home and found that paplela had put out several more<br/>
boxes in the York area which we had not seen before we left.  What a<br/>
busy placer she is!  <br/>
<br/>
Hitch hikers encountered:<br/>
Golden Slipper in Worldwide ME - Athens<br/>
Itty Bitty Tear in The Hound in Saco<br/>
M.S. Escher at the HH Hostel in Wells<br/>
New Jersey - handed to me by CT TrAAveler<br/>
<br/>
Did not find:<br/>
The Way Life Should Be in Kittery.  Pretty sure we were in the right<br/>
place, however.<br/>
<br/>
We also found time to play in the ocean at York Beach where the water<br/>
was almost WARM two days in a row and enjoy a family picnic.<br/>
<br/>
Now it is back to the scheduled life.<br/>

Otter in the Pines<br/>
<br/>
We were led to the Otter by a nice gentleman who knew what we were <br/>
looking for.<br/>
<br/>
I could kick myself.  I was at the Seashore Trolley Museum, but I was <br/>
so interested in the trolleys that I forgot there was a box there.  <br/>
And I had the clues with me.  Oh well, next time.<br/>
