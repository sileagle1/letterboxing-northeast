I am glad that I wasn't out in the woods!<br/>
<br/>
 We had a vistor at 7:30. Quite large vistor, Don't know if it is male <br/>
or female, but it was here for awhile. I was taking pictures right out <br/>
of the back door, between the slats of blinds. He / she looked right <br/>
at me a few times. Then it tried to climb the tree out by the red <br/>
feeder. OH MY! ! It was awesome. Joe walked in the room and stood at <br/>
the window while I kept Lady quiet.<br/>
<br/>
We were just talking about this subject. Tomorrow the feeders come <br/>
down.. It took my finch bag of feed and laid down over by the trash <br/>
barrels. I took pictures with Joe's camera, I hope they come out.<br/>
