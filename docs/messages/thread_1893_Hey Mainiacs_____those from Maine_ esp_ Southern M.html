Just hoping I can fit some 'boxing in in-between family stuff.<br/>
Email me off list... I'll be leaving Friday morning and may not get <br/>

We've had some excellent melting over the last week or so, and some<br/>
spots have cleared, along with things that heat up well, like rocks,<br/>
but most of the open ground still has a couple feet of icy snow. <br/>
Probably most trails will still be covered and some ground-hugging<br/>
boxes may be hard to get to.  But others may be fine -- in our yard,<br/>
the snow is thinnest, or even gone, on the sunny side of evergreens<br/>
that deflected the snow somewhat, so you may get lucky!  Maybe others<br/>
are seeing better conditions? <br/>
