                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1402266388">The Road to the World Series is a set of two hitchhikers, one for <br/>
the Yankees and one for the Red Sox.  The goal is for each of these <br/>
two HHs to get a higher score than the other.  Both HHs will be <br/>
retired when the Yankees and Red Sox open the season against each <br/>
other on April third.  One point will be awarded to each HH for <br/>
every letterboxer, letterbox and state for which it visits.  However <br/>
we want to keep these HHs in Yankees vs. Red Sox territory so we ask <br/>
that you please do not release it anywhere outside of New England or <br/>
NY.  In addition an extra 5 points will be awarded to each HH if <br/>
they are able to obtain a stamp from all 6 New England states and <br/>
NY.  An additional extra point will also be awarded if the HH <br/>
reaches the opposition's city.  If you come across either of these <br/>
HHs please email us at <a href="mailto:letterboxingct@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">letterboxingct@...</a> with an update.  <br/>
In addition please email us if you have this HH come April 3rd so we <br/>
can make arrangements to get it back from you.  Thanks and good luck <br/>
to both teams *wink wink* (GO YANKEES!!!!!)</div>
