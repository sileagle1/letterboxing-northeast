                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-97873561">My story:  A few months ago I made an unplanned stop at the McLean <br/>
Game Refuge in CT to find a series of boxes. I had the clues <br/>
conveniently filed in a box that I had printed on an earlier date. <br/>
(how much earlier?? I have no idea) Well the clues led me through <br/>
several beautiful forested miles, past the pond with a small shelter, <br/>
and along corn fields, and even to an OLD piece of abandoned farm <br/>
equipment. It was a lovely walk, despite my 100% failure to find a <br/>
single box! As I was exiting the refuge I passed another couple <br/>
heading into the woods, paper in hand:) Clearly letterboxers. I <br/>
wasn't sure if I should say anything about my misfortune (and <br/>
possibly put a damper their hike plans and boxing hopes) so I decided <br/>
to silently walk on..  Anyways I went home , thinking, thinking... <br/>
about that couple and their clues.. and so I looked at the clues <br/>
online, and egads! they were all different!! Obviously they had been <br/>
rewritten since my print date. grrr. I made my mind up that I would <br/>
have to go back and do the series, especially since I enjoyed the <br/>
hike for it's own sake, so much.  Well here I am, ready to get out <br/>
there this week, and I can't find the clues. I can't even remember <br/>
the name of the series. So, easily, I could be looking in the wrong <br/>
place. Can someone please tell me the name of the series? Are the <br/>
clues still listed?  someone please help me =S     K*</div>
