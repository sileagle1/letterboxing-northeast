Hello all you l.b. monster hunters!! Believe it or not, a mere<br/>
month from tomorrow we will all be meeting, greeting, eating,<br/>
exchanging, and hunting down some creepy letterboxes.<br/>
I need to get a head count..no, not a SEVERED head, but an INTACT<br/>
head count. The Mash hosts/hostesses would appreciate having some<br/>
idea of how many plan to attend so they can have enough hotdogs,<br/>
papergoods, etc. at hand. Please bring a potluck dish to share if<br/>
you can. (No electricity available though).<br/>
Even if you have e-mailed the sponsers of this event, please<br/>
contact me. We are trying to come up with one all-inclusive list of<br/>
Mashers. Would you please list the first names of everyone in your<br/>
party, plus last initials (if you don't mind) and l.b. nicknames?<br/>
Bringing any 4-footed pals? Let me know that too.<br/>
I think it would be great to have a list which includes all of you<br/>
(no last names), plus the town (or at least) state you are from. If<br/>
you are o.k. with that, let me know and I'll send this list out to<br/>
attendees after the fact. (Or may be before).<br/>
Long live letterboxing!<br/>
