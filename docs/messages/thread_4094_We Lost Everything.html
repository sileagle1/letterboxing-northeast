We thought we'd find a couple of boxes and then go to the movies. <br/>
Great Plan! <br/>
Unfortunately, after our last letterbox - Forgotten Families # 9 &amp; 10 (great cemetery, by the way!) in West Warwick, RI, <br/>
we forgot our letterboxing bag on the trunk and drove off down Church St. towards Cowesett Ave. <br/>
We think between St. Mary's Church and the next Cemetery (#8) the bag came off the car. <br/>
We noticed we didn't have the bag when we got to Route 2. <br/>
We retraced our "steps" and drove back to the cemetery on Church St., but found nothing but our bottle of Technu in the street. <br/>
We asked at the Church if anyone found the bag, but no luck. We will leave our contact information with the rectory this evening.<br/>
<br/>
The bag is a navy blue fanny pack with two patches on the front pocket - AQ and LBMA.<br/>
Inside the bag there is our stamps! (including personal travelers), our logbook!, a zippered bag of ink pens and pads, Dave's lensatic compass, and my favorite compass with reverse azimuth capability. There is also a newly-found Hitchhiker!<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, we lost interest in the movie (maybe tomorrow).<br/>
<br/>
We can re-find the letterboxes in the logbook, we can re-carve the tower and the mobius braid personal stamps - don't know if we can find the sheep stamp - she's been with us from the very beginning - May 10, 2003!<br/>
So, if you're from (or in) the West Warwick, RI area and find our bag we will be totally indebted to you --<br/>
as reward - the HH is yours and a fresh new block of pink stuff.<br/>
<br/>
So, think good thoughts that our bag will find it's way home to us; fortunately there were only about 33 stamp images in this logbook.<br/>
On the drive home, Dave and I thought that maybe the finder would wonder what this letterboxing stuff is all about and discover a new hobby!<br/>
<br/>
Bye for now - got some re-carving to do!<br/>

leaves were falling and I posted it 'found' on our trails website.  The<br/>
owner was shocked to see the notice a couple weeks later. If there is a sign<br/>

into the Parks or Conservation Departments; if it's a Land Trust someone in<br/>
that organization might know about it. <br/>

Good luck.  I lost my camera boxing last fall after I set it down on the<br/>

It came off the trunk of the car very close to the Church, just as Mass was starting.<br/>
If smoeone in the neighborhood finds it, I'm sure we'll hear.<br/>

  Were you in a particular park managed by some group or town? If the bag fell<br/>
  off the trunk near the parking lot someone might turn it in. I had a car<br/>
  key turned in to me once (I work for a town) during the fall when all the<br/>
  leaves were falling and I posted it 'found' on our trails website. The<br/>
  owner was shocked to see the notice a couple weeks later. If there is a sign<br/>
  kiosk a note might be posted there; if it's a town park it might be turned<br/>
  into the Parks or Conservation Departments; if it's a Land Trust someone in<br/>
  that organization might know about it. <br/>
<br/>
  Good luck. I lost my camera boxing last fall after I set it down on the<br/>
  pavement getting into my car. Just left it there in the parking lot. <br/>

  Hoping for the best! Losing a logbook would be horrible... glad to know it<br/>
  didn't have too many images in it yet. Did you have your name, phone number<br/>

  Thanks anyway, we looked as well. We've posted signs and I'll wait a week<br/>
  before I go shopping.<br/>
  Maybe if I carve a new stamp....<br/>
