finally made my way over here. (:  Thanks for having me!<br/>
<br/>
Today, a friend and I went to Exeter to find the Lucky Charms <br/>
series....VERY nice walk and all of the boxes are in great shape!  <br/>
We also found "Citrus Zest" HH and have moved it on!  Take <br/>
care....hope to see some of you at the Monster Mash (and stamped <br/>
into my relatively new series, Camping Memories, in Swansea,MA!)<br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails,<br/>
Kerri<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  By the way, I, too am doing the happy dance.  I started this <br/>
craziness in May with the goal of reaching F100 by the time that I <br/>
had to go back to school and be a teacher again.  Today marked P8 <br/>
