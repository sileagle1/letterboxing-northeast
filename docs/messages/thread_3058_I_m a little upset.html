                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-258852407">OK.  I've been pretty quiet up until now, but I feel as though I <br/>
really need to say this....<br/>
<br/>
Please DO NOT put the locations of mystery boxes in clues for <br/>
traditional letterboxes!  It is not fair to the planter of the <br/>
mystery box, since the planter either wanted it to be a difficult <br/>
mystery, or didn't want too much traffic to the box, as it may <br/>
compromise the box.<br/>
<br/>
I've contacted the placer of the trad. letterbox, asking him to <br/>
delete the small section of clues pertaining to the mystery box.  <br/>
The placer didn't need to add that information to make the clues <br/>
work, and all it did was compromise another box.<br/>
<br/>
OK... I'm through venting now.  BTW..... if I don't hear back from <br/>
the planter, can whomever on the LBNA site delete the three or four <br/>
words from the clues?  Please let me know if this can be done.<br/>

Thank you for listening.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1032946662">i would like to add to this. not only should clues to a mystery box not be<br/>
mentioned in regular clues they should not be mentioned anywhere that the<br/>
placer themselves have not either given permission or listed. recently i was<br/>
at a box and in the logbook was a reference to a mystery of mine. the<br/>
location was given innocently enough but it was still there, the location<br/>
named and the fact that it was a mystery. mysteries should not be labled as<br/>
to location in your personal logbook either. you never know who might be<br/>
looking at it.<br/>
