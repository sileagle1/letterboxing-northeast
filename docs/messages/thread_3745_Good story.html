West Burying Grounds yesterday and the box appeared to be missing.  As<br/>
we were leaving, we were approached by a grounds-keeper who handed us<br/>
the box!  Apparently his daughter had found it and gave it to him.  He<br/>
knew what it was but hadn't gotten around to replacing it.  When he<br/>
saw us hunting around the tree, he realized that was probably what we<br/>
were looking for so he brought it to us.  The box in now back in its<br/>
hiding place.  A nice flat rock might be a good addition to the hiding<br/>
cover material.  We did the best we could with sticks.  What a great<br/>
stamp!  We're so glad we got it.<br/>
