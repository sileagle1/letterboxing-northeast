Hopefully there will be a gathering that we can make it to this <br/>
summer.  We've never been but look forward to the opportunity to <br/>
meet other letterboxers.  "Eventually" though.<br/>

<br/>
We've gotten quite a few RSVP's for the gathering on Sunday, but I'm sure we <br/>
will have many folks come that we haven't heard from.<br/>
<br/>
You should come expecting to get TONS of exchanges and meet lots of people. <br/>
The food is potluck, though CSCM and I will provide soft drinks.<br/>
<br/>
There are boxes to find on the sanctuary and there will be event-only stamps.<br/>
<br/>
You may want to consider sunscreen and insect repellent. We will likely be <br/>
under the canopy awnings in the field next to the nature center.<br/>
<br/>
We are very much looking forward to meeting several new 'boxers. If 80 people <br/>
in January of last year is anything to judge by, we should have quite a <br/>
showing on summer's day.<br/>
<br/>
See you then!<br/>
