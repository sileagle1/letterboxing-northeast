                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1762812875">Weird.  I mailed the logbook first.  Got back into the car and realized that while shuffling things around to make sure the address was correct, I left the stamp and ink in the car. I had just the right size envelope for those, so I dashed back through the traffic to mail it, and the PO was locked.  I talked my way in, though, explaining that I had left something out of the package I had just mailed.  She let me in and I mailed the second to the exact same address and insured it, also.  Funny thing was, she said the truck had already picked up the first pkg., and it would be delivered the very next day.  That was Monday.  I have a tracking number at home.  I would suspect that they will not leave it (the log book pkg) without someone to sign for it because it was insured for a lot more than the second.  Check for one of those delivery notices.  I'll send to you the tracking number I have at home when I get there.<br/>
