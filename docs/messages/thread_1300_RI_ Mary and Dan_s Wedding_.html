Box in North Scituate, RI, which was placed as a one day only box in honor of <br/>
their wedding!  Their bridesmaid Warrior Woman was thoughtful to put out the <br/>
box.  Though it was pouring rain, both Moonstone and I found it successfully!  <br/>
We then headed out to do other boxes, most of them library ones while the rain <br/>
continued to pour.  By 3:00 p.m. the rain had almost stopped, which I was <br/>
thankful since Mary and Dan's wedding was starting in North Scituate!  After <br/>
finishing up our wet boxing adventure, I decided to drive through North Scituate <br/>
on the way home, and what do I see??????  Mary coming out of the church in her <br/>
gown after the ceremony!  She looked absolutely gorgeous!!!!!!!  What a <br/>
special treat!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations Mary and Dan!  I hope you have many wonderful years <br/>

Thanks for coming in the pouring rain to stamp into our wedding lb. We had planned on being at the Monster Mash, camping nearby with Dan's parent's camper.  But my new father in law apparently forgot about telling Dan we could use it and has made other camping plans.  I'm not sure how we are going or staying but we still plan on attending, and will bring our wedding day event box.  Maybe by then we will have some nice pictures.  It was a wonderful day for us.<br/>
