I suggest we post the areas where we are planting boxes.  My partner Tiny Turtle lost 2 placement sites, after spending 2 weeks, 2 hikes, and other activities aimed at placing boxes there.  Someone beat her to a prime spot.<br/>
<br/>
  I will start by posting the areas where I will be planting.<br/>
