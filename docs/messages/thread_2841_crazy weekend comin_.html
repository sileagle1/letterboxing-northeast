traveling to connecticut from new hampshire so i can find some <br/>
easter eggs. i plan on leaving at 4:30 in the morning. here's why! <br/>

to pick up my grandmother who lives in baltic, CT i fugured that i <br/>
could drive down to CT find those eggs, maybe some others boxes, <br/>
grab my grandmother, drive all the way north to conway, and then do <br/>
some more boxing there after the party. oh the baby shower starts at <br/>
1. i think i have plenty of time. <br/>
<br/>
and then, sunday is Ice Scream Sunday! this will be my second event <br/>
and i want to leave extra early in the morning. I have not found a <br/>
single box in MA yet! i have found 20 in CT, 15 in RI, 11 in NY. All <br/>
these boxes were found "AFTER" driving through MA. Go figure. i dont <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-414071662">That's the way I feel about CT! That state (my former home for 20+ years) is just ripe for <br/>
the picking. I mean letterbox heaven and I haven't found any in the wild there yet. I did <br/>
find event boxes at the Manchester Gather but I'm going to get started on my CT F count <br/>
real soon. And I plan to starting in my hometown of Avon!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>
P.S. MA has some fantastic boxes. Have fun!!<br/>
