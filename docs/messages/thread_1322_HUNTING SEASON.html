It is time to get out all those very chic fluorescent orange garments. You know you love them. They just go with everything. You have been waiting all year just to have an excuse to wear them again so now here's your chance.  That Fluorescent orange plastic vest does wonders for your figure I know it does for mine. The cheap plastic vest or hat goes for about a buck (no pun intended)  each at Walmart. Keep a look out for that crazied women with the fluorescent orange garments and you could have an exchange if you dare to approach, most don't. They seem to run in the opposite direction. I'm not sure why? Oh well, be chic and safe.<br/>
