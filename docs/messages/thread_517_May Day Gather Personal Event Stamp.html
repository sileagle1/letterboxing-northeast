honor of the Nipmuc indians who used  the area as their fishing grounds. May <br/>
also marks the beginning of the indian New Year. This stamp will be altered <br/>
after the Gather and placed somewhere as an ongoing letterbox. To obtain this <br/>
box; you must be able to tell me the name of the Nipmuc indian chief who was <br/>
killed in 1619. Safe Trails!<br/>
