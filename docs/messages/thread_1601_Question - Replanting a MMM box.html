Can a box that was "retired" from the MMM be replanted somewhere else <br/>
and counted as a different "F" for the finder who might already have <br/>
the stamp from the MMM?  Just wondering...<br/>

If it is a new set of clues - maybe a new box name - it is not the <br/>
Finders fault the Planter placed a 'used' stamp.  I say it is a "F".  <br/>
But I would mention in the clues it is a transplant from the MMM, <br/>
someone may not want to go after something they already have.  <br/>
<br/>
As for me I have too much fun carving stamps and will retire my MMM <br/>
stamps permanently --- unless someone comes knocking on my door.<br/>
<br/>
And Sue, thanks for the Cleaning Up HH that passed thru one of my <br/>
boxes.  It was a treat to see.<br/>

Glad I was home sick today to get this surprise package!<br/>
