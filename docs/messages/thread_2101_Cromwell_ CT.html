to find Jack &amp; the Beanstalk in Cromwell, CT yesterday, we found a box <br/>
that had been through the CT river flood earlier this spring. The <br/>
entire box was soaking wet and the log book was basically destroyed. We <br/>
decided to take the whole thing with us. I have tried to contact the <br/>
placer, fjordhorselynn, to let them know, but have not heard back as of <br/>
yet. If anyone knows them (him/her), please have them contact me. <br/>
Again, there is no longer a box at that location. Great stamp, too! I <br/>
was glad we were able to at least get the impression. Hope everyone has <br/>
a good weekend. <br/>

looking a little rough at that time, damp and the logbook was pretty full  as I <br/>
recall.  I never received a reply from them and now hearing that you  haven't <br/>
heard either, maybe they are no longer willing or able to maintain the  boxes. <br/>
