It was great to go to a second gathering, so I could spend more time socializing than exchanging!  The first is always, er, busy.  Thanks to Rustypuff and CSCM for a bueno fiesta!  Such a neat event stamp, and the traveling event stamp The Cat and the Canary, too!<br/>
    Afterwards, we didn't find 'Boulders' letterbox, and daylight was fading.  We jumped over to Borderland State Park and just barely had time to find Kirby and his friends Waddle Dee and Adeleine before they closed the gates.<br/>

A Fine Day Out.<br/>
