<br/>
(You'll all have to forgive me for all the shrieking!)<br/>
<br/>
I can't BELIEVE all the new folks I met - it was like having a <br/>
backstage pass for the most star-studded rock concert imaginable!<br/>
<br/>
I just counted 25 new exchanges!  Lots of familiar names from far <br/>
away places, and LOTS of new letterboxers!  I just know I didn't get <br/>
to exchange with everyone - and WOW! what a turnout!  So many old <br/>
friends, too (waves to everybody) !!!  <br/>
<br/>
Did I mention the FOOD ?!?!  Just remember, folks, I have a folder in <br/>
the "Files" section for Mystery Gathering recipes, if you are willing <br/>
to share!<br/>
<br/>
And did you see the HUGE pile of coats for Operation Cover Up?  What <br/>
a generous bunch of people!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Tom No One, for another FANTASTIC Mystery Gathering.  What <br/>
would we do without you!<br/>
<br/>
Warrior Woman<br/>
still *gushing* over meeting Amanda from Seattle, among others<br/>
<br/>
p.s.  Now I get to hunt down all the Angels this upcoming weekend.  <br/>
The gathering that keeps on giving!</div>
