We're trying something a bit different and hope it works. We have included the usual "First Finder" Certificate and then because there were more boxes we included second, third and fourth finder certificates. So, hopefully the first finder will get the first one, the second ones to find the second box get the second certificate, etc.<br/>
Remember to be discreet while boxing, if possible post a watcher. This particular hiking area is well traveled - even on weekdays and in winter.<br/>

series' and felt like it was sort of pointless to do a certificate for every<br/>
one in the series because most likely the first person to do the series<br/>
would get all the certificates.<br/>
<br/>
But a SECOND finder, THIRD finder . . .  EXCELLENT!! I will have to use this<br/>
method next time.<br/>

Dear VonderInsels,<br/>
<br/>
THANK YOU for such a wonderful Christmas present!  I had planned on <br/>
doing box maintenance on my one placed and two adopted boxes on Rome <br/>
Point during the winter school break - now I'll get a very special <br/>
treat while I'm at it!<br/>
