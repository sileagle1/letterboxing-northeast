specifically!  The One for the History Books Event is coming along <br/>
fabulously!  The letterboxing community has been so wonderful helping <br/>
me to prepare for this event.  Boxers that I have never met have come <br/>
out of the woodwork (or is that the woods?) to carve, to offer insight <br/>
and to help with planning. Thanks a bunch to all of you! <br/>
<br/>
I only have one "problem" now.....we need more boxers to attend!  I <br/>
have listed some hotels/cabins in the Skowhegan area for lodging on the <br/>
AQ website.  If you are interested in splitting a room, let me know, I <br/>
can contact some of the other people staying in the area that weekend <br/>
and see if we can set something up.  I am very sure that anyone who <br/>
chooses to spend at least one night in the area will not be <br/>
disappointed by the number of boxes here to find.  We'll keep you <br/>
plenty busy for a couple days!  <br/>
<br/>
And, on top of accomodations and loads of boxes....I'm guaranteeing <br/>
perfect boxing weather and lots of fun!  It doesn't get any better than <br/>
that!  Take a few minutes to check out the One for the History Books <br/>
Event listed on AQ.  I promise you, you won't regret the trip!</div>

<br/>
I'm holding you to your promise of 50 people to History Books! We've <br/>
just cleared 35 with those who have RSVPed and those that I know who <br/>
are coming and have not RSVPed.  Looks like you've got a little work <br/>
to do to get us up to 50!  :)  I'll be doing some serious PR in NH in <br/>
March too, so that should help.  See you there, if not sooner!<br/>
