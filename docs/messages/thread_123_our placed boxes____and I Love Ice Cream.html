Just received a message that the log for this box either is full...or<br/>
is very close to being full. I should have it replaced mid-week next<br/>
week ( tonight is my first night back to work ).<br/>
<br/>
As for other logbooks, we recently added to Gorton Family Cemetery.<br/>
Avery Tract Series is about 1/2 full and anxiously awaits more<br/>
visitors. Our non-posted "Celtic Knot Series" at Stenger's Farm is<br/>
also alive and well as of last week! If anyone has visited "The<br/>
Bravset", "Hurricane", "Gray Rock Extras" recently, I'd love to hear<br/>
about their condition.<br/>

<br/>
PS - We've not heard of our HH's (Heidi's B-Day, Lillies of the<br/>
Thames) in quite some time. If you've had and replaced these, we'd<br/>
also love to hear from you so I can track them down.</div>
