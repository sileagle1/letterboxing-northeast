who helped put on this event- Maplines, that's you!  We had a ball <br/>
even boxing in the rain.  Thanks to all for the boxes- those flower <br/>
stamps are fabulous!  If anyone found a blue and silver papermate <br/>
pen, use it in good health and if you still have it the next time we <br/>
meet, I might ask for it back :0)  I always manage to leave something <br/>
behind- this time it was my pen and a serving spoon- Oh Well! I came <br/>
away with a LB Kit and a new recipe for "cornbread". It's always <br/>
great to meet up with old friends and make new ones,too- Happy Boxing <br/>
Everyone!- Sunshine, Swamp Yankee, and the ToadDog</div>
