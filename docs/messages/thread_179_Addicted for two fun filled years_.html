<br/>
Martin Luther King Day marks the anniversary of letterboxing for <br/>
Jonathan and me.  We have many great stories from all of our travels <br/>
and we have all of you to thank for placing the boxes that we seek.  <br/>
I took the time this past week to look through my letterboxing <br/>
journals.  It is amazing to see the one hundred boxes I found in my <br/>
first 2 months.  The most poignant memory is finding my 100 box <br/>
at 'Miles of Ledges' ... what a beautiful hike!  What's worse is <br/>
looking at the number of boxes I HAVN'T found this year.  Since last <br/>
years Mass gathering, I have only found 70 boxes (not including <br/>
boxes from Dartmoor).  Jonathan and I have decided to celebrate this <br/>
anniversary (and maybe help me hit 500 finds) by going letterboxing <br/>
on our day off from school.  We figure we'll head up to Stafford <br/>
area, since there seems to be some nice long hikes with lots of <br/>
boxes along the trail.  If anyone wishes to join us in celebration, <br/>
drop me an email this afternoon/evening and we can make some plans.<br/>
Otherwise, Safe Letterboxing-<br/>
