Atlas Quest has a nice city search. Unfortunately, it <br/>
doesn't have as many boxes as letterboxing.org, but it <br/>
shows some boxes if you enter Laconia, NH with 50 mile <br/>
radius.<br/>

Center Harbor, Guilford, Holderness, Ashland, Moultonborough, Arlington and <br/>
further south toward Concord.<br/>

those in Notch area might be tough right now.<br/>
Better wait for the January thaw or spring-- whichever comes first. LOL<br/>
My LBs in that area are on trails that are very icy and buried deeply in the <br/>
white stuff I'm sure. <br/>

Laconia just yet.  We have some plans for some but now with winter <br/>
here they will need to wait.  We've planted some (Son of a Sailor's <br/>
Covered Bridge Series) that range from 10 minutes away to almost an <br/>
hour away.  There are at least 3 in Gilford, the next town over.  <br/>
Your friend is free to contact us.  With weather and renovations, <br/>
we've had to put our hobby on hold for a few months.  <br/>
