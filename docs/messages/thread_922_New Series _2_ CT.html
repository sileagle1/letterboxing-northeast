Hampton, CT<br/>
<br/>
Planted by Rosie Bunny and Irish Tinker<br/>
<br/>
These boxes were inspired by 2 of four-year-old<br/>
<br/>
Rosie Bunny's favorite characters! We'd love to hear what you thought.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoy! Sing Along!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From Route 97, take Kenyon Road. Turn onto Griffon Road. Take first right on<br/>
to well maintained dirt road. Follow 2 miles. Just past gas line and turn<br/>
left on the unmarked road. Trail is almost immediately on the left.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Help Dora, Map, Backpack, and Boots find the box. Go around the wooden gate.<br/>
Trail bends left. Go through a clearing. At the end of clearing count 4<br/>
paces. Turn right and walk to the double tree. Right behind double tree is<br/>
long stone. Behind long stone is the box.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Box 2<br/>
<br/>
"Come on in<br/>
What did you say?<br/>
"A clue, a clue!"<br/>
You see a clue?<br/>
Another Blue's Clues day, hooray!<br/>
Do you wanna play . . .<br/>
<br/>
Who's clues?? Blue's Clues!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Joe, Steve, and Blue have collected all the clues. Can you help them find<br/>
the box?<br/>
<br/>
Back to trail. Turn right. Where trail bends right you take trail to the<br/>
left. Go through Mountain Laurel. Spy a large, round, mossy stone on the<br/>
right. Count 9 paces. Look under large rock on left with small triangular<br/>
rock on top.</div>
