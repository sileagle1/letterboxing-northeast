The "What's New" link appears on "My Page" as a button at the bottom of my widget for "Newest Traditional Letterboxes".  I think that's what you're looking for...<br/>

&gt; in the top right had corner of your page, right under where it says "my page<br/>
&gt;  you will find a button that says "add widgets". a widget is basically the<br/>
&gt; box that has a specific function, such as "newest traditional letterboxes". <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; if you click on the "add widgets" it will bring you to a page that you can<br/>

Actually, I was reading Ryans Blog (link on the AQ homepage) and he gave instructions for adding links back in like the What's New link and the My Tags link.  I did that and it has been working very well.  Just like the old site.<br/>
