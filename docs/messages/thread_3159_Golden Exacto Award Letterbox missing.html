found just the box and no log book or stamp.  Apparently someone had <br/>
strewn the contents around and left them out in the rain, as the box <br/>
was open and full of water.  "Follow the Son" was unable to find the <br/>
logbook or stamp.  I will get up there soon to see if I can locate the <br/>
remains.  If at all possible I will replant with new clues.  Update to <br/>
follow.<br/>
<br/>
Very upsetting to see such wanton distruction just for some hollow <br/>
jollies.  I do not believe it was boxers who did this, just someone who <br/>
discovered the box and has a mean streak a mile wide.<br/>

crew has pursued boxes placed by myself and Isosceles with the most<br/>
dedication and patience. There are some out there that just don't<br/>
understand letterboxing and those are the few vandals that spoil it<br/>
for others. We're quite sad to hear of this box's fate :(<br/>
