Mica Ledges in Durham on New Year's Day.  A great way to start out <br/>
the new year.  Anyone who hasn't ventured here yet, should make a <br/>
point of getting there. The outlook is truly special.  A trail <br/>
exchange with the Lady and a Whippet and the Englishman, completed <br/>
our day.  Toad's first Whippet encounter!!! Thanks to the Gal Pals <br/>
for a job well done!! Sunshine, Swamp Yankee and the ToadDog</div>
