                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-290914001">Hey, guys.  OK, so we have an issue on our hands here.  I mean, AQ is great, <br/>
but we all know that there are lots of boxes that are only on LBNA, and while <br/>
we're still waiting for that to come up...<br/>
<br/>
I have a bunch of clues on my hard drive for all around Connecticut.  The <br/>
reason is that when I go to a town, I cut and paste all the clues onto one sheet <br/>
in order to save ink and paper when printing.  I save these files because I <br/>
might want to print them out again next time I go.  So I have a lot.  I'm sure <br/>
other people have stashes as well.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of posting some of these to this list.  I'm not talking about <br/>
WOMs or anything.  I'm talking about clues that, up until a few days ago, were <br/>
online for the whole world to see.  What do you guys think?  General <br/>
consensus?<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, if you're hoping to go to a particular place in CT, try <br/>
posting a cry for help here.  I'm sure someone can get back to you with the clues <br/>
you're asking for.  :)<br/>

<br/>
That would be awesome. I was about to begin letterboxing with <br/>
three newbies . They were away for the first part of the summer and I was <br/>
about take them out when the site disappeared. I am looking for something near <br/>
New Britian, Meriden, Bristol maybe even Middletown. I would like three sites as <br/>
I want each one of them to lead the expedition. They are all about the age of <br/>
9 and are quite competitive. LOL<br/>
<br/>
We probably won't do anything until the following week but if you have some <br/>
suggestions and info I sure would love it.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you <br/>
