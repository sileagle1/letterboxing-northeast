We knew we were taking a chance as the site appeared to be a party spot.<br/>
We're running out of places to hide this little critter. <br/>
With Dave down in NJ, we knew we would have touble keeping tabs on our Northern boxes.<br/>
So, please make sure that when you visit one of our boxes that you re-hide really well.<br/>

The first box was under the bridge and washed away with the spring freschet and the second was on higher ground above the falls. Dave says that the otter is pretty easy to carve, so I think he wants to replace it. But, with his activation we find ourselves with fewer trips to VT.<br/>
