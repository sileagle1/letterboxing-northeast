series at East Rock Park.<br/>
The main reason was the uneasiness we ourselves were feeling in the <br/>
parking lots there.<br/>
It was a crystal clear day with unlimited visibility. Two hawks were <br/>
soaring on updrafts overhead, and fittingly, a Cessna kept circling <br/>
the Rock as we pulled the boxes.<br/>
Thanks to all who were "brave" enough to come to our urban park to <br/>
box. Special apologies to "System and SAB" who recently wrote in the <br/>
logbooks that they were coming back with a compass to find box #2.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Sorry to see them go, but I understand your decision, Sadie and <br/>
Russ.  In this case it's not what's best for the letterbox, but the <br/>
letterboxer - the area's not safe any more.  I have a box of my own <br/>
in the same park and haven't been to check on it in a year, simply <br/>
because I don't feel comfortable walking around there, even with my <br/>
dogs.  You've got me thinking that it's probably time to retire or <br/>
relocate it - how can I expect others to go there, if I don't feel <br/>
safe there myself....?  That responsibility can't be pushed over onto <br/>
the LbNA Waiver of Responsibility!<br/>
<br/>
I've also "adopted" a letterbox from the LbNA "basement of unclaimed <br/>
boxes" that's located there in East Rock Park, "Revival of the <br/>
Alchemy Series - Mercury".  It has been there since June 2002 and has <br/>
fared well the entire time.  I am reluctant to move it, since it's <br/>
not my own, and certainly wouldn't retire it, but again feel that for <br/>
the safety of those who come in search of it, it should be in a more <br/>
secure location.  Must give this some serious thought!<br/>
