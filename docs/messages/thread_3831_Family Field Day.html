The Hartford Audubon Society is having a celebration of their 100th <br/>
aniversary.  They will be holding a Family Field Day at Northwest Park <br/>
in Windsor, CT, on Sunday Oct 5 from 8 to 4.<br/>
<br/>
We hope to have lots of families there, and have activities and <br/>
exhibits for the whole family.<br/>
<br/>
Would anyone like to come there to set up a booth on letterboxing?  <br/>
There are lots of letterboxes in the park, and this would be a great <br/>
opportunity to introduce the hobby to a receptive audience.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
