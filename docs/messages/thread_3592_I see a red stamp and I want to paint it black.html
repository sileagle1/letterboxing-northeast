                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-943744049">I hear you about coloring rubber stamps with magic markers, but my logbook looks so much nicer these days now that I'm taking the time to use different colors.  I'm sure you'll get a lot of advice about what markers to use.  I use Marvy Markers.  However, it's not just the type of marker, but your technique.  Markers dry up on the stamp much quicker than an ink from an ink pad.  After swatting all the mosquitoes, wiping your sweaty face and being very discreet so as not to draw attention to yourself - mark up the stamp with all the markers.  Now for the very important part - huff on the stamp.  Say haaaaaaa within an inch or 2 from the stamp.  The moisture from your breath will revive the inks.  Now look at it closely.  You'll see that it is shiny.  If there is an area that isn't shiny, then you probably forgot to color that section.  Color up that part and huff on it again.  Now put the image in your book.  Sometimes if the stamp has a lot of colors and you stamp it once,<br/>
 you can huff on it again and stamp it again without coloring it up again.  I do this sometimes when letterboxing with a buddy so as not to take up a lot of time.  It usually works, but comes out a little lighter.<br/>
<br/>
  I tend to carve a positive image for my stamps where the outlines are there and the stamp can be done in one color - usually black.  The image is sort of something you'd see in a coloring book and it you want to color it in at home, that's up to you.  Makes things easier, but many people still use different colors on the outline.  Go figure!<br/>
<br/>
  Enjoy!<br/>

The color that is already on the stamp can mess up your markers.  You won't want to ruin them, especially if you spent a lot of money on them.
