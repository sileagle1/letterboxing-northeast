  Well here is the snake story, Me (moonbeam) Kreepy Kelly and Northstar went boxing and kelly suggested this park that had 7 boxes in a 30 min hike, it was just starting to get dark so we figured it would be a good hike for the end of the day, well the park was all muddy there were bugs galor and the stamps were ok, we were at the last box (bonus) and kelly seen a little garner snake and picked it up, Northstar screamed like a bitch and ran back to the trail while me and kelly were laughing at him, we all couldn't wait to get back to the car to take are mud fill shoes off when northstar informed us he couldn't find the keys,That is the only set I have, so we searched around the car, we asked people if they seen anything, Then me and kelly said we would go back on the mud filled trail to look if he dropped them at any of the boxes.We did the whole hike again trudging threw all the water and mud again just to have kelly find the keys in the dirt at the bonus box( at the<br/>
 being of the hike!!!) We wanted to kill Northstar! so word of advice to anybody boxing with Northstar DON'T SHOW HIM ANY SNAKES if you want to make it back home!!!<br/>
