Anyway, wanted to offer a head's up to anyone in that area, as it's a common<br/>

shot a rabid possum earlier in the day..so there are definitely affected<br/>
animals in the area.<br/>

&gt;I was out hiking in Uxbridge today, out in the Goat Hill area.  I had my<br/>
&gt;19mos daughter with me in a backpack, and thankfully, NO dogs.   We were<br/>
&gt;almost done with our hike when we came upon a huge raccoon (probably 20lbs)<br/>

</span></blockquote>FWIW, I would caution that any animal acting strangely is suspect, be <br/>
it skunk, 'possum, 'coon or [insert your favorite critter here].  Any <br/>
nocturnal critter out in daylight hours (possible exception, <br/>
spring=young to feed) is a red flag for me.  Same for any animal that <br/>
doesn't immediately disappear as I approach; if it doesn't melt into <br/>
the background pronto, it probably isn't right...<br/>
<br/>
FYI, two rabid racoons have been killed recently by dogs in <br/>
Manchester, CT.  Use care out there.<br/>
