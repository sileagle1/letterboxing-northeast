<br/>
Sue &amp; I walked to Timberlin Park in Kensington, CT tonight after<br/>
supper to get a few letterboxes. And sometime during that walk, I lost<br/>
a rare, Roman coin that was a gift from my college roommate. This coin<br/>
has been with me as my lucky charm in Dartmoor and many other places.<br/>
<br/>
I had it in my pocket when I found Astri's monthly boxes and it was<br/>
there after we found Butterfly Suzy's new Yo-Yo box. After that, I<br/>
noticed a huge, debarked stump that it looked as if the woodpeckers<br/>
had visited and that was the last I remember it being in my pocket.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sick about losing it and I know, in the past, others have posted<br/>
about lost hats, glasses, etc. I hope the letterboxing community will<br/>
come to my aid.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

In the meantime, if might be helpful for the searches to tell them where you walked after passing the debarked stump Knowing your walk up to that point at least gets them on the right trail , the direction  from the stump to your car is important .<br/>
  smile anyway <br/>

detector, which would be handy.  Long lost?  Where? Searching for<br/>
"lost treasure" sounds like fun...<br/>
