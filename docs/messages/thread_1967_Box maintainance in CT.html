replaced everything but the stamp.  Seems my little bird took a swim<br/>
in the recent flooding of the area. I came home with purple hands!<br/>
;-) Fortunately he wasn't lost, just soaked. Until I get a better<br/>
stamp pad, I would encourage you to bring your own ink.  The marker<br/>
pen that I left in the box today doesn't work as well as a pad<br/>
because of the size of the stamp. I'm drying out the log book and<br/>
some of the imprints and writings are still legible, I'm happy to<br/>
say.  I also changed the box at Countryside Park.  Thanks, JBean, for<br/>
the report of the cracked cover.  However, I forgot to replace pens<br/>
in both boxes so have one with you when you seek these, at least<br/>
until I get back to them again.   <br/>
