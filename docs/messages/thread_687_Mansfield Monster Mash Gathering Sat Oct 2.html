A letterboxing gathering will be held Saturday October<br/>
2nd 2004 from 12 to 4 at the Lions Club Soccer fields<br/>
pavilion off route 89 in Mansfield CT. More details to<br/>
come.  Itï¿½s being organized by Chuck &amp; Molly,<br/>
Chickabirdie, The NeeDeeps, and Teach &amp; Preach. In<br/>
conjunction with this event, letterboxes will be put<br/>
out all over the town of Mansfield and will be<br/>
available only from October 1st to October 31st.  As<br/>
of November 1st they will all be picked up, taken<br/>
away, gone, never to return. The theme of the stamps<br/>
for the October boxes will be movie and TV monsters<br/>
and science fiction characters. Anyone wanting to make<br/>
up a box with this theme please do so. We can plant it<br/>
for you and pick it up again November 1st, you will be<br/>
given full recognition, it will be your box and you<br/>
count it as a plant. We would like the boxes by<br/>
September 1st so we can have time to get out and plant<br/>
them and write the clues. To help us by making a box,<br/>
contact me and tell me what you will be carving so we<br/>
know what and how many boxes are being done. We are<br/>
hoping to have a really good time at this gathering as<br/>
the monsters go berserk in Mansfield.<br/>
