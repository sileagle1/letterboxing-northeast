These were our first plants and Sadie's first carvings.<br/>
<br/>
Maine Man was becoming increasing difficult to find due to the foliage <br/>
growth in the area and now Marco Man's hiding spot has been <br/>
compromised.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Gingerlbd for alerting us to the situation and doing her <br/>
best to hide Marco Man out of sight.  Both boxes are safely home now.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who visited over the past three and a half years.<br/>
We might plant something else out that way!<br/>
