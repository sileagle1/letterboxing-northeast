<br/>
<br/>
Sue and I are gearing up for this Sunday's POE Gathering and after <br/>
gathering meal at Tweed's restaurant. We can hardly wait!<br/>
<br/>
The weather looks terrific and Sue will bring her famous Jewish <br/>
Coffee Cake. I will be sporting a new traveler and the fantastic "La <br/>
Poste en Boulive" postal letterbox [with La Choula's blessing] among <br/>
other goodies.<br/>
<br/>
I have recently created a New England Area Gathering page on my <br/>
website [Thanks, Isoceles, for the plug last week!] If you need <br/>
times, directions or want to see a sample Tweed's menu, click the New <br/>
England Area Gatherings off of my main page and there are links for <br/>
POE as well as the gathering coming up later in March in Wells, Maine.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing friends old and new!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there and box!!! [And attend the POE]<br/>
