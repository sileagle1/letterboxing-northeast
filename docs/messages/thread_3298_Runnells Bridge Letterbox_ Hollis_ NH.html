better do it again!<br/>
<br/>
Box was recently vandalized. It's amazing that it lasted so long as <br/>
this area is pretty busy in the spring and summer. A big Thank You goes <br/>
to White Ash for rescuing all the pieces and returning them to me. It's <br/>
my very first placement and so has a special place in my heart.<br/>
