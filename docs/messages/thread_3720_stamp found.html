stamp wrapped in green felt and tied with hemp in a plastic baggie on<br/>

is of what appears to be a cowboy (or cowgirl) with brown suit and red<br/>
hat.  Does anyone recognize this?  <br/>

</span></blockquote>Thanks for posting this Bell Lady. My mom lost that earlier in the <br/>
week. We went back to that box looking for it since it was the last <br/>
place we had been. Glad to know it was found by someone who knew what <br/>
it was. I've contacted you by email and she will be doing the same. She <br/>
has the log that goes with the stamp. It was a hitchhiker she has just <br/>
received in a postal. Thanks again!</div>
