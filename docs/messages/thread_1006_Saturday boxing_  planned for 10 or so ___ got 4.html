                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1617585668">Hi all ... I had some errands to do on Saturday, one of which <br/>
required me to be in Pawtucket, RI, so Anjabanja and I thought we'd <br/>
hit some letterboxes around the area.<br/>
<br/>
I thought we might go after a couple that were in MA along the way to <br/>
RI, but the morning errands took longer than expected and I needed to <br/>
get to Pawtucket by a certain time.<br/>
<br/>
We started by hunting the Small City letterbox in Central Falls.  <br/>
Could not find it.  Placer thinks it might be missing, but not <br/>
confirmed yet.<br/>
<br/>
We did pick up the Scuba Steve and Fox in the Box letterboxes in <br/>
Pawtucket.  Per the clues, the Scuba Steve box is hidden behind some <br/>
trees, but not very well hidden.  The logbook had been destroyed due <br/>
to wetness.  I can't imagine this box will survive long given it's <br/>
placement.  We e-mailed the placer to let them know the situation <br/>
with the logbook.<br/>
<br/>
We then headed to Lincoln Woods to get the Sports of Lincoln Woods <br/>
series, but I wasn't dressed for the hot weather, opting instead to <br/>
believe the weathermen who predicted the weather to be about 15 <br/>
degrees below what it actually was!  Rather than trounce around the <br/>
woods, we opted to come back another time.  Same goes for the <br/>
Butterfly Farm boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, we headed over to Max's Minute (found!) and on to East <br/>
Providence where we hunted for the East Bay Bike Path Letterbox by <br/>
Bill &amp; Craig and the East Bay Bike Path series II by donna.  We found <br/>
the first with no trouble, but could not locate any of the three <br/>
boxes in the series.  The placer confirmed that two of them were <br/>
recently found, but we may have had old clues.  As we printed what <br/>
was on the LbNA website, we asked them for the updated ones and may <br/>
try again the next time we are there.<br/>
<br/>
So, even though we hunted 8 actual boxes, we ended up with only 4.  <br/>
That's OK, there's plenty of days left!<br/>
<br/>
If interested you can read of our adventures for these boxes at our <br/>
website, <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~scott.e.hall/F.html." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://home.comcast.net/~scott.e.hall/F.html.</a>  These finds <br/>
are boxes #16 - 19 on the "Published Boxes Found" list.  There's some <br/>
brief commentary about the Slater Memorial Park, Charles I.D. Looff, <br/>
the East Bay Bike Path, the Squantum Association, and Brown <br/>
University as well.  This time, we've added a few pictures.  Enjoy!<br/>

Oh yeah, I've started carving a stamp for our first planned PLANT!  <br/>
If I'm lucky, I'll have it done by next weekend, and the box planted <br/>
shortly thereafter ... will let you all know!  P1 here we come!</div>
