                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1824959420">What a fabulous day!  Thanks to Chrissy for organizing this 2nd <br/>
sucessful event - unfortunately, Chrissy was under the weather and <br/>
could not attend.  Hope you're feeling better! A great BIG thanks to <br/>
Music Woman for taking charge, to Donutz for tirelessly (and <br/>
meticulously) stamping into ALL of our logbooks over and over and <br/>
over AGAIN (are your fingers thawed yet?), and to Flutterby and <br/>
FatCat for generously opening their home to ALL of us!  What an <br/>
awesome group of people from far and near, out there trudging in the <br/>
snowy trails of Lebanon on this cold Sunday... Thank you ALL!!<br/>
My toes are still cold, but my heart is warm, MayEve</div>

Hannah kept waking up and mumbling, "67 stamps!"<br/>
<br/>
To think that morning, I told her, "I bet we'll get at least ten stamps today!" <br/>
<br/>
Connecticut is a marvel.<br/>

Hope to see some of you at the 13 March event in Maine!<br/>
