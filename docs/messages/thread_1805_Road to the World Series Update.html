The Yankees HH was released at The Graduate LB in West Hartford by Rubaduc and was dropped off at Stacy's Dolphin LB.  This was its last known where abouts.<br/>
<br/>
The Red Sox HH was released at Stacy's Dolphin LB where it was picked up by Sadie &amp; Russ who apparently has taken it to a few different boxes and boxers and even ensured it being taken out of state.  So far looks like the Red Sox are in the lead. <br/>
