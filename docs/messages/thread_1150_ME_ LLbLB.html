<br/>
I found the new LLBLB box this morning, but I was saddened to see <br/>
Phyto's box has been taken off the clue listing. Is that box gone for <br/>
good, or will it be planted in a new location?<br/>

</span></blockquote>I'm not sure what you mean. I didn't have any box there.<br/>
Cock O'The Trail placed a mystery box - doh - giving it away now....<br/>
That was the issue.<br/>
Check Maine mystery boxes and you'll see what I mean.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not listing any more clues on the www from now on. Some boxes of mine have <br/>
been demolished in Bangor, and I fear for now that I best lay low - somebody is <br/>
being malicious and I'm not happy about it. So, if you want clues - you'd best give <br/>
me your mailing address off list.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
