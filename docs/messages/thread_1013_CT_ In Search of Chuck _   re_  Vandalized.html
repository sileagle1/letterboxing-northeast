                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1865656507">i think it is so sad when i hear of boxes being destroyed. i live in new<br/>
hampshire and out of the 51 boxes i have found only one was destroyed and or<br/>
missing. interesting to say that was at a university campus in virginia.<br/>
perhaps it is simply a matter of numbers. the more boxes out there the more<br/>
likely they are to be found if not hidden or rehidden well. kinda like cars,<br/>
the more the numbers increase so do careless drivers and therefore more<br/>
accidents. it seems the responsibility might be in who and how we teach <br/>
newbies" of which i am one. most people learn of this hobby through word of<br/>
mouth. it is important that we just not tell them but show them. go out with<br/>
them, have them experience the more finesse art of hiding and rehiding. <br/>
just a thought.<br/>

    Thanks for the support and encouragement!  I'm sure most of ouir <br/>
discouragement comes from the fact that we just don't really have the <br/>
time to go out and perform maintenence or replace carvings right <br/>
now.   Hopefully life will settle down in another month and we'll be <br/>
back on the upswing. We've promised several folks carvings and we <br/>
know that we better get those done and hold up our end of the deal <br/>
first, then worry about existing boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

&gt;I also had a couple of boxes that went missing,and I also stress the importance of rehiding boxes carefully.I think that some people think that there helping the next letterboxer out by leaving alittle bit of the box showing,but remember a letterboxer has clues and will find the box,but if the wrong person finds the box they may just destroy it.I stopped putting papers in with my letterboxes telling all about this hobby because I,m afraid that they will go on the internet and have a field day,one box is bad enough,I don't want to tell them where they can find more.I understand that sometimes it's just a curious animal that digs a box out of it's hiding place,but if we all do are part in rehiding them better,the number of missing boxes will drop.Lenny/Kathy </span></blockquote></div>
