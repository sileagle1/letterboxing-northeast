                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1101655323">Hey all!<br/>
<br/>
Wow ... spent a whole day and evening in East Lyme this past Saturday<br/>
with Pointer Party and Brandy You're a Fine Girl.  I think this April<br/>
1 was "Letterboxing Fools Day" instead as that's what we were!<br/>
<br/>
Brandy and I started early -- 6:30 am -- at the Veterans Memorial Park<br/>
in Niantic, CT picking up Stump the Ump and Take Me Out to the<br/>
Ballgame.  We headed up the street to pick up Jay Drew's Save the<br/>
Hills (Laurel Tract) box as well before finding a place for breakfast<br/>
(the guy walking his dog said there were no diners around, so we ended<br/>
up at McD's only to find a diner about 1/4 mile up the road ... @#$%!).<br/>
<br/>
Pointer Party joined in at 8:00 when we all met at Rocky Neck State<br/>
Park (aka Dartmoor US) for a full day of scrambling to pick up as many<br/>
of the boxes in that park as possible without backtracking too much <br/>
Including mystery and word-of-mouth boxes that we knew of, we were<br/>
aware of over 50 boxes in the park covered on 20-some sets of clues! <br/>
A little hard to coordinate without backtracking, let me tell you!  I<br/>
had plotted most of the East Lyme boxes on my Gazeteer before-hand,<br/>
and Brandy plotted the boxes within Rocky Neck, so we had a general<br/>
idea where things where before we started.  Out-of-order was the call<br/>
of the day, especially for those large series such as<br/>
Woodland-Marshland-Water (8 boxes) and Denizens of Rocky Neck (14 boxes)!<br/>
<br/>
It was a pleasure to discover that all but a couple of the boxes were<br/>
there, in place, and in good shape.  There was one mystery box we<br/>
could not find, and we found the third box in the American Heart Walk<br/>
series missing.  Three Shells by the Seashore was a bit confusing as<br/>
well as we found one box in a location that was not in the clues, and<br/>
an unrelated box (with no name or placer information) in a spot where<br/>
one of the Three Shells boxes was supposed to go!  Thus, we all have<br/>
the "Unknown" box by the "Unknown" placer ticking up our F-count by one!<br/>
<br/>
After having a letterboxer's picnic there at the park we decided that<br/>
after 5 hours or so we were getting bored with Rocky Neck so we headed<br/>
out to pick up a couple other boxes in the area -- and ended up<br/>
spending nearly 2 hours hunting for a single mystery box that we had<br/>
cracked over lunch (kudos to Brandy and Mike from the Pointer Party<br/>
for figuring out the clues!!)  We needed a little push to get us over<br/>
the final hump, but we got it!  Which box was it you say?  We'll never<br/>
tell!!!!  :-P<br/>
<br/>
As darkness was falling we found ourselves at the Book Barn -- a very<br/>
interesting and odd sort of book store on Route 156 -- and a must stop<br/>
for anyone driving through the area (letterboxers included -- there<br/>
are 4 published boxes there!)<br/>
<br/>
Pointer Party headed home, but Brandy and I weren't quite done yet --<br/>
so back to Rocky Neck we went!  Sneaking in through the hiker's<br/>
parking lot (technically tresspassing as it was after dark!) we picked<br/>
up a few more of the Denizens series, Wanda and Pete's Two Cats and<br/>
some others before finally calling it a day at about 9:00 that night<br/>
-- 14½ hours after we first started!<br/>
<br/>
It wasn't really a 'boxing marathon as we need much endurance for the<br/>
jaunt -- we barely left the 2 sq. miles of Rocky Neck!<br/>
<br/>
When all was said and done, between published boxes, mysteries, a<br/>
couple of word-of-mouths and hitchhikers, 54 boxes was my count -- a<br/>
new single day record outside of an event!<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to hit that F1000 sooner than I think!<br/>
<br/>
I think we left about 16 or so boxes behind in Rocky Neck, so we'll<br/>
have to head back there another time, but probably not the day we head<br/>
to Hartman Park in nearby Lyme -- which claims 50 or so boxes on its<br/>
own.  Geez, two mini-Dartmoors right near each other!   I'm going to<br/>
wear out my new hiking boots quickly!<br/>
<br/>
The following is the list of boxes found in good condition on our<br/>
hunt.  It represents only some of the boxes found that day (no<br/>
mystery, WOM or bonus boxes are listed here):<br/>
<br/>
* C&amp;H's Stump the Ump (aka The Umpire)<br/>
* McDuck's Take Me Out to the Ballgame<br/>
* Drew Clan's East Lyme Land Conservation Trust Series - Laurel Hill<br/>
Tract (aka Save the Hills)<br/>
* Wanderlust's American Heart Walk Series - Boxes #1 and #2 (#3 was no<br/>
where to be found)<br/>
* Music Woman's Dolphin in the River<br/>
* Lauralei's Denizens of Rocky Neck Series:<br/>
    * The Seagull (box 1)<br/>
    * Horseshoe Crab (box 2)<br/>
    * Ribbed Mussel (box 3)<br/>
    * The Frog (box 4)<br/>
    * The Skunk (box 5)<br/>
    * Snowy Egret (box 9)<br/>
    * The Squireel (box 10)<br/>
    * The Fox (box 11)<br/>
    * The Osprey (box 12)<br/>
    * The Most Precious Citizens of Rocky Neck (box 14)<br/>
    * (note: we did not hunt boxes 6 - 8 or 13)<br/>
* Lulu's Three Shells by the Seashore Series (This series needs some<br/>
maintenance as things are out of place.  The placer has been notified.)<br/>
* Sadie &amp; Russ' Think Right<br/>
* Music Woman's Happy 75th Birthday Butterfly<br/>
* Butterfly's Tree Tor<br/>
* Karen's Red Dragon (This box is in place, even though the website<br/>
says it is missing.  We found it in a location other than what the<br/>
clues said and did our best to replant it where it should have been. <br/>
The placer has been notified.)<br/>
* Butterfly's Marshland-Woodland-Water Series:<br/>
    * Rocky Neck (box 1)<br/>
    * The Damsel (box 2)<br/>
    * Fritillary (box 4)<br/>
    * (note: we did not hunt boxes 5 - 8)<br/>
* Columbian Bugs' Fruit of the Dune Series (first 2 boxes; the 3 was<br/>
listed as missing by the placer so we did not hunt for it)<br/>
* Gal Pals' Wind Beneath Her Wings<br/>
* Sewsobizzy's Relax and Read<br/>
* Sewsobizzy's Book Barn Series<br/>
* Pudding Beth's Boo Box<br/>
* AM/PM's Tea Party Series - Cream and Sugar (this is the only box in<br/>
this series we hunted)<br/>
* Wanda and Pete's Two Cats<br/>
* Swamp Yankee &amp; Sunshine's Butterfly's Hat<br/>
<br/>
We also found three hitchhikers:<br/>
* Fish or Man's Flying Disk (currently with me)<br/>
* Celtic Quinn's Fear Itself Hitchhiker Series - Felinophobia<br/>
(currently with me)<br/>
* Chunna's JLB Angel (currently with Brandy You're a Fine Girl)<br/>
