"Throughout life each of us endures both painful hardships and soaring<br/>
triumphs. Lessons are inherent in each experience if we will only listen. We<br/>
grow by remaining fully conscious of the gifts we are given. Our<br/>
responsibility to ourselves and the world is to seek out knowledge and act<br/>
on what we learn. We must breathe deeply, trust ourselves, be unashamed, and<br/>
gather strength from the lessons learned on our individual journeys to<br/>
become whole."<br/>
--Dana Tiger<br/>
<br/>
"A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong, gives it the superficial<br/>
appearance of being right, and raises at first a formidable outcry in<br/>
defense of custom... Time makes more converts than reason." -Thomas Paine<br/>
<br/>
"If a man is offered a fact which goes against his instincts, he will<br/>
scrutinize it closely, and unless the evidence is overwhelming, he will<br/>
refuse to believe it. If, on the other hand, he is offered something which<br/>
affords a reason for acting in accordance to his instincts, he will accept<br/>
it even on the slightest evidence. The origin of myths is explained in this<br/>
way." - Bertrand Russell<br/>
