We were unsuccessful when looking for Queen of Hearts,too.  I can't <br/>
help with the other two. We were on the quest for monsters Sat. and <br/>
Sunday, finding permanent boxes as well.  We logged over 10 miles and <br/>
found 63 boxes. That's a real boost to our "F" number which is now <br/>
very close to 1000. Letterboxing Rules!!!! Happy Boxing-Sunshine</div>
