<br/>
Since we aren't brave enough to face this frigid weather outside, we <br/>
have decided to do some indoor letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
We wanted to read the article on letterboxing that was in the Boston <br/>
Globe on December 28th, but the only place we can seem to find it on-<br/>
line wants to charge us $$.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows a link on-line to get to the article for free please <br/>
let me know.  If not, Amy will check it out in the real newspaper at <br/>
the library when she get back to school on Monday.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!<br/>
<br/>
