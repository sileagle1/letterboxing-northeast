                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2000546829">Last year we disorganizingly organized a mini-gathering at Montville <br/>
High School for the Relay fo Life (American Cancer Society benefit <br/>
event). This year the locale has changed to Norwich Free Academy. <br/>
We're considering breaking out the event stamp from last year and/or <br/>
carving a 2004 event stamp. Looking to find out if people are <br/>
interested in meeting up for this again.  Here's what we had last <br/>
year:<br/>
<br/>
Lots of friends, some exchanges, an event stamp, tons of HH, visits <br/>
by some rare travellers,several boxes in the surrounding town. <br/>
<br/>
This year:   The Relay starts at 2pm rather than 11am (long story but <br/>
its due to SAT scheduling).  We could certainly work something out <br/>
for say noon on the green in Norwich and have a little get together. <br/>
There's SEVERAL boxes close-by and I might be persuaded into placing <br/>
a couple day-of boxes in Mohegan Park if I can get some help with <br/>
carving.  <br/>
