just got back home tonight from the Groton/New London,<br/>
CT area myself.  We were down for a family reunion.  I<br/>
had brought my LBing backpack and some printed out<br/>
clues for the New London area but was so busy with<br/>
family visiting and beach time that I never had a<br/>
chance to do any boxing.  I was hoping to get to the<br/>
state park at Bluff Point, but it sounds like that<br/>
would have been a bust.  So sad....<br/>
