I was 'boxing at Brenton Point in Newport, RI on the 13 of July and while<br/>
passing the location of the Drew Family's "Fast Passage" letterbox (our<br/>
first-ever Find!) I decided to check on the box. I admit I was using faded<br/>
memories from nearly 5 years ago, but still...<br/>
<br/>
I found a box... just not what I expected. A "Letterbook" Letterbox. Just a<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1343556704">I can tell you that in the spring of 2008, I was at Brenton Point with my husband and another boxing partner looking for Skyscraper, and we walked past the location of Fast Passage and saw FP out and open on the stone wall. The box stamp was gone and there was another notebook thrown in with the logbook.The stamp was gone but we found it in the rubble behind the wall. That place has been so trashed. We went to put it back and found the "LetterBOOK" box in the place of Fast Passage. We stamped into the LetterBOOK box and remarked in some fashion that it really wasn't very cool to take over a spot already occupied by another letterbox. But really, who knows what the story is. We rehid FP very well where we remember finding it years ago and also hid the newer LetterBOOK in the wall and I contacted Jay via email, asking if he wanted me to do anything with his box seeing as it was now sharing a spot with an interloper. He asked me to take his box, which I did a week or two later. <br/>
<br/>
The next time I went down that way, to find Skyscaper and some caches, the LetterBOOK was out on top on the wall with one little rock on top. Sigh. I have no idea if some idiot pulls it out of hiding or if the creator of this box works or lives nearby and thinks this is the way to letterboxing is done. Anyway, this is not the same location as Skyscraper (which IIRC is a stamp of a kite)... that was near the tower. The tower and the turtle garden are probably hundreds of feet apart. <br/>
<br/>
This place, The Budlong Estate, known locally as "The Bells," has been a party spot and make-out place for decades. It also attracts ghost hunters, vandals, and lots of tourists. It's a minor miracle that any letterboxes survive there. Even though the state has taken over the property and erected a building on the southern part of it where the beautiful mansion once stood, the section where the Skyscaper is has the dilapidated remains of the stables and carriage house.  The logs in Jay's box are a mix of letterboxers' entries and messages back and forth between children who talk of this place as their fort, and entries from visitors who "just happen" to find the box. (Not too hard to find it left out on top of the wall!)<br/>
<br/>
I wonder who the owner of the LetterBOOK is and I wonder if this person works for the state park. I think they must keep an eye on it because it survives being left out in the open.<br/>

The second one was superceded by Music Woman a year or two after the original plant and the first one was recarved twice, replaced once by CSCM &amp; Rustypuff, and finally we let it just go to letterbox heaven.

<br/>
Just a quick reminder that Leaf-peeping and Letterboxing is scheduled for Saturday, October 17th at Dennis Hill State Park in Norfolk, CT. Please see Event Listing on AtlasQuest or contact us OFF-LIST for more details. There are currently over 50 trailnames (representing over 100 people) signed up, and there will be several day-only plants, as well as a few special travelling event tabletops there! It will happen rain or shine, as there is a large pavilion there, and we have no other available days to host it!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your attention!<br/>
