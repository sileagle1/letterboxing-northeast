                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-881357043">This is just a notice that we have moved our letterbox called "Playbill <br/>
Series #3  the Lion King" to a new location.  It was formerly up a <br/>
very steep hike on Monument Mountain in Great Barrington, MA.  Going up <br/>
to do spring-time maintenance was too much for the arthritic knees <br/>
carrying the  "Lady" of Lord &amp; Ladybug, so we have moved the box to a <br/>
somewhat lower locale on Monument Mountain.  Please be sure to get the <br/>
updated clues before setting out to find the Lion King. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Lord &amp; Ladybug</div>
