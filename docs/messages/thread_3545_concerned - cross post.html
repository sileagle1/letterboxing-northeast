hobby.<br/>
<br/>
With the seemingly recent influx of newbie boxers who stamp and go , <br/>
the respect for the basics (like rehiding, etc) seem to get lost in <br/>
the mad dash.....<br/>
<br/>
I guess all we can do is try to educate folks about etiquetts by <br/>
talking it up at gatherings, perhaps spending time boxing with new <br/>
folks so they can gain some insight....<br/>

line tho a letteboxer is the one that left the box out in the open to be<br/>
found. this box was originally hidden in a spot that there would be no<br/>
accidental finding, one had to be purposely searching.  <br/>
