  From CT-- BUT -- our good friend Lobsta just moved from our great boxing state up to VT. in the area of your box.  She is off on an extended trip .or I am sure she would answer right away and adopt your box .  If no one else steps up to help - either e mail me back  and I will ask her , or write to Lobsta straight .<br/>
