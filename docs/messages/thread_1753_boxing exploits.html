24 Dec. - Grandma's Letterbox - NK, RI - <br/>
               I do some work around the corner from this box's location and always thought it would make a great letterbox site!<br/>
             - Le Papillion Bleu Letterbox - PeaceDale, RI - a beautful quiet place.<br/>
 26 Dec. - Uprising Letterbox - Charlestown, RI - <br/>
              It was a bit cold that day but the walk was enjoyable. <br/>
             When you got into the sheltered areas the wind didn't blow so much.<br/>
             Feel Better Letterbox - Charlestown, RI - definitely felt bettter out of the wind!<br/>
While we were in the neighboorhood we looked for the Frosty Drew Letterbox, but no luck.<br/>
1 January 2005 - North-South Trail - The Trestle Letterbox - Coventry, RI -<br/>
               We were on our way home from Moosup CT (by road, not the bike path) and stopped to pick up this stamp - Great stamp, excellent work!<br/>
15 Jan - The Love Letterbox - Smithfield, RI (Georgiaville, RI)<br/>
            This day ended up being the tour of northern mill villages! This is a very beuatiful spot -especially in winter.<br/>
           - Otis Smith Farm Letterbox - Cumberland, RI -<br/>
             The Cumberland Land Trust - what a great trail for hiking!<br/>
           - Blackstone River North Letterbox - This is a great bike path - someday Dave and I are going to get bikes and see it from starts to finishes. the box needed some attention, but we have contacted the placer and have done what we could. It is open for visitors. The views along this stretch are well worth the visit.<br/>
         We also checked out a mystery box up in this neck of the woods.<br/>
