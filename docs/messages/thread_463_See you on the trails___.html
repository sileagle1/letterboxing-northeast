at going up to Rhode Island this coming week to visit my parents. <br/>
What they don't know is that I'm *really* going to hunt <br/>
boxes..staying with them is just a ruse! ;) I plan to be out hunting <br/>
all next week, weather permitting, so perhaps I'll see some of you <br/>
out and about. And once again, if anyone has any boxing suggestions <br/>
for ones I absolutely should find anywhere in Rhode Island, please <br/>
feel free to email me. <br/>

Have a great weekend :)<br/>

If so, you can always letterbox in the Jamestown or West Warwick libraries (shameless plug!).  HOWEVER - do try to make it to the Just Bass letterbox!  The stamp is just so gorgeous!  I wish I'd seen the Porgy stamp that used to go with it.  There's so many great LBs out there, I wish I knew where to start advising you.  Faces of Wickford is also very well carved, but I think the fourth one is still missing.  Anybody have an update?<br/>
