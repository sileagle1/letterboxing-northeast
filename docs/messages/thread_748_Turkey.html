18 out of the 21 My Favorite Musicals boxes.   When we<br/>
returned to our car, there was a wild turkey in the<br/>
middle of the road, first standing, then lying down. <br/>
Another car had stopped and we tried to shoo the<br/>
turkey off the road.  When I waved my hat at it, it<br/>
came at me and chased me around a bit.  He wouldn't<br/>
let up!  I thought it was going to fly at me at one<br/>
point.  Finally, a bicyclist got between it and me and<br/>
I escaped into the car.  I guess I'll let the wildlife<br/>
fend for themselves from now on.  ;-)  <br/>
