                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-368905614">Thanks to all the folks that attended the Maine 'Boxing by the Bay<br/>
Event in Belfast on Sunday, September 4th! We had a blast boxing by<br/>
the water and meeting all the new faces.<br/>
<br/>
Present and accounted for were the following attendees:<br/>
<br/>
Phyto &amp; Isosceles<br/>
Cameooooo<br/>
Nautilus &amp; Culex<br/>
Oceanwytch<br/>
Maine Kokopellian<br/>
AmyMisha (with Dog Walker)<br/>
Camera Obscura<br/>
Team Green Dragon<br/>
The Engraver<br/>
Corinna (D'oh! she also forgot her stamp)<br/>
Patriotic Girl and Mr. Peanut<br/>
The End and The Cat Meow<br/>
Cooties<br/>
Limur &amp; Sangfroid<br/>
Country Boy and City Girl<br/>
Norasta and Guitarzan<br/>
F.O.O.L. (Fraternal Order of the Lizard)<br/>
Dr. Hawley Griffin<br/>
Old Hounder &amp; Siamese<br/>
Mary and Dan Safari Man<br/>
Uneksia<br/>
MsDragonfli<br/>
Keltic Kara<br/>
Mac and Beedle<br/>
The Spooky Group<br/>
Cody B Cleo and Rubaduc<br/>
<br/>
We know that the gas prices were through the roof, and several groups<br/>
also sustained some car trouble, but we were thrilled to see everyone<br/>
again and also for the first time. I hope everyone enjoyed the long<br/>
weekend, the boxing by the water, the event clues and Windjammer clues<br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
Ringmaster Phineas Boch and Ringmistress Phyto collaborated to bring a<br/>
special event only appearance of Boch's Circus. These Circus themed<br/>
boxes were available as part of the Belfast Historical Society's<br/>
History Walking Tour. I hope that hiding the boxes as part of this<br/>
downtown walking map also gave folks a chance to enjoy some of the<br/>
rich history of Belfast. <br/>
<br/>
This brings me to my final word of thanks for Norasta and her husband<br/>
Guitarzan. These two trekked 9 hours from Kingston, Ontario for our<br/>
event. They also hid 3 boxes before the event and posted clues. As we<br/>
walked around after the event on Sunday to find some of your boxes, we<br/>
realized that the "I Love Lobster" box was hidden in a spot we didn't<br/>
even find on all of our adventures to Belfast. Thanks for placing some<br/>
fine downtown boxes for us to enjoy. What a treat after a gathering!<br/>
<br/>
To those that attempted "Ah La Noix!"...it is indeed missing...Cameooo<br/>
was the first to find this box, and luckily in time before it escaped.<br/>
It will be replaced at some point. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for making this one of the most enjoyable gatherings that<br/>
Phyto and Isosceles have ever attended!</div>

gathering. What a surprise to see "our mechcanic" arrive in a classy <br/>

to live :-)<br/>

<br/>
We went out last night after all was over and had twin lobsters (each) because you can't spend a weekend in Maine and have no lobster. It's a rule. So is gorging on candies and such at the gift shops. The Nut House has so many delicious fudge flavors.<br/>
<br/>
We spent a lot of time at The White House taking pictures and poked around so we never went to get the other boxes we had clues for in Camden and points south today.  We shopped for little things for family and and spoiled ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
I was so impressed with the whole circus theme that ran through the town ~ Boch's and Belfast worked beautifully together!  This was very clever.  We liked the pirate theme in the park, tho I'd probably never embarass myself by trying to talk like a pirate.  You two put so much thought into all this and made up some great treasure map clue sheets.  The work of Phyto and Isoceles and the co-conspirators is very much appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

Phyto and Isoceles put into the gathering. I also want to thank the super awesome Misha <br/>
for hanging out with Sean. He keeps talking about you! And I want to thank everyone for <br/>
keeping a smile on little Jake's face, esp. Oceanwytch who even offered a finger to chew <br/>
on. We weren't able to meet everyone (or  get all the stamps) but we had a great time <br/>
chatting and exchanging stamps. <br/>

the fun.  The treasure map and event clues were super - a lot of work,<br/>

was a nice change and gave me some ideas for our gathering in May.<br/>
It was a real treat meeting new boxers and we hope to see you again if<br/>
