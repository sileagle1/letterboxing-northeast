was such a big etiquette thing. Still, if this is your audience here at <br/>
LbNE, why bother posting on other lists at all?<br/>
<br/>
Recently, I think some of the "rules" and moderation "policies" have <br/>
only served to hurt good people who tried to help out with the <br/>
community listserve chores. These are friends that we all know, who <br/>
have fine intentions and who are providing a service, and who still got <br/>
nuked. And you may not realize who actually did the worst nuclear <br/>
flaming and damage, but it wasn't just the other members of the lists. <br/>
Think list "owners." Anyone who tells you stuff like "you're a jerk for <br/>
cross posting" or "you can't talk about THAT here on THIS list" is just <br/>
plain wrong, and anyone who tries to get moderators to be enforcers of <br/>
those stupid policies is no friend of his fellow moderators.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, as I recall, the folks who Went Purple Heart on you back <br/>
then live right here on good ol' LbNE as well...<br/>
<br/>
Post away, I say! Jay<br/>

Thank you Alan! It's good to know that someone appreciates our <br/>
efforts :) Although, I must say, moderation of this list isn't very <br/>
difficult as almost everybody here is respectful of one another.<br/>
<br/>
As far as cross-posting, I am not a big fan of it personally, but it is <br/>
not considered a no-no on this list. So, as Jay says - post away. It is <br/>
always good to hear from you, in any event. <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-441903920">In my most humble opinion: Most psychologically sound people don't have a problem with x-posting, and if it does irritate them for whatever reason, they have figured out how to use the delete key or ignore it. Normal people deal without making it a big freakin' issue _to everyone else_ who just wants to find out about all things letterboxing. But some posters apologize because they know there are snipers out there...  and who knows who will catch the bullet.  Will it be them who get a barrage, or some poor soul who makes a reply...<br/>
<br/>
I'll weigh in with, "It has its place, and it doesn't bother me, but I hate to cause anyone bad feelings if they feel they have been ambushed because they are part the thread that gets attacked because I x-posted it."<br/>
<br/>
It didn't used to be that way on LbNA.  It used to be a kinder, gentler place about, oh, 3 years or more ago, I'd guess.  Let's see...  I started reading on the cusp of 2000-2001... posting more 2002-2003...  started getting suckier...  hey, wait a minute...  &lt;s&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?  Did anyone get real cheesed before the splintering?  Did the groups splinter off more because of attitude or region or "specialty"?  Enquiring minds want to know.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe not.  It's probably a door I don't want to get blamed for opening.<br/>
<br/>
Please don't change a thing, Alan, except maybe post more when life doesn't interfere with letterboxing.  You say you crosspost occasionally because you want to reach a wider LBing audience.  If your post could be of interest to even _one_  person reading a group, why should anyone get nuts that you posted to that group? It's not like you are selling Cialis. Others may totally disagree. I can't wait to read their reasons. If anyone goes purple on you, just keep repeating, "it's them, not me..."   or   "it's her fault, she encouraged me..." <br/>

Who only x-posted and apologized because it was NOT intended.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1783897730">Actually, I always post the apology 'cause back when I was <br/>
crossposting about our first WNY gathering, I got chewed out for it <br/>
by folks on and offlist. But really, it's become a necessity. On the <br/>
big board, my messages get lost in the fighting or, worse yet, don't <br/>
get seen because people like me are AVOIDING the fighting (and those <br/>
are the folks I WANT at our gatherings!).<br/>
<br/>
So, I basically crosspost any major Western NY boxing stuff (usually <br/>
gatherings and calls for donations) to the Great Lakes, the Mid-<br/>
Atlantic, the CNY, wth WNY and this board. We've had visitors from <br/>
all areas at our gatherings, so I know the bulk of you are within <br/>
driving distance (AND you don't fight!).<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, if I'm bugging anyone, I apologize, but I'm just hoping to <br/>
meet and greet new boxers to our area any way I can.<br/>
