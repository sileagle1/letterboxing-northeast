<br/>
We were intending on camping over Saturday night at the Wolf's Den <br/>
State Campground.  However, we've learned that you can't make <br/>
reservations -- only first-come, first-serve.  Has anyone else made <br/>
resrvations for this site?<br/>
<br/>
For those CT people, will we have an issue getting a site if we show <br/>
up on Sat. AM?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

</span></blockquote>We made reservations weeks ago at Wilderness Lake Campground.  It's <br/>
not far away from Mansfield at all.  We are getting there on Friday <br/>
morning and staying until Sunday night.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>
