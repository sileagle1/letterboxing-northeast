We are going to start with some fresh plants in and around our home neighborhood and then who knows?  <br/>
<br/>
Anybody thinking about a gathering this winter?  any themed placements going on ... we were discussing the Manchester Monster Mash from many years ago... it was a great time.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you on the trails<br/>
