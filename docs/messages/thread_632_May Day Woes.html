plans. My Daughter got her first lead roll in a production at the Warner <br/>
theater in Torrington and had to start rehearsals today. We still hit the trails <br/>
early Saturday and had a great day together. 19 boxes Saturday and 4 more today <br/>
before heading home. We camped in woodstock last night after hitting the <br/>
trails. I taught my Daughter to play poker, lost my money, and ate more S'mores <br/>
than I should have!<br/>
   The Personal event stamp will not go to waste. I will alter it slightly <br/>
and plant it as a box. I'm thinking it may the beginning of a series! Yes, <br/>
Nanepashemet was the answer to the clue.<br/>
    Sounds like the Gather was a good one. Safe trails to all!<br/>
