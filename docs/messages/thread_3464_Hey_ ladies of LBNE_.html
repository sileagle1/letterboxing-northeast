<br/>
I just got a flyer in the mail from Eastern Mountain Sports.  They're having <br/>
Women's Fight Night clinics where they have people there to help you find the <br/>
right fit for hiking shoes for your particular foot.  They're also giving away <br/>
free gifts!<br/>
<br/>
So here's what it says...<br/>
<br/>
If you attend the clinic, you get a free gift, but I think you need to RSVP <br/>
to your particular store to let them know you're coming.<br/>
<br/>
Schedule:  (all clinics are at 7 pm)<br/>
<br/>
Rochester, NY  391 Miracle Mile Drive  (585) 272-0090  May 1 <br/>
