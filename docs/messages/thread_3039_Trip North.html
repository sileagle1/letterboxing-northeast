Seems all the Quebec Letterboxes are way over by Montreal! Doesn't anyone else go to Quebec City and points east?<br/>

Mmm, not yet, though I think it's a beautiful city. We have no excuse<br/>
since we're more than halfway there in our spot of Maine. I hope you<br/>
too enjoy Quebec. Perhaps we'll venture up there later this summer.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1219325305">On our first trip to Quebec City after discovering Letterboxing we went searching for  "Pink Bullet", "Poutine" and "Stairs with a View". We found the right cannon for the Pink Bullet - but alas no box. We did find Poutine, but its stamp was missing. So we picked up a souvenir eraser in the city, Dave carved a replacement in our hotel room and we put it in the box on our way home. Stairs with a View is truly an urban microbox and requires stealth. I would definitely not go after it alone, though.<br/>
If we have a chance we'll check on those boxes to see if they are still there. All Quebec City boxes were planted by tourists, we haven't been able to convince our Quebecois friends that this is a neat hobby, yet. They sort of look at us funny. I don't know why. :)<br/>
