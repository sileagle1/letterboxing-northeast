They are now all cleaned up and back in place awaiting some new finders. They are EXCELLENT carves by RTRW. The clues have been changed a little bit to reflect the changes in the landscape over the past few years.<br/>
Also, the clues to the bonus box are now "FIRMLY" in place and hopefully will NOT go missing again.<br/>
