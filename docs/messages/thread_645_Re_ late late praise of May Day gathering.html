I am honored to have snagged an inprint of your well carved p.t.  <br/>
{even though I am anti-T.V.!!!!--forgive me, gotta take the <br/>
opportunity to get that message out yet again;-)} I just started a <br/>
whole anti-t.v. lecture but thought better of it and deleted it.  <br/>
Aren't you relieved to hear that? <br/>
   Seriously though, I dropped the ball when Pigtographer, Curious <br/>
Crane and Latte Man came slogging  back, all dripping wet, but stamp-<br/>
rich, to the pavilion. Caught up in chatting with other notable <br/>
recently arrived letterboxers I failed to seize the meager window of <br/>
opportunity to get an imprint of your stamp, along with the <br/>
illustrious companions you traveled with. <br/>
  There is always June, and July and August.<br/>
