Please let me know ASAP if you're intending to go to Lebanon for the second <br/>
winter drive.  :)  I haven'at gotten any RSVPs yet, and I'm anxiously awaiting <br/>
them.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Please don't email them to Mark.  He's not really involved in this one, since <br/>
he won't be able to attend.  Send them to <a href="mailto:davyschris@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">davyschris@...</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, and I hope to see lots of you there!<br/>

<br/>
I plan to go!  But I won't know definitely until Friday 2/25.  Life <br/>
gets busy with 3 kids and things sometimes come up at the last <br/>
minute.  I have a 12 passenger van that can be used as long as it is <br/>
good weather (it doesn't do well in snow). But the new transmission <br/>
we just put in it is doing well.<br/>
<br/>
