2 of mine.<br/>
<br/>
I visited Jay and Amy's "Happy Birthday, Baby! Letterbox" in <br/>
Walpole. Lovely stamp located among some impressive, grand beech <br/>
trees. I enjoyed the weather while sitting on the "foot" of the tree <br/>
to stamp in. Do be careful in searching for the right "crotch of the <br/>
tree" though - the first one I checked [not the correct one] was <br/>
full of beer bottle pieces. I tried to clean them all out, but I <br/>
can't guarantee there is no glass left. <br/>
I also added a bag around the box, as there was a little moisture in <br/>
the box - no damage to the book or stamp, but the stamp pad seemed a <br/>
little watery. You might want to use your own as I did.<br/>
<br/>
Next, spring weather having inspired my whimsy, I put a new stamp in <br/>
the Duct Tape and Whimsy box in Canton.  While there I saw <br/>
butterflies!<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I stopped at my Fly like an Eagle box in Canton. I TOOK <br/>
THIS HOME FOR MAINTENANCE - it will be returned soon. This park is <br/>
lovely in the spring and I saw more butterflies there.<br/>
<br/>
Can't believe that only one week ago I was trudging through snow to <br/>
do box maintenance! Hope this weather lasts!<br/>
