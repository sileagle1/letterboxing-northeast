Sweden box in their series, but sadly the log book was missing.  <br/>
Apparently Sojouner had found it earlier that day (8/21/05) and left a <br/>
piece of paper to log into since they too found no log book.  The stamp <br/>
and ink pad are there and the box is in the right location.   Strange!<br/>

discovered the same thing while visiting last week.  I left a small<br/>
notebook as a replacement.  Sorry the original is missing.  This is a<br/>
wonderful series and we thoroughly enjoyed searching for and finding<br/>
all 13.  The stamps are wonderful!  Glad Sweden's stamp wasn't<br/>
missing.  We also found boxes in Naples and Madrid while we were<br/>
"city hopping" in ME.<br/>
