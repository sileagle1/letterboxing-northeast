This is truly character building.....<br/>
In Portsmouth, NH.. Prospect Park-success; <br/>
Fort Constitution - failure.. got there too late (4pm) and it was <br/>
closed:(   Will have to try this one again on my way home Sun.<br/>
 Mackworth Island- I did this while it was snowing, such a peaceful <br/>
place -here was success!, well 2 out of 3 anyways. Phyto I love <br/>
finding your stamps! so wonderful:)  <br/>
In Brunswick ME, -Bay Bridge Landing, On the Commons and Life of <br/>
Ease... all failures...it was a bad morning.  Yarmouth Maine, Royal <br/>
River- success! South Portland Head Light- failure.. looked hard for <br/>
this one. <br/>
Well, I'm not done yet... heading out again tomorrow for more <br/>
success!  i hope&lt;---<br/>
I think I've got my sister and nephew hooked, so I'm working hard at <br/>
getting Maine to fill up with more letterboxers! <br/>
