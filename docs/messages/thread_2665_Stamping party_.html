<br/>
Are the any letterboxers that are local to the northeast MA area who want to get together to <br/>
work on stamping technique?   I convinced one of my letterboxing buddies to do a Stampin <br/>
up! party geared to letterboxers.  She will be talking about making journals, stamping <br/>
techniques (by making valentines) and inks rather then emphasizing stamps themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Stampin up is the equivalent to a Tupperware party but for rubber stamps.  They<br/>
have very cool ink pads and markers.  Their large ink pads have attached lids- which is great <br/>
when  letterboxing.  I have my eye on their pigment inks and markers.<br/>
<br/>
Please email me privately if you want more information on when and where.<br/>
<br/>
regards,<br/>
