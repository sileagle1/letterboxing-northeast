Saturday and Sunday from 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM. We thought we would <br/>
extend the invitation to all of our letterboxing friends and offer up <br/>
a "Tag Sale" letterbox in the process. I have been known to <br/>
have "Munchkins" and you never know who will be "Under The Table and <br/>
Dreaming". Moreover we can exchange personals including MT1's first <br/>
personal of Thomas The Tank Engine.<br/>
<br/>
We are selling all sorts of furniture including:<br/>
<br/>
1. Complete dark pine finish bedroom set (included, full bed, with <br/>
matress and boxspring, dressers with mirror, nightstand and dresser)<br/>
2. 3 piece light pine cocktail tables including a sofa table<br/>
3. Full futon with matress and cover<br/>
4. Dining room table and chairs<br/>
5. Patio table, and chairs<br/>
6. Giant brand bike<br/>
7. Computer items<br/>
8. storage containers (all types)<br/>
9. WEBBER grill<br/>
<br/>
These are the main items, but we will have lots of other items too.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to stop by, here are the directions:<br/>
<br/>
From New Haven:<br/>
Take 91 North<br/>
Get off exit 15<br/>
Take a left off the exit onto RT 68<br/>
At the third light, take left onto Leguis Rd<br/>
At end, take a right onto Grieb Rd<br/>
At third left, take the left onto Fieldstone farm BLVD.<br/>
At end, take left onto Broad Meadow Rd<br/>
We are the 4th house on the right, #24<br/>
<br/>
From Hartford,<br/>
Take 91 South<br/>
Get off exit 15<br/>
Take a right off the exit onto RT 68<br/>
At the third light, take left onto Leguis Rd<br/>
At end, take a right onto Grieb Rd<br/>
