doesn't surprise me that you found almost 200 boxes!  We had a hard time with just <br/>
Debby and I, and of course losing a full day due to a torrential downpour <br/>
didn't help either!<br/>
<br/>
I can't wait to see your pics!  I will also have my pics at the Monster Mash, <br/>
complete with stamps and hopefully narratives in the photo album.  I can't <br/>
wait to go back in June of 2005!  I'm already planning!<br/>
