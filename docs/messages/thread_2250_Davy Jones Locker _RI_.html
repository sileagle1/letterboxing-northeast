of the Monkees, so just wanted to pass this along.  Davy Jones of the <br/>
Monkees, along with several other bands, will be performing at the first <br/>
annual Misquamicut Music Festival at that state beach in Westerly, RI <br/>
tomorrow starting at 6PM.  (No admission charge)  So, letterboxers here's a <br/>
chance to get a letterbox, view a whale, hear music, see fireworks and spend <br/>
some time on the beach - all for free!<br/>
<br/>
Hope some of you get to enjoy this hot weather opportunity, or there is also <br/>
Shakespeare in the Park in downtown Westerly if that is more your "cup of <br/>
tea"!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

Kelli can all tell you that they've seen the photos of Davy and me together.  <br/>
;)  He is HOT.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I'm absolutely going to the concert tonight!  And I already have my <br/>
Westerly clues ready.  :)  Wish me luck.  I've never been to Rhode Island at all, <br/>
so I'm a little geographically challenged in that area.  ;)<br/>
