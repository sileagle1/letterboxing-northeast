conservation area I always carry a whistle.  It could be used to <br/>
summon help or ward off "nature buffs" if you know what I mean. I'm of <br/>
the rare Neanderthal species that doesn't carry a cell phone. The idea <br/>
of a whistle came up when a letterboxer ended up chest deep in mud <br/>
crossing what she thought was a dry lake bed.  Was that Leader of the <br/>
Pack or someone else?<br/>
