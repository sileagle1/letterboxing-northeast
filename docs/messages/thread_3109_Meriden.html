State: Connecticut<br/>
County: New Haven<br/>
Nearest city: Meriden<br/>
Number of boxes: 1<br/>
Location: Hubbard Park<br/>
Date hidden: September 29, 2002<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
From Interstate 691: Take Exit #4 (W. Main St.) south approx. 1/2 mile to <br/>
Hubbard Park. Enter park on left before pond. Travel around pond on entrance road <br/>
to rear parking lot across from swimming pool. Walk to swimming pool fence.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
Walk north to where ancient Dinosaurs once roamed.<br/>
Continue with the clock to a wooden rail pathway.<br/>
Follow the pathway to the 'old skating house'.<br/>
Look up!...a castle you'll see in the mountains.<br/>
Continue around the pond toward the park entrance road.<br/>
Follow the road a short distance until a side road appears on the left.<br/>
Take the side road to its dead end and a pathway awaits you.<br/>
Follow this main pathway into the woods.<br/>
Don't be lead astray by many small side paths along the way.<br/>
Stay on the main trail until you reach the 'mote bridge' (a metal walkway <br/>
crossing over the highway)<br/>
Pass through its 'yellow teeth' and cross the bridge.<br/>
At the bridge end, turn right and follow the path a short distance to the <br/>
'Dead Bug' (a pile of metal and rocks on the right...the metal was once a <br/>
Volkswagen 'bug'!)<br/>
From the 'Dead Bug' look up the trail to see a leaning tree.<br/>
Stay to the right and walk toward the leaning tree (about 60 paces).<br/>
Notice a large, upside down letter 'A' formed by a leaning tree and a two <br/>
sister tree.<br/>
Find a flat rock at the base of the leaning tree.<br/>
The Dead Bug Box is under this flat rock.<br/>
Enjoy the return trip and watch out for Dinosaurs!</div>
