We found a box in there today quite by accident.  It is a small hand-carving of a bed in an Icebreakers container.  No logbook.  Does anyone know what box this is or part of a series?<br/>

The set up at the reservoir has changed. There is only one parking lot you can access now. You can't drive all the way to the back but you can still walk. If any clues start with, "drive to the back lot", you can't do that anymore.<br/>
