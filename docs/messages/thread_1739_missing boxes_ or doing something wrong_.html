                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-471710213">There is no list of missing boxes that I know of.  Generally the <br/>
availability of the boxes depands on the placer or maintainer taking <br/>
care of them, replacing them when needed, or updating the clues to <br/>
reflect their current status.  Sometimes this doesn't happen <br/>
promptly, and there is no record of the box's status.  There is also <br/>
no list of placers who have lost interest in the hobby, and their <br/>
boxes go unmaintained.<br/>
<br/>
Often times searchers miss the boxes or have trouble following the <br/>
clues.  This happens to me on occasion.  I never use the <br/>
term "missing" for any box that is not mine.  I do report that I <br/>
was "unsuccessful in finding the box".  I would use the "contact the <br/>
placer" function on the clue page to alert them.  They may respond <br/>
if they know the status.<br/>
<br/>
You are wise to search for the box before bringing the young ones <br/>
out.  This avoids much dissapointment.  You can search the message <br/>
archives with the name of the box for any reports from others who <br/>
were "unsuccessful in finding the box".  Use the unlabeled space <br/>
next to the button labeled "search archive" on the "messages" page <br/>
of the talk list.<br/>
<br/>
The easiest thing is to look for another box in your area to find <br/>
one that is ready for visitors.<br/>
