recommend to the moderators here that they write him a nice note about how <br/>

There is no apology needed - you are truly the conscience of this group.<br/>
Hats of to you for recognizing and taking action on a potentially huge problem.<br/>
I, for one, appreciate what must have been a difficult decision on your part.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!! [And watch our kids - they're precious]<br/>

a certain level of moderation, common sense and R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y on the part of <br/>
parents, letterboxers (placers AND finders) is necessary in this instance.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Jay, there is *NO* need to apologize (IMHO) for having the wisdom and courage to post <br/>
and take care of this matter. I don't have kids (so blast me if I sound like I'm preaching), <br/>
but it could have potentially gotten out of hand in a very unpleasant manner. I hope <br/>
parents of children at that age are more cautious about allowing their children on the <br/>
world wide web.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

</span></blockquote>I have to admit, I was a bit surprised when I learned hikerlou was <br/>
13 years old.  Seems awfully young to be roaming around talk lists <br/>
unattended.  (Well, presumably without parental guidence.)  Where <br/>
are the parents in all this?<br/>
<br/>
But then I'd rather him roaming around on this relatively benign <br/>
board than somewhere else where there's more likely to be unsavory <br/>
characters roaming about.<br/>
<br/>
I'll happily delete any posts where Hikerlou is trying to meet up <br/>
with anyone.  A large, group gathering such as the one <br/>
TeamGreenDragon proposed I'm not so concerned about, but the "meet <br/>
me in the woods at such-and-such time" send goosebumps all over me.  <br/>
Most of us are probably exemplory, upstanding citizens, but it only <br/>
takes one bad egg to make such a meeting not worth it.  Meet in a <br/>
public place and make sure everyone (especially parents!) know who <br/>
and where you'll be meeting and have approved of such a meet!<br/>
<br/>
I'm not really inclined to ban Hikerlou completely, though.  The <br/>
talk list itself is a fairly safe place to chat online--it's only <br/>
when the online activities become offline activities will problems <br/>
potentially devolop, and maybe my mind lives in an idealistic world, <br/>
but I like to think we could educate him on how to avoid the dangers <br/>
of the offline world (primarily being, not going there in the first <br/>
place).  And I'd rather welcome Hikerlou into the letterboxing fold <br/>
than turn him away and have him find some other hobby to join that <br/>
may not be as caring or concerned about his well-being.<br/>
