the past little while:<br/>
<br/>
Peaks Island<br/>
Rings in Heaven<br/>
LLBLB (the Second)<br/>
Sunflower Ladybug (finally -- that's a busy spot!)<br/>
Seasonal LB (Summer)<br/>
Butterflies Are Free<br/>
<br/>
Also, we'd like to advise anyone seeking our Name Game box that the <br/>
trail maps have been having a hard time staying put!  The powers <br/>
that be assure me that they are aware of the problem and will <br/>
restock.  Just in case this disappearing act happens again, here's a <br/>
little secret:  There are two entrances, and maps seem to last <br/>
longer at the "other" one.  Good luck!<br/>

The Shalom winery was an interesting spot. This is a MOFGA (Maine<br/>
Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association) certified organic vineyard.<br/>
They sold us organic eggs and we even had a chance to meet the hens<br/>
and roosters up close and personal.  Phyto especially enjoyed the<br/>
compost pile. Do check out this box as a nice detour from the crowded<br/>
bustle of the miracle mile.<br/>
<br/>
Then we took another less traveled path and quietly enjoyed<br/>
Sangfroid's "Old Cemetery". Fantastic carve. Thank you for such a<br/>
wonderful box. A stop at the local Co-op for some tea and then onward<br/>
we pressed.<br/>
<br/>
The skies threatened so alas, the trip to further isles had to be<br/>
postponed. Bangor boxes called so homestar we went yet what is this?<br/>
To our alarm, it has totally been harmed! The box was nowhere in<br/>
sight, just the empty remains of a once happy nest. Farewell dear<br/>
homestar :(<br/>
<br/>
No finders at St. Franics. This is a hard one! <br/>
<br/>
******pleast note*******<br/>
The following Phyto boxes are not currently active:<br/>
<br/>
The Chocolate Church in Bath - pulled for repairs <br/>
Skyline - drenched by the past two months of soaking rains.<br/>
Spring Point - equally drenched. The stamp is fine. Needs a new log.<br/>
<br/>
To all those who have contacted me recently regarding requests for<br/>
various sundry clues, email is the best bet to reach me - and the best<br/>
mode of receiving clues will be your postal box. I'll need your<br/>
mailing address. I'm happy to mail clues, but I do not like them<br/>
passed electronically unless under special circumstances.<br/>

up around Lowell I think). Drive by's &amp; short walks along the 95 <br/>
area would be great, or within a couple miles of 95 (in case we get <br/>

If you know of any boxes not to miss in the York Beach area we will <br/>
be there for 2-3 days &amp; as long as it's not stiffling hot we'll <br/>
spend the days boxing. <br/>

Amesbury, Newburyport (slightly south on 95 but worth it!) and <br/>
Salisbury, MA. There are tons of great ones in Portland. Look up <br/>
Phyto and Casco Bay Painter to start (there are many others too)<br/>
