                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1297606755">Recently I posted a request for photo-clue websites, because I thought I had<br/>
located a letterbox site, but couldn't remember the clues.   So today in 0<br/>
degree wind chills, I headed to the site (dog in tow) and nosed around for a<br/>
bit.   Couldn't find anything and headed back to my car.   As I was heading<br/>
back (and trying desperately to keep the dog off the ice!), I realized where<br/>
I had seen the clue.  :-(    geocaching.com   Ugh!!!!!!    I passed what<br/>
looked like a bird's nest, with some plastic in it, but didn't want to<br/>
disturb a nest, so didn't investigate further.    Just went to GC.com and<br/>
found the clue, and a hint to "keep your head up."   So probably the nest<br/>
was fake and that was the cache.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had nosed around GC.com in an effort to not place boxes near caches, in<br/>
hopes of preventing people from messing with the boxes (as much as<br/>
possible).    So that's where I saw the clue.   Sigh.    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I did however, decide that it was a potential LB site, just need some<br/>
inspiration for the stamp for that area.  :-)<br/>

  Yes I planted another series.  After not planting a box in over a year thats six in the past week.  I planted these back on sunday but finally got a chance to put them up.  I have a six box series carved too but I need to find the time and place to plant it.  That will be up at some point.<br/>
