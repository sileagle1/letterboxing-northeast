My personal favorite is The Great American Stamp Store in Westport, <br/>
CT.  They have a nice selection of supplies and their prices are <br/>
very reasonable for pink stuff.  Not mention ... they have a <br/>
letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with all of you carving.  Safe Letterboxing- <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-984171980">Hi.  We made our personal stamps with the small white erasers, (2.5 x 1).   And I made a stamp for a box using the larger white eraser,  (1.5x3).  They were carved with an xacto knife and wood cutting tools.  Not masterpieces but we love them.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't catch what area you are from in CT but Kathy Johns in Storrs is a very fun spot to check out.  And the Lily Pad in downtown Willimantic has some supplies (white erasers, log books...)<br/>
<br/>
From what I've gathered, depending on what carving medium you use you may have to mount it on a piece of wood.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun, Fisher<br/>

  Can anyone suggest a place to buy the supplies needed to make our own stamp?  Have others used an eraser and if so, what type?  We are anxious to make one soon!!<br/>

I've also got the high-speed pink stuff, but for smaller stamps I'm just as happy keeping the costs of my hobbies down with a good ol' Dollar Store rectangle.  If they degrade or something, then I'll have another reason to carve more stamps!  Win-win!<br/>

www.stampeaz.com.  She (the owner) has great stuff &amp; great prices.  <br/>
But... I just went to her web site and see that she is going out of <br/>
business!!! I am sooooo sad.  I suggest you buy some supplies from <br/>
her soon if you are going to.  She sells sheets of carving material <br/>
called PZKUT for $5 which are great for carving.  The sheets are big <br/>
so you can get a lot of stamps out of one sheet.  She also sells lino <br/>
cutters which is what I use for carving. <br/>
<br/>
good luck!<br/>
