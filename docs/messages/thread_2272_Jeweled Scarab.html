I saw the spot and told Dan that it looked like a good place to put a box, but he said no, it didn't match any clues we had. I shrugged... told him I was too tired to go look just at that minute.  So he went and looked for me (he is a sweety that way) and said, "Wow! You were right! Lucky guess... but this isn't a Fear Faketor box!"<br/>
<br/>
The leaves were still dripping rain even tho the sun was poking thru and I was hurrying to avoid getting the pages wet, (in fact we had to stamp our log twice because one big fat rain drop fell on a nice clean impression and turned the scarab image into a blob), so I didn't write the creator's name. I thought I could remember it. HA!!!!!  Yeah, right. Anyway, we were the only ones to log in at that point, and I didn't see it listed on LbNA or AQ. I couldn't figure out if it was moved by someone or what.  So I figured I'd discuss it off list if it was just a WOM box or had been planted but not announced.<br/>

<br/>
I wanted to know if it was a missing box that someone had moved or part of an unpublished series or what.  We found it on a hunch, not with clues.  That really made my day!!  So many of the boxes had been removed already by the time we moseyed on out there..  it was nice to get one we were not looking for.  Many of the ones we sought we know we had the right places but no boxes.  Still, we know we found where they _had_ been, so we were not frustrated with our own seeking, just a bit disappointed in missing out on the images.  But what the hey...  we were late to the event and opted to take our slow, sweet time *just being* for most of the day on Sunday so we expected that we'd get to the boxes after they were pulled.<br/>
<br/>
I actually _did_ remember that it was by Scarab of the Doubtful Guests but didn't see it listed anywhere as one of their boxes, so I figured I had forgotten and had just remembered the beetle name, and was attibuting the box to someone who had not really made it. I didn't see the "Jeweled" variety listed as made by Scarab when I searched.  <br/>
<br/>
Did that make sense?  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
One of the boxes we found had only a stamp, no log (at the convergence) and at the next one I found a baggie on the ground with a note and images left for anyone that may have been seeking the box after the event. That was very thoughtful!  The bag was not hidden when we found it, tho, so I'm guessing some animal moved it.<br/>
