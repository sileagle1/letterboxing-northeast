Geocachers have been very very helpful to my letterbox placement <br/>
efforts.  I have 10 active boxes listed on LbNA and two of them would <br/>
not have been possible without the Geocachers.  <br/>
<br/>
I have friends and contacts in the Geocaching world - if you can send <br/>
me the name of the Geocache I can look into it.  If you don't have <br/>
the name;  perhaps I can identify it from the gps coords.  There are <br/>
about 70 Geocaches in Lakeville, MA.<br/>
<br/>
Exchanges are all logged in Geo-land - I may be able to recover the <br/>
stamp.<br/>
