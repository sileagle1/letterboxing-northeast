managed 21 finds and 4 exchanges in about 3 hours.  Unfortuately it <br/>
gets dark quickly now and that kept us from trekking much farther. <br/>
<br/>
We were amused to find out own hitchhiker in Shrek, we left it there <br/>
for some other lucky person to find! (Hint hint).<br/>
<br/>
We hope to come back up next week and continue the hunt.....and we'll <br/>
be using our newly re-vamped family stamp! Yay! <br/>

up with 40 (no that is NOT a misprint!) boxes!  5HH, 2 on-trail exchanges and <br/>
lots of walking.  Oh, and a bit of rain till we finished up.  It helps to have <br/>
extra hands and eyes when trying to keep 3 sets of clues going at one time.  I <br/>
wonder what the trails will be like this weekend??<br/>
