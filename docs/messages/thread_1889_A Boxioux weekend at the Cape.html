OLV mystery box-JFK mystery box-Flaming Dragons-Cape Cod Lifesavers-Spring Water-Jenkins Wildlife Sanctuary-Bill-Treasure Map at Great Island-The Great Island-Toy Box #1-Slinky-<br/>
Curses! Letterbox (great stamp!!)-Bass Hole Letterbox-Indian Grounds-Cranberry Letterbox-Think Snow Day-Winged Death's Head-The Empty Tomb. We also found the Skylark HH along the way and planted the Have Letterbox Will Travel HH.<br/>
We attempted to find the Silly Starfish but were unsuccessful and went to check on our box at Marconi Station but the road was blocked off. The park ranger we spoke to said the site would probably be accessible again at the end of March. <br/>
Thanks to all the talented carvers and planters who provided us with so much fun!<br/>
