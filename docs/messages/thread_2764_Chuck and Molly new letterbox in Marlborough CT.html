When Molly's ready to go out again so will I. Until then we sit home. This box was planted months ago but I just got around to writing the story that goes with the box. I have plenty of time on my hands during the weekends so I thought I'd get to work and finish it up. I hope you enjoy it and hopefully we'll be back on the trails again soon.....Chuck and Molly<br/>
