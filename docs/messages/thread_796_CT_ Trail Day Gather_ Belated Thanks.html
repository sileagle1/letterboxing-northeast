Danbury this past weekend!  Though I came fashionably late (and yes, I was <br/>
fashionable this time too... I was in an oriental shirt and pant ensemble due to <br/>
a school concert earlier in the day) and missed most of the activities, it <br/>
was great to camp with many great old friends and some new ones as well!  I <br/>
thoroughly enjoyed the many event stamps that came around the camp fire, along <br/>
with the letterboxing stories that came along with them!  The "Things That Go <br/>
Bump In The Night" series, that we did by head lamp, was awesome!  If I could be <br/>
assured that I wouldn't get arrested, I'd go night boxing more often!<br/>
<br/>
Also, surprisingly enough, it didn't rain much (finally started to pour, as <br/>
we sat around the camp fire, at about midnight, so we called it a day), only <br/>
raining during the night.  I'm almost thinking about doing some camping this <br/>
summer (for those who really know me, you know that I usually DON'T like to <br/>
camp!).  It was actually kind of fun!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Alan and EMS for a great day!<br/>
