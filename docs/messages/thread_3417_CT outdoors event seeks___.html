Message: <br/>
I am working on putting an event together called SummerFest 2007 at <br/>
Tarrywile Park in Danbury Connecticut on May 20, 2007<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this event is to introduce people to various outdoor <br/>
activities they can do over the summer<br/>
<br/>
So far we have bird watching, hiking, backpacking, camping, mountain <br/>
biking, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We are try to find someone who is willing to do a Letterboxing clinic <br/>
that day<br/>
<br/>
If there is anyone out there in Connecticut who is willing to help <br/>
out please have them contact me at GRASSRTS at HOTMAIL.COM<br/>
<br/>
Thanks&gt;&gt;&gt;</div>
