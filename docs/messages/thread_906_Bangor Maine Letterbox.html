Queen City Cache one which I think originally started with the Penobscot <br/>
Expedition letterbox. I have found most in the series but I am stuck on the last <br/>
one that has a clue that mentions 4 cannons. I tried contacting the placer but <br/>
haven't heard from him. Has anyone done this one?<br/>
