Note from Stamp Studio:<br/>
Just a brief update on where we stand. The Stamp Studio will continue its closing sale through the end of March and into April, as long as we still have merchandise to sell. There are still a lot of desirable items available. And at 50% off, you cant beat the prices! We still have a number of fixtures* available for sale as well. Its a great time to organize your home studio. <br/>
