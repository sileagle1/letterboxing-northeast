Laudholm Painterly Day at the Wells Reserve on Sunday. Kudos to<br/>
Oceanwytch and Maine Kokopellian who were the only ones able to find<br/>
us, get a one-day-only stamp and....clues to the "We be Jammin'"<br/>
series of boxes! <br/>
<br/>
On our way through the Southern Maine area, we checked on the original<br/>
Secret Garden box.<br/>
<a href="http://home.gwi.net/~moxie1/Clues/SecretGardenMystery.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://home.gwi.net/~moxie1/Clues/SecretGardenMystery.html</a><br/>
This box is still alive and secluded from the hustle and bustle of<br/>
busy summer tourists. A special bonus awaits those that visit this<br/>
oasis...<br/>
<br/>
Finally, on the way back home after a day of painting on the trail, we<br/>
checked on some seashore boxes. Glad to see some folks like Sadie and<br/>
Russ, Butterfly, Nautilus, Culex and others have managed to find these<br/>
little ocean jems. These are wonderful spots for a lazy summer drive<br/>
and seashore exploration.<br/>
<br/>
We also checked on "Higher Education"....in place since July 16th of<br/>
2003. Every summer since the placement of this box, Phyto has taught<br/>
the coastal marine ecology course at UNE. This box is in fantastic<br/>
shape and so many visitors from alumni at the University to locals... <br/>
<br/>
Hope to see some friendly faces in September!<br/>

make a sweep through Northwest Park in Windsor. We think we found all <br/>
the active boxes there (except for the box in the museum, which was <br/>
closed). Most were in good shape, though we did replace baggies in a <br/>
couple of boxes. Here's what we found:<br/>
<br/>
  * Inland Lobster<br/>
  * Celestial Orbs (2)<br/>
  * America's Pride<br/>
  * Slow Poke<br/>
  * Northwest Park<br/>
  * My Favorite Stinky Thing<br/>
  * Northwest Park Series (4)<br/>
  * Hooded Merganser (*excellent* stamp by Team Green Dragon!)<br/>
  * The Birds (7)<br/>
  * Perfect Sunday Afternoon (3)<br/>
<br/>
Earlier in the day, we logged The Gondoliers in Gilbert &amp; Sullivan #3 <br/>
in Simsbury (it was completely iced in when we found the rest of the <br/>
series in March, so we had to pay a second visit to the woods here). <br/>
We picked up The World's Stinkiest Hitchhiker and found two other <br/>
bonuses boxes, too, so I think we ended up with 26 finds for the day.<br/>
<br/>
Last Sunday, we made a sweep of Penwood State Park, and found all the <br/>
boxes in that park, too. With bonuses, we logged 19 in total for the day:<br/>
  * Circle of Lives (4)<br/>
  * Is It? (2)<br/>
  * Penwood State Park<br/>
  * Lake Louise<br/>
  * Measure Up<br/>
  * Whatt? &amp; Whoo?<br/>
  * Sneaky, Beaky &amp; Leaky<br/>
  * Valley Girls<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to rubaduc, rtrw and everyone else who planted boxes in these parks!<br/>
