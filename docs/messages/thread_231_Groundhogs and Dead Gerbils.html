"RIP Gerbil" from last year carved by JustBeth. As you may know, we <br/>
letterboxers need one dead rodent per year to celebrate!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I beg to differ but no mere groundhog could ever replace the RIP Gerbil! And <br/>
as much as I would like to take ALL the credit(because I'm shallow like <br/>
that) I need to point out that the RIP Gerbil was courtesy of Tempusfugitmd <br/>
and her husband Dead Duck Chuck who actually came from MD to attend that CT <br/>
gathering.<br/>
Mark, I'm glad you brought up the gathering because just this very week I <br/>
was thinking it's time to plan the 2nd annual RIP Gerbil gathering. May <br/>
seemed to work last year, let me know what you all think! Yes, the Groundhog <br/>
is welcomed to show his shadow at the gathering.<br/>
I of course will be bringing my famous "World Class Pizza" again!<br/>
