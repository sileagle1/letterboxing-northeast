                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1303394656">Yesterday, PSU fan and I went out in search of some letterboxes in the NW <br/>
corner of CT, starting in New Hartford.  We started out at the Nepaug series and <br/>
DEP boxes in Nepaug State Forest.  Box 1 of the Nepaug series has a cracked <br/>
top on both the box and the inkpad, and I'm surprised to see that no water was <br/>
in the box, especially after Ivan came through yesterday.  It does need a new <br/>
box though, and I'll e-mail the planter later on today.<br/>
<br/>
We then went over to Endless Inkspots and after huffing up the hill (I was <br/>
huffing, Peter wasn't....hmmmm), we found it with no problems and no water <br/>
inside.<br/>
<br/>
Brodie Park was another story.  We were able to find the box in short order, <br/>
however, it was totally soaked inside, both inside the box and inside the <br/>
stamp and ink pad ziplock.  We dried out things as best as we could, thankful that <br/>
the log, in its separate ziplock was not harmed.<br/>
<br/>
We then headed out to my favorite falls in NW CT and had a picnic near the <br/>
falls.  We couldn't picnic on the rocks by the falls since they were wet and <br/>
practically underwater!  The falls were so impregnated with water due to Ivan <br/>
that they overflowed the banks of that section of the river.  We decided to <br/>
picnic near the gorge and after a nap in the crisp afternoon air, found Waterfalls <br/>
12 six steps from where we picnicked!  Thankfully, the second river in the <br/>
area had not overflowed its banks and the box was fine!<br/>
<br/>
After we got so cold that we had to pack up for the day, we tried for the <br/>
Crawdad (again, since I tried with Butterfly and Bluebird earlier this year) in <br/>
Winsted, however, even on the second try, I still couldn't find it!  <br/>
Unfortunately, Peter wasn't able to help since he's extremely allergic to poison ivy!  <br/>
He stood on a large rock away from the forest floor and tried to direct me, but <br/>
no luck.  Hmmmmmm is it missing???????<br/>
Thanks to those who plant for a great day!<br/>
