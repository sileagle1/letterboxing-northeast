If you happen to find my HH in one of the boxes or can tell from any of the <br/>
logbooks who might've picked it up, please let me know. I'm recalling <br/>
Little Wings from active HH duty and would like to get it back.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Hiya! Rumor has it that Jeremy &amp; Greta (BOB is actually Jeremy's father <br/>
and was one of the original EMS letterboxers) are out of letterboxing <br/>
and have pulled down their clues. Too bad...Jeremy was the first in the <br/>
US to propose that way. Very romantic. I'll bet one or two of the <br/>
actual boxes might remain though, and I'll rumage around in some old <br/>
drawers and see if I still have the clues on paper.<br/>
<br/>
I think someone should hightail it out to Purgatory Chasm and plant <br/>
some new boxes, though. That place is special.<br/>

TurtleMcQ is right! There are old archived clues above...and below...<br/>
<br/>
The Proposal  <br/>
This is a beautiful scenic gorge nestled in the Blackstone River <br/>
Valley within central MA. It is common to see many people throughout <br/>
the year, no matter what the weather is. However, the chasm itself <br/>
may be closed due to either extreme wet or icy conditions. Be sure to <br/>
stop by their visitor's center and get a map of the area and trails, <br/>
and read a little history on the chasm.<br/>
<br/>
This series of boxes are inspired and dedicated to my future wife <br/>
Greta. For those with romance in mind might want to consider these <br/>
boxes as part of a romantic day or picnic. BTW, after checking these <br/>
boxes in June of 2001, we noticed many mosquitoes in the area, so be <br/>
prepared by bringing some bug-dope!!!<br/>

  The Proposal  <br/>
  This is a beautiful scenic gorge nestled in the Blackstone River <br/>
  Valley within central MA. It is common to see many people throughout <br/>
  the year, no matter what the weather is. However, the chasm itself <br/>
  may be closed due to either extreme wet or icy conditions. Be sure to <br/>
  stop by their visitor's center and get a map of the area and trails, <br/>
  and read a little history on the chasm.<br/>
<br/>
  This series of boxes are inspired and dedicated to my future wife <br/>
  Greta. For those with romance in mind might want to consider these <br/>
  boxes as part of a romantic day or picnic. BTW, after checking these <br/>
  boxes in June of 2001, we noticed many mosquitoes in the area, so be <br/>
  prepared by bringing some bug-dope!!!<br/>

I checked on the Purgatory Chasm Boxes last Nov. and found all but 1 Intimacy.  I found remains of the box but no stamp or journal.  Also the tree called for in two hearts has been cut down. Check at the bottom of the chasm for it's stump and a couple of large logs.<br/>

Tomorrow is the most important thing in life. Comes into us at midnight very clean. It's perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands. It hopes we've learned something from yesterday. <br/>

<br/>
I had adopted one of the "BOB" boxes - Bonsai - a few years ago.  I had <br/>
been doing maintenance on the box each season, and was a good adoptive <br/>
parent.<br/>
<br/>
When "BOB" pulled the clues from LbNA, s/he also pulled the boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Bonsai is no more.  Sure, you can get the clues, *somehow*, but the box <br/>
won't be there.<br/>
<br/>
Just an FYI for anyone who tries to go and find the clues, then the <br/>
boxes.  The boxes won't be there.  The boxes were pulled in December.<br/>
