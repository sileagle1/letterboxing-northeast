first aid items, including an ace bandage which I have yet to use-that's for <br/>
WIMPS!-even tho I'm prone to stepping into holes.  And my favorite camping TP <br/>
from WalMart in it's own little dispenser.  Can't leave home without it!<br/>

The most obscure clues that I've been carrying around for a few<br/>

we plan our trips according to the location<br/>
though I am first aid and cpr certified, I don't feel the necessity to<br/>
freak out about every outing. A day trip is one thing, camping and<br/>

kids, so life is much easier. I like it that way.<br/>
