Event Stamp.  I know that one stamp that he carved for the Moose Hill <br/>
Gathering got turned into the stamp for a mystery box.<br/>

Since the image for the NE Winter Gathering Event stamp is so closely <br/>
tied in with the location of the Gathering, I am thinking of the <br/>
suggestion that others have made about Carving off the date, and <br/>
placing it as an "undocumented feature" with the POE letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
But, it is not my decision.  Part of my wants to covet for myself and <br/>
take it home, part of me wants to let Brian do what he wishes, and <br/>
part of me wants it left at the site as a "oh, looky here!  what's <br/>
this?".<br/>

We'll see.<br/>
