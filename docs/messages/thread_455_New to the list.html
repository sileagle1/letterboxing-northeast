I am new to the list and thought that I should introduce myself.  My name is Frances.  I live in Tolland with my husband Jim and four children.  We went letterboxing last weekend for the first time and we are hooked!  We found the boxes in Tobiassen Forest in Tolland.  We brought some friends from RI with us and they are hooked as well and they have been telling lots of other people about our excursion.  What a great activity!  We are looking forward to finding all the boxes in CT, RI and MA!!<br/>

<br/>
Looks like you have set your sights very high to find all the boxes in<br/>
CT alone! But that's great. We love to see and hear from new<br/>
letterboxers as they come into the fold.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you soon and you may want to check out our special, 2 hour<br/>
letterbox! It might be a way to run into some letterboxers on the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

We hope you'll have at least half the blast we've been having!  Each trip we've taken since, for whatever reason, has had its fun magnified by the new hobby.  Do your friends from RI have a 'handle' (nickname) yet?  We chose 'von der Insel' like a family name, because it's German for 'from the Island' (Conanicut).<br/>

Our state holds the most letterboxes out of ANY other in the U.S. In some cases, more than two other states combined!! I applaude your enthusiasm though. Lots of luck.   --Northstar<br/>
