Not this time!<br/>
<br/>
A big thanks to Kreepi Kelly, Pointer Party, Brandy (you're a fine girl!) and all the great <br/>
organizer of this great event. It was nice to meet those who traveled from near and far and <br/>
to see old friends as well. I was especially grateful for not having to talk like a pirate all <br/>
day long. I would have just been growling Arrr... and shiver me timbers! Some of the <br/>
pirates in attendance were pretty darn authenic. I hope Team Safari's Captain Jack Sparrow <br/>
has gotten his depth perception back!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a fun time! Good job.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion</div>
