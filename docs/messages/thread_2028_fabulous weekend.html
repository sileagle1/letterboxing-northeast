<br/>
I was lucky enough to attend both the Spring Drive and the 2nd May Day Gathering.  I had an awesome time at both.  The weather was definately wet but that didn't matter when you are doing something you are "addicted to" with other great addicts.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to all the organizers, people behind the scenes and fellow boxers we met.<br/>
