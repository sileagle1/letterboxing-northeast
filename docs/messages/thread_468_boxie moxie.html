enjoyed a jaunt through the Wyeth world and admired Zorach's artwork. Thank you <br/>
Casco Bay Painter for a wonderful adventure.<br/>
<br/>
Then we attempted Martian Maggot's whaleback shell midden in Damariscotta, <br/>
however the kind DRA volunteer (Damariscotta River Associaton) was maintaining a <br/>
large portion of the landscape and we decided it would be better to leave well <br/>
enough alone on this matter. We'll come back for this box when it's warmer. They <br/>
plan on pruning the apple trees in the historic orchard and harvesting this fall. This <br/>
was very interesting as it hasn't been done in 30 or so years!<br/>
<br/>
After this short walk through the meadow, we felt like singing and enjoyed <br/>
AmyMisha's mystery. First finders on that one - and a lovely one at that! After this <br/>
attempt we couldn't leave without a wildflower walk and too bad we had to leave <br/>
our black cat moxie at home for "Chat Noir"...<br/>
<br/>
Finally a crazy heart drove us to madness as we stamped in at our last spot along <br/>
the way home. I've got to say that 4 new letterboxes in one day surely puts my <br/>
maine letterboxing over the top! Thanks to all the new planters.<br/>
