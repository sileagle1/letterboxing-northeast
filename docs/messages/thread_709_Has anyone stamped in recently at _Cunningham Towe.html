but could not find traces of the hints in "Cunningham Tower" (Mohawk <br/>
State Forest, Cornwall, CT, but not the DEP one).  I'm wondering if <br/>
recent construction with the cellular tower has disturbed it?  (is it <br/>
ok to ask these kinds of status questions?)<br/>
<br/>
We did the Bulls Bridge along the Housatonic river, and we also did <br/>
the nearby Claddagh up Pine Knob Loop, great exercise and great <br/>
lookout points up there!  It was great weather for boxing, we are <br/>
thouroughly enjoying ourselves, tho we are still a bit "wet behind <br/>
the compas". :-)<br/>

I also had trouble finding the landmarks in the clues.  I fould the <br/>
wire fence, but that was as far as I got.<br/>
<br/>
Yes it is OK to ask about the status of a box.  Just do not give <br/>
away any hints or information that is not in the clues to begin <br/>
with.  That would be a spoiler.<br/>
