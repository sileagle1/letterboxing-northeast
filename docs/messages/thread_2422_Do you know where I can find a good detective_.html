We didn't know what to expect and were told to expect the unexpected - that's just what we did!  All the detectives were wonderful and the planning was meticulous.  Thanks to all who planned and worked on this event!  You did a wonderful job!  No detail was forgotten.  The traffic control planning was terrific.  I can't say enough about this event!  Truly amazing!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and Enjoy!<br/>
