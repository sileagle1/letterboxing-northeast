brighter minds will figure out a way to stop the problem. In the <br/>
meantime, I agree that the best thing to do is to make clues to your <br/>
letterboxes disappear. From both websites. And if you have the time, to <br/>
remove your boxes from parks in southeastern CT at least, if not the <br/>
whole state.<br/>
<br/>
I think it's nice of some folks to think the best of others and hope <br/>
that this is just a new boxer that doesn't understand the basics, <br/>
but....no way.<br/>
