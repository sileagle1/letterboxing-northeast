<br/>
Just wanted to let you know that there is a new 9 box series starting from the Comstock Bridge in East Hampton, CT entitled "Petroglyph Series".  (in case you are not a member of the auto announce of newy planted boxes)  The clues are posted in New London County due to the fact that the bridge is out and can't be accessed from the East Hampton Comstock Bridge parking lot.  You need to go to Bridge Street in Colchester, which is on the other side of the bridge (and another county)  The hike is a total of 6 miles and there are 9 boxes with the logbook included in the last box.  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>
<br/>
