Chesterfield, Got there &amp; realized we left clue page #1 at home!!! It had directions <br/>
to box#1 &amp; beginning of #2. We had an hour round trip (w/ 5 little ones in <br/>
tow) home to get page 1 or try &amp; wing it &amp; manage #2 &amp; #3. Didn't want to loose <br/>
the momentum so we wing'd it. Funny as it was We found #1,with <br/>
out really trying (was a God thing for sure!!) #3 still elides us,  we will <br/>
try next week...but got #2. We had definately overdressed &amp; the extra <br/>
sweatshirts on the kids, tired them out, so with the vote 5-2 we went home for an Ice <br/>
cream.... <br/>
<br/>
