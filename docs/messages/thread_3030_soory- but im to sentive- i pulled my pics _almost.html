                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1905845018">i very seldom get involved in the nasty posts that come across on the main<br/>
list, and have very seldom seen nasty posts on the lbne list.  life is just<br/>
way too much stressful as it is without adding negativity to a much loved<br/>
hobby. <br/>
<br/>
on this case, however, i am speaking up. it is easy to read a post and take<br/>
what we want out of it, either blow it up in a harmful manner or a<br/>
constructive manner. why is it that it is assumed that one broke some kind<br/>
of rule when the end result was a fantastic picture? <br/>
<br/>
for the record skier is one hell of a photographer. you know those pictures<br/>
that you see on the new hampshire state parks brochures? chances are you are<br/>
looking at one of the scenes or wildlife captured by skier.  <br/>
<br/>
i for one think that the loon pictures are fantastic. <br/>
