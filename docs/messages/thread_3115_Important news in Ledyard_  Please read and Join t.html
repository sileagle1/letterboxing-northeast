A Walk In The Woods Can Help Ledyard <br/>
To The Editor Of The Day: <br/>
<br/>
This summer, there has been attention given to Al Gore's <br/>
documentary, "An Inconvenient Truth," which concerns looming <br/>
environmental catastrophes. Whether one is confronted by such <br/>
disturbing issues at the cinema or closer to home while perhaps <br/>
driving down a once-shady roadway now devoid of overhead canopies, <br/>
classic roadside stonewalls gone, and new construction as far as the <br/>
eye can see, I find it easier to deal with in "small doses." You've <br/>
heard the phrase: "Think globally, act locally." <br/>
Wish you could be involved in the growth of your community but don't <br/>
have time to commit to a municipal commission? Wish you really had a <br/>
voice and a chance to use it efficiently? Wish you could be at the <br/>
front end of the process, perhaps involving such things as local <br/>
land-use proposals, instead of hearing about them after the <br/>
decisions have been made? <br/>
<br/>
Take heart. Whether you cherish trees, prefer pavement or are a <br/>
consumer in need of clean drinking water, here is a chance to get <br/>
involved. Take a walk in Ledyard Â— free. Join the Inland Wetlands <br/>
Commission at 6 p.m. Aug 8 or the Planning Commission at 6:30 p.m. <br/>
Aug. 16. Meet at the end of Fawn Drive, off Whalehead Road. Once you <br/>
see and hear about this land-use proposal within the watershed of a <br/>
public water supply, you can forget about it or ask questions, voice <br/>
concerns, or sing the praises of the proposal at public hearings on <br/>
Aug. 15 and Aug 17. Discussions are encouraged and sometimes <br/>
decisions are made by those who show up.<br/>
<br/>
If you enjoy the process, you might want to continue to find ways to <br/>
participate in your community, become engaged in "realistic <br/>
remedies" and benefit the entire community. <br/>
