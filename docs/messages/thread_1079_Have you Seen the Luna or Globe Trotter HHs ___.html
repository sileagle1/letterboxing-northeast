gather and would like to know who picked it up or any other reports <br/>
of its travels. [She wants to know if we can plant a tracking device <br/>
on her next one...]<br/>

I had dropped off the Globe Trotter HH at the Moose Hill hostel and <br/>
would also enjoy a report of its whereabouts or where its been.<br/>
