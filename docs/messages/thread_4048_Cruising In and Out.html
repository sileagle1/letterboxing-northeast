<br/>
SAT Aug 15 (8AM-7PM) I'll be in Portland ME and SUN Aug 16 (7AM-6PM) Bar Harbor ME -- as the Royal Caribbean docks for each day.  <a href="http://www.quiltcampatsea.com/2009_CFAC_Pricing_and_other_info.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.quiltcampatsea.com/2009_CFAC_Pricing_and_other_info.htm</a> <br/>
<br/>
That will be followed up with THU Aug 20 (8AM-5PM) in Boston MA.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what each day will bring -- but I am prepping for Letterboxing  - printing clues and maps.  Will also have boxes to plant.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested in meeting up for an exchange before I hit the trails/sidewalks let me know.  I have a bus map for Portland so I may expand my distance in that city.  A mini meet for lunch would be delightful if someone knows a tasty locale on the way to a letter box.<br/>
<br/>
You can contact me off-line "sewsewbizzy at yahoo dot com" -- although I'll start checking back with this board also over the next 5 wks.  OMG I only have 5 wks to get it together!!<br/>
