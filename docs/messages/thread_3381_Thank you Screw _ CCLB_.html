have to send a huge "Thank you" out to Cape Cod Lightning Bug and<br/>
Archimedes' Screw for hosting this fantastic collection of boxes again<br/>
this year.<br/>
<br/>
The two of you are so thoughful for putting so much time and effort<br/>
into making this month-long project fun and enjoyable for others. You<br/>
were truly gracious hostesses to turn over your yard (and home!) so<br/>
that other people could enjoy something so unique and special.<br/>
<br/>
I feel so lucky and grateful to have two very generous and caring<br/>
individuals right here in my own "backyard".<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, thank you, thank you,<br/>
