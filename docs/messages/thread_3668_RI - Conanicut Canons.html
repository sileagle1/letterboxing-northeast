Yes this letterbox is back up and running - Dave and I decided to check out the spot that was usurped by a group of "well-meaning" young scouts with a psuedo Geo Cache, and Lo and Behold the spot was empty. It is no longer empty. This is the same stamp, same spot and same name with the same directions. We built a rock cave for the box. Please do not exchange the top rock for one of the heavier ones! That's what started all the trouble before. The old box got crushed. So happy hunting - by the way this box _is_ large enough to accomodate HH's.<br/>
