JUST REMEMBER!  If you're using Mastercarve.... put the iron on a medium setting (polyester/cotton, no steam).  I use a high setting no steam with P-Z Kut.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I'm working on carving my first two stamps, for my first two plants.<br/>
</span></blockquote>   When you carve stamps for your plants, do you stamp them in your<br/>
logbook, or somewhere else?   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is a great question that might also generate some conversation on<br/>
the newboxers list (hint, hint Mark!) but, I'm glad you brought it up<br/>
nontheless. When I first started carving, I didn't think ahead about<br/>
the images and where to put them not to mention what would happen if<br/>
the box/stamp went missing. I have learned my lesson ;) <br/>
<br/>
Since I carve all the stamps in the boxes I plant, I usually stamp the<br/>
image multiple times. I am not as meticulous as some folks (kudos to<br/>
TeamGreenDragon for their archiving) nor as willing to put the images<br/>
out for public property, but I do from time to time scan in the<br/>
logbook so that I have a record of the stamp image in case it 1) goes<br/>
missing - and I'd like to recarve a similar design or 2) I want to<br/>
distribute an electronic copy for the purpose of a finder stamp in<br/>
said instance when stamp is missing.<br/>
<br/>
On our clue pages, the boxes and stamps that are missing and/or no<br/>
longer active have posted images of the stamps. I'm reconsidering this<br/>
approach as our webpage is very inactive and nobody pays much<br/>
attention to boxes in Maine anymore, but anyhoo - I'd recommend that<br/>
you print yourself a clean copy of the image as often as you can<br/>
remember. Now that I've carved over 100 stamps, it has become<br/>
difficult to keep track of them and I often wish that I had begun<br/>
saving the images from the start.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure you'll find it enjoyable to look back on your images in the<br/>
same way that going through an old logbook brings back memories. For<br/>
some examples of how letterboxers have used their electronic images<br/>
you can see Springchick's webpage and the DrewClan's for some teasers<br/>
of all the fantastic carvings that they're done over the years!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy planting,<br/>

I make lots of impressions for myself.  Sometimes I try for a little <br/>
artistry, by trying different colors, background paper, etc. I have a <br/>
little box of 2.5"x3.5" cards, with my carving examples stored inside.  <br/>
It gives me a little peace of mind before I send them off.  Oh, and I <br/>
definitely have a copy in my logbook. <br/>

</span></blockquote>I keep a seperate logbook just for carvings I've done. Included in it are the stamped image, <br/>
the name of the letterbox the stamp is in, and the date the box was placed. It seems to be an <br/>
easy and organized way for me to find  images of work I've done. <br/>
<br/>
On a side note, some people do care what boxes are planted in Maine, regardless of what <br/>
Phyto might think. Some people also find Phyto and Isocoles' website (and letterboxes) truly <br/>
inspirational. Maybe they just don't want to go find all the GOOD Maine boxes too quickly!! <br/>
