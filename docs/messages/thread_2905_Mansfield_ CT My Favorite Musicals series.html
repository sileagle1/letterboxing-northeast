l.b. (the first in series) is gone.  So is 7 Brides for 7 Brothers <br/>
(the one in sawed off tree covered with piece of wood right by trail). <br/>
Calamity Jane was visible from behind as the dead stump is falling <br/>
apart. I re-hid it as best I could.<br/>
  Both boxes were present a few weeks ago when while hiking I did a <br/>
check and made sure they were properly hidden.<br/>
  Please tell me they were pulled for repairs.<br/>
