I don't know if this sighting is associated with this guy, but there is no<br/>

If it's a wild cat, it's likely to be a bobcat, although it would be extremely unusual on the north shore area of MA. In MA they are usually sighted in the Berkshire mountains as a single animal needs an area of approx 6000 acres as a territory. They can take relatively large prey, but generally wouldn't bother with something the size of a human, even a small child.<br/>
<br/>
Lynx are native to extreme northern NH and VT and central to northern Maine (and Canada). If it was a lynx, it would be very far from where it is supposed to be.<br/>
<br/>
Another  possibility is the accidental or purposeful release of a big cat like an ocelot or margay or even a cougar that someone was keeping illegally. If someone was keeping a big cat in captivity and it became too much to handle, they may have dumped it. It has happened before.<br/>
<br/>
Mountain lions would be the size of a large dog, say a german shepard, have a very long tail and would have a buff/gray to rusty colored coat. Bobcat are slightly larger than a red fox, have a short 'bobbed' tail and have a buff colored, spotted coat.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, the sighting of any of those cats would be very special, and I am jealous!<br/>
