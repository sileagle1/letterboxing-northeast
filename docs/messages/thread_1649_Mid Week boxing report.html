new Oswegatchie Woods Letterboxes.  It was a nice little hike, but we<br/>
were kind of confused in the log books.  We got to the first one and<br/>
only saw Bluebird has logged in.  We got to the second one and<br/>
Butterfly and Lobsta Lady had stamped in to that one.  Did you guys<br/>
miss the first box or just not sign in?  Either way it was a nice<br/>
little hike, and kind of cool how they wanted you to stamp in your log<br/>
book.  Happy Hunting.<br/>
