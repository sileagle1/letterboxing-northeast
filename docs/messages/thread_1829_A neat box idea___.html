They come four to a pack for about $7.50 and are large enough to hold about 36 4x6 pictures. But they look big enough to hold a log book, stamp and small ink pad. They are made out of a clear plastic material. Looks like they may be great for PLB's, HH's for sure, and smaller LB's in the wild. They re NOT water tight, but would make a neat pocket to store things in. Just a thought!<br/>
