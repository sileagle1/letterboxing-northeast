lost I finally got all the monsters yesterday. When I went that <br/>
first day and saw the the amazing and creative boxes I was hooked <br/>
and knew I had to find them all. Yesterday I had about 20 left and <br/>
was determined to do them all. I was doing ok but knew I'd have to <br/>
hurry to finish. I was doing Wolf Rock after 5 and dusk was <br/>
appoaching when I got the brilliant idea to take a shortcut, don't <br/>
know where I ended up, there was serious beaver activity there, but <br/>
needless to say I had to backtrack and follow the directions out. <br/>
Now its 5:45 and I have 1 box left at white oak, don't want to do <br/>
the hour drive back for 1 box so I flew up there, the directions say <br/>
15 mins., I can do that before dark right. Found the box and could <br/>
barely read the book when I actually groaned when I found out I had <br/>
to find another with compass readings no less. Well I found the spot <br/>
took out my compass and can barely see but I think I found the right <br/>
tree and I'm walking around and around it but can't find any <br/>
opening. Go back and start over, must have read it wrong, nope <br/>
brings me to that same tree, well I did find it that time and <br/>
hurried out of the woods as it was getting really dark, I'm glad <br/>
there was a full moon, which probably explains my dumb behavior of <br/>
going in strange woods after dark to start with.<br/>
 I want to think everyone involved for the great times I had with <br/>
all these monsters this past month, it was really alot of fun. Now <br/>
if the Red Sox win the world series, the month will really be <br/>
perfect. Chuck get ready to retire that box, just wish I could have <br/>
gotten it first, no I'm not going back to Ct today. <br/>
 Thanks Guys, Prairie Girl</div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-705479533">Today I found my last four monsters at Shelter Falls Park!  Woo Hoo!  All in <br/>
all, counting the boxes planted at the Monster Mash Gathering itself, I've <br/>
found 131 boxes (not including the box I planted)!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Chuck, Molly, Chickabirdie, Needeeps, Teach and Preach, Maplines <br/>
etc.... for all of your hard work!<br/>
<br/>
BTW... I found my box at the gather... was I supposed to count that as a find <br/>
or a plant????<br/>
