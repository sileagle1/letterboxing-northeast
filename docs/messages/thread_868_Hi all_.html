you have.  Simple and direct.  Hope to see lots of placed boxes <br/>

you'll like it here:) Unfortunately, I won't be able to attend the <br/>
gathering this weekend, actually have missed several gatherings <br/>
lately due to, yet another, scouting weekend. <br/>
This time I'm taking 12, co-ed, hormone-raging-can't-be-trusted-for-a <br/>
second, teenagers.. camping this weekend in the Poconos. For some <br/>
reason, their parents think I can handle this! ;0  This is my first <br/>
time overseeing a group of this "type". Should be quite an <br/>
experience. Anyways, I look forward to seeing everyone sometime soon <br/>
I hope:)  In fact TGD, I'll be in your neck of the woods.. so to <br/>
speak, in about a week. <br/>
Maybe we'll bump in to each other? ~big smile~ <br/>
ciao for now! ~waving~  K*<br/>

<br/>
Just dropping by to say hello, as I've been out of the loop for the <br/>
last month or so.  Was in Italy on business in November and extended <br/>
my stay for a nice little vacation.  Picked up one letterbox while I <br/>
was there, Amanda from Seattle's Bocca delle Verita.  Very nice!  My <br/>
first international letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, no letterboxing activity from me since late October.  <br/>
It looks like November is going to close with a PFX addition of 1!!<br/>
<br/>
Ah well, it's getting cold outside anyway.  Time to carve!<br/>
<br/>
Ok, well, best to all.<br/>
