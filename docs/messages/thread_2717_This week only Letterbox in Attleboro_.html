My Garden Club has entered an arrangement into the 10th Annual Flower <br/>
Show at the Attleboro Arts Museum and we have incorporated a letterbox <br/>
into our arrangement!!!<br/>

We would love for our fellow Letterboxers to come and find our Sohoanno <br/>
Letterbox (and vote for our arrangement - hee hee)!!<br/>
<br/>
I just posted the clues on www.letterboxing.org so check it out!<br/>
