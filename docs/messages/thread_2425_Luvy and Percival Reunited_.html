stamps were <br/>
amazing and the detectives, dead on. This was my daughter's and my<br/>
first gathering and it <br/>
exceeded all our expectations. Everything was so well organized. It's<br/>
clear that a lot of <br/>
creativity, work and energy went into planning the Pink Flamingo<br/>
Caper. Kudos to the Lazy <br/>
Letterboxer, the Letterboxing Ham and Mark and Sue. Also, we meet so<br/>
many nice people <br/>
as we crisscrossed our way around Leominster. Thanks for such a good<br/>
time!!!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion</div>
