I'm telling you.  I was completely impressed with how sweet the event <br/>
was and how well organized and well managed everything appeared to <br/>
be.  You made it look easy, and that is definitely saying <br/>
something... and to be greeted like we were old friends, even though <br/>
we'd never met before?  How can anyone compare to that??<br/>
<br/>
You and Oceanwytch are a class act, and the others? the others who's <br/>
names I did not catch? Were FABULOUS.  Every single one.  I spoke to <br/>
so many people that day and had not a single negative experience.  I <br/>
haven't been around so many helpful people, in one place, in a long <br/>
while, lol.  <br/>
<br/>
Maine Letterboxers are a class act, and those folks "from away"?  <br/>
Were just as kind and hospitable as if they lived down the street. <br/>
<br/>
The Kudos gets tossed right back atcha kid.  I hope all my future <br/>
event experiences are as wonderful as this one was.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you MaineKokopellian, OceanWytch, and all the others who helped <br/>
manage this fantastic Fright Night Event.  <br/>
