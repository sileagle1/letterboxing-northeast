Checked on  <br/>
Molly Day Series .......box #3 is missing . <br/>
Town Crier          Ok<br/>
My Favorite Things .....just needs updated clues ( Thank YOu )<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
to date this crew has recarved 33 stamps,  checked up on 135 boxes in <br/>
Connecticut. Her boxes in Maine and New Hampshire will have reports <br/>
soon.<br/>
<br/>
As yo can see many boxes in the Mansfield area have been restored , if <br/>
you do not see a note in the clues then the box was there during Sept <br/>
and Oct 2005. I must add that the Kettle Hole series in which we just <br/>
recarved and replanted 7 missing boxes is located in a flood area . <br/>
Part of the road is closed ..the boat laucn area is <br/>
underwater .......I am guessing that some of those boxes are missing <br/>
again .........If anyone attempts this series please send repsorts to <br/>
the NOrth EAst list serv.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
thank you <br/>
