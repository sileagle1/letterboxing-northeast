I'm from the Midwest and am spending the holiday with my Daughter at <br/>
Providence RI.  She lives in Providence (near the new Shaws off <br/>
Atwells) but being that RI is small and near other locations.  I was <br/>
wondering if some of you might have some recomendations along these <br/>
lines:<br/>
A couple easy nearby for some first timers<br/>
So "aboslutely do not miss".<br/>
<br/>
Although I've been letterboxing less than a year, I do love to solve <br/>
puzzles, so having the boxes ahead of time will be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any info.<br/>
