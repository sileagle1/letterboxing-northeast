which is wonderful, but which also means we'll miss a fun visit by a <br/>
famous San Francisco Bay Area boxer to central Connecticut.<br/>
<br/>
PrincessLea is coming with her 9 year old, tentatively scheduled for <br/>
the weekend of August 14-15, and will be staying in the Farmington CT <br/>
area. She is really interested in some short hike letterboxing and in <br/>
meeting and exchanging with the local afficionados.<br/>
<br/>
Can any of our social directors set up something fun for her? Her <br/>
email and website addresses are:<br/>
