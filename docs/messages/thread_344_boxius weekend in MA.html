Exhausting, but fun.<br/>
<br/>
On Saturday, Camera Obscura and I found Team Green Dragon's Let It Be<br/>
series! It was a long walk, and rainy, but worth every second. Those stamps<br/>
are AMAZING! The Forest they are in is really lovely too.<br/>
<br/>
On Sunday we met Solor and Binx in Bolton. This was a lot of fun for me, as<br/>
I have never letterboxed with more than one other person, and much of the<br/>
time I am by myself. They are super cool and we chit chatted and swapped<br/>
gossip and stories all day. We also stopped at the Nashoba Winery, which was<br/>
fantastic! We found Gould Letterbox, Powder Hill House, and Welch Pond<br/>
Letterbox before I has to leave. I am definitely going back to that town.<br/>
Those boxes are fun.<br/>
<br/>
I am so happy that spring is on the way! It's was a gorgeous weekend, and<br/>
fun boxing!<br/>
