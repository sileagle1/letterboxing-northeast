Music Woman for posting the class info to this list.  I never would <br/>

wanted to do but didn't know how to carve.  My appreciation for <br/>

</span></blockquote>That's great to hear of a stamp carving class. I've thought about<br/>
talking with a local scrapbooking shop-owner about carving rubber<br/>
stamps, but she just doesn't seem interested. Folks around these parts<br/>
either are carving or just don't know about it. The owner of the<br/>
scrapbooking store does seem to be the *only* supplier of the pink<br/>
speedy stamp however...<br/>
<br/>
Kudos to you for taking the class - and I definitely agree, once<br/>
you've learned how to carve stamps, there's no turning back. I'll<br/>
never buy another commercially manufactured - "store bought" - stamp<br/>
again!! It gets better and better the more you carve with practice.<br/>
