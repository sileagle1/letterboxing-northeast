                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-696528159">What a great time we had at the Peace On Earth Gathering.  We were able to talk to some old friends, TeamGreenDragon, Mark and Sue Pepe, Music Women, Butterfly, Bluebird, Columbian Bugs, Pixie Pam, and the list can go on and on.  And we made alot of new friends.  We had a great time talking with Trail Turtle for awhile and Latte Man and that list can go on and on.  The girls had a great time with the animals and the gift shop.  Special thanks to the lady in the gift shop.  The girls just loved her.  <br/>
<br/>
Kudos to Warrior Women for putting this together (and all those that help out).  It was a pleasure to finally meet you.  Brain, GREAT Event Stamp.  I wished the stamps that I haved carved look 1/4 as good as yours.  <br/>
<br/>
Congradulations to everyone that ask us "How is Amy?" for our Personel Traveler.  <br/>
<br/>
We loved all the P.T. that we were able to figure out.  <br/>
<br/>
And a special thanks to Mamma Fox and Bold Bagle(OOPS I mean BALD Eagle) and The Maplines for letting us follow them and Bald  Eagle for buying the girls a stamp pouch sewing kit.   <br/>
<br/>
Thanks you again to everyone...Hope to see you all soon again.  <br/>
