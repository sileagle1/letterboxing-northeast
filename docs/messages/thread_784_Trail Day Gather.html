well marked trails.  We got 3 of the 4 park boxes (wimped out of <br/>
doing The Beacon) The weather man was wrong and the day turned out to <br/>
be wonderful! We have several new exchanges and met lots of newcomers <br/>
to our favorite pasttime- AHH!! the enthusiasm is positively <br/>
intoxicating!!! I received 2 phone calls from Hez at the campout <br/>
assuring me that they were having a ball and had gotten 5 "after <br/>
dark" boxes. DARN!! Wish we had stayed!! Oh well, next time :0)<br/>
We are now proud owners of a signed copy of Randy's book, too! YAY-- <br/>
