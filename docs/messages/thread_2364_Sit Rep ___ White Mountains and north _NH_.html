<br/>
Just came back from a long weekend camping in the White Mountains. <br/>
Temperatures got a little cold at night (into the 40s), but it was a<br/>
nice weekend none-the-less.<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping to do a bit more boxing than I did, but I was with<br/>
non-letterboxers and forewent some boxing in lieu of other things.  Ah<br/>
well, the mountians will certainly still be there and hopefully so<br/>
will the letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
What I did get follows.<br/>
<br/>
* Seal of Berlin (Wanda and Pete)<br/>
* The Flower Fairy (Letourneau Letterbox) -- this box was located on<br/>
private land.  It was nice to meet the people who ran the greenhouse<br/>
where the box was located.  They recognized me instantly as a<br/>
letterboxer and before our visit was up had sent me on my way with a<br/>
box full of tomatoes and peppers!<br/>
* Diana's Baths (Tweety and Mr. Coon) -- this box is all but ruined. <br/>
The logbook is soaked beyond repair, and the box itself is damaged and<br/>
in great need of replacement or repair.<br/>
* Diana's Bath Too (Mud Bowl Gang) -- met a new letterboxer on the<br/>
trail for this box (The Nicol Family).  They only had about 8 finds,<br/>
but looked to enjoy the hobby.  Welcome!<br/>
* Fall Foliage (tigquilt)<br/>
* Cathedral Ledge series (3) (JP) -- the view from the top of this<br/>
ledge is spectacular!<br/>
* Swan Ride (MaineKokopellian)<br/>
* Humpty Dumpty (Oceanwytch)<br/>
* Eastern Slopes Inn Riverwalk (Tweety and Mr. Coon) -- this logbook<br/>
is pretty full.<br/>
<br/>
I also went after Thompson Falls Wildcat, but couldn't find it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
