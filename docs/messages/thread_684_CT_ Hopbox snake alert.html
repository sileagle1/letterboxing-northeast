We went back in the winter to get the box when the little bugger would not be around.I hate them so bad. There is a DEP box in Colbalt that I need to get but the clues say there are rattlesnakes up there. I'll have to go on a rainy day so maybe they'll stay home.<br/>

Better you than me Swamp Yankee!!!!  I just give all snakes a wide berth!!!  <br/>
Speaking of snakes, it reminds me of when Darrin and I went out to Hampton to <br/>
find a couple of Chuck Straub airline boxes and found a copperhead on the <br/>
trail.  Since it was an unusually warm late fall day, the snake was very sluggish, <br/>
and probably wouldn't last the cold night, but Darrin couldn't resist poking <br/>
at it with a stick.  Made me VERY nervous!!!<br/>
