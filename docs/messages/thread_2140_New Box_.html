<br/>
I am proud to annouce that the Willard Clock letterbox, after being in<br/>
development for nearly 7 months, has finally been planted!!!<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to Choi who carved the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike my prior two plants, Red Horse and Mary's Lamb, Willard Clock<br/>
is not a mystery box.  It's located at the Willard House and Clock<br/>
Museum in North Grafton, MA.<br/>
<br/>
I am developing clues and will post them officially on my website (as<br/>
well as establish links on LbNA and Atlas Quest) on Monday.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, if anyone would be willing to test out the clues<br/>
prior to their publication (to make sure they are accurate in leading<br/>
you to the box), please e-mail me.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks!<br/>
