  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Hi All! Pink Panther from PA area. Just wanted to post that <br/>
  Greyhound <br/>
  &gt; RV Traveller and Pop-Pop the Sailor Man had to move camp sites <br/>
  and <br/>
  &gt; don't have WiFi right now. I know some in the area had been in <br/>
  touch <br/>
  &gt; with them in their journey in NE. (Thanks for the nice note about <br/>
  &gt; meeting them from some very nice boxers!) They have been having a <br/>
  blast <br/>
  &gt; boxing in the area and extended their stay!<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; If you do run into them, hug my mom for me for mother's day!<br/>

&gt;   Yes, I think we had lunch together at Knoebel's. That was fun! <br/>
They <br/>
&gt;   are in Brewster, MA now. Heading to Scussit Beach State Park (I <br/>
think <br/>
&gt;   that is the right spelling) tomorrow and then probably to <br/>
Freeport ME <br/>
&gt;   to visit LL Bean(head). Then I think to Everret PA and then I <br/>
think <br/>
&gt;   to Germantown OH. Of course they can change iternies when the <br/>
mood <br/>
&gt;   strikes....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Man, wish I was retired!<br/>

get around a bit! Where ever they park the bounder (rv) is home. <br/>
Virginia is one of their favorite places. Oldest grandkid lives there <br/>
and they love outerbanks and SC.<br/>

Remember that '80's antidrug commercial:<br/>

<br/>
My 21st century version:<br/>
"Do you know where your parents are?"<br/>

&gt; How funny! I've only been letterboxing for a few months, but those <br/>
two names<br/>
