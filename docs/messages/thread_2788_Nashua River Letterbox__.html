                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1663818031">Recently Oldpatterns and I found the Nashua River Letterbox in sad <br/>
shape. I've tried to locate the placer, Wes, through letterboxing.net <br/>
as that's the only placed he's listed.  Has anyone heard from him <br/>
lately? I also tried to contact daringdragonfly who was the last <br/>
person to log on and flag that she/he had found it.  I'm trying to <br/>
find out if and when the log book &amp; stamp disappeared as all that was <br/>
in the box was wet paper that people had used to stamp their info on. <br/>
Other than that the box was complete empty.<br/>
If you know how I can reach the placer, Wes, please adivse as if he <br/>
doesn't want it--I'd be happy to adopt it. It's in a great location <br/>
and very doggie accessible--on the grounds of an old Hound hunting <br/>
park of some sort.<br/>
Any advise would be much appreciated. Howling Wolf</div>
