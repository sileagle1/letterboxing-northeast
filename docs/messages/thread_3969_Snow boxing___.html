Suzanne, Jonah, and I joined Sparky Butterfly on a bracingly brisk <br/>
hike starting at the back lot of MDC Reservoir #6 (West <br/>
Harford/Bloomfield) this afternoon, and went 3-for-3 on boxes in <br/>
spite of ice and snow! What helped to make them accessible were stone <br/>
caves in two cases, and lots of pine needles/boughs in the other! The <br/>
snow at #6 was 3-4 inches of powdery stuff on top of ice on the main <br/>
trail - several XC ski tracks noted. Jonah rode in his sled for a <br/>
portion of the hike - a good strategy for wee ones. We suspect that <br/>
many of the other boxes at #6 (having now found all but 2 that we <br/>
know of) would also be accessible, given the conditions these three <br/>
were under.<br/>
<br/>
Advice for those still looking to box in the ice and snow (much of <br/>
this is old hat for most of you, but this is really our first winter <br/>
trying it):<br/>
<br/>
1. When choosing targets, look for clues that explicitly state the <br/>
box is hidden "in" something - a stump, a hole in a tree, a cave, <br/>
etc - less chance of finding a frozen box or damaging a box if you <br/>
have to dig.<br/>
<br/>
2. STAY WARM (or stay inside)!!!!!! We were only out for 90 minutes <br/>
at about 18 degrees F, and relatively protected by trees from the <br/>
wind; I'm not sure I would have wanted Jonah (let alone me or <br/>
Suzanne!) out there more than another 30 minutes, tops. I was sorry I <br/>
didn't bring any of those nifty hand-warmer packets sold just about <br/>
everywhere (saw them cheap at Bob's Stores in Simsbury today).<br/>
<br/>
3. Bring yellow-dyed water or a dog for hiding your tracks' real <br/>
boxing intentions - make yellow snow! (Or, where allowable, use the <br/>
real thing - not so good on the shores of a public water source, <br/>
though!)<br/>
<br/>
4. If you XC ski or snowshoe - bring 'em! (Just be careful when <br/>
counting paces or steps!) Consider sleds, too!<br/>
<br/>
5. If you haven't gone to MDC #6 in West Hartford (as opposed to its <br/>
well-populated neighbor on Rte 4), think about it, because there are <br/>
a decent number of well-placed, well-clued letterboxes there <br/>
(including a HH hostel)!<br/>
<br/>
Stay warm!!!!<br/>

The lowest temperature ever recorded in the Quad Cities was -28 (that goes  <br/>
back 130 years of records) we've already been coming close to that number with  <br/>
-25 but we are expecting to hit -27. <br/>
<br/>
The weather forecasters are all excited, "how many records are we going to  <br/>
break."<br/>
<br/>
Really, if we are at -25 whats another -3 or -4 degrees . . . let them have  <br/>
their fun.<br/>
<br/>
Temps for the weekend are going to be about 25 ABOVE zero . . . that's a 50  <br/>
degree temp change in just a couple of days! Its going to feel like  heaven.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, weatherman also mentioned that (as of 10pm) that we had gone 27 hours  <br/>
without getting above zero! <br/>
<br/>
I must say I'm jealous of Alaskans right now, apparently Anchorage was a  <br/>
balmy 40 degrees (above 0).<br/>

  Chilblain news -- I am doing fine.  In fact straight from the Doctor's office , I met Donutz and we went letterboxing on our snow shoes !  Takes a lot to get this old one down . <br/>
  I had made the mistake of wearing heavy socks but not necessarily wool .  Now , I am wearing two pairs of the lovely 'smart' wool  socks and am healing slowly but surely .  Wool being the name of the game .<br/>
  thanks for everyones best wishes.  I only wanted to teach about Chilblain , and did not mean to worry anyone. <br/>

  OMG thats terrible. What were you wearing on your feet? I've been<br/>
  using my 10 year old Sorel boots (good to 40 below) even just to put<br/>
  seed in the bird feeders. I hope your pain is already subsiding. <br/>
  Does soaking the tootsies in Epson salts help?<br/>

We are putting on our double WOOL socks to do a bit of snowshoeing ourselves <br/>
today...Finally, the temps are above zero..it's a balmy 22 here in Chicago....what the heck, we <br/>
might opt for only one pair of WOOL socks!  Thanks for the info on Chilblain!<br/>
