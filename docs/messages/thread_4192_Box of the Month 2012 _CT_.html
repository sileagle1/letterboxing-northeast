The beginning of each month should bring a new creation from another talented letterboxer from around the country. I hope you get a chance to find some of these. The final contribution to this ring (mine) will stay there permanently.<br/>

P.S. This month's is an incredibly detailed carve from Crazy 8'z of Indiana.<br/>
