New Britain needs a letterbox so here we go again.<br/>
This is an easy walk of about one half hour.<br/>
<br/>
From Stanley Street (Rt. 71) turn onto Eddy Glover Blvd. near the university. <br/>
At the first stop sign turn into Stanley Quarter Park and park along the road <br/>
as soon as you're able.<br/>
<br/>
As you turn into the park there's a large yellow block with a one way sign, <br/>
this is where you want to walk back to cross a stone bridge.<br/>
Over the bridge stay on the road to the left past a ball field and skate <br/>
board heaven. Take the dirt road to the left of these, crossing another stone <br/>
bridge. At the fork go left (or straight) on the road less traveled up a gradual <br/>
incline, ignoring all side trails, stay on this main path. At the top when you <br/>
can see a white house ahead of you, you will cross over a log on the trail (I<br/>
've had many notifications that this log is missing, but it used to be 105 <br/>
steps before the cement block at the end of the trail). Looking ahead to the right <br/>
is a two trunked tree with the perfect letterbox hole at it's base where <br/>
Stanley Quarter Carousel will (hopefully) spend some time.<br/>
After carefully rehiding, go back the way you came and when you get near the <br/>
first stone bridge take a moment on the "big peoples" swings near the pond.<br/>

<br/>
This hike may not be suitable for young kids and dogs due to the high amount <br/>
of broken glass and other hazards. Poison ivy is also fruitful on this trip. <br/>
Please wear long pants and be mindful of it!<br/>
<br/>
Stanley Quarter Park is on Stanley Street at the intersection of Eddy Glover <br/>
Boulevard.<br/>
<br/>
Walk towards the skate park and take the dirt trail to the left of the park. <br/>
Go straight over the stone bridge and when you have to make a choice, go <br/>
north. When you get to an open area with a hill up to your left, go left on the <br/>
overgrown path. As you go up, you may notice poles with wheels on them to your <br/>
left. That was the old ski tow for the old ski slope you are currently on. When <br/>
you get to the top, you will find the old parking area. Go SW through the <br/>
parking area to another trail. Find a two-sister tree on the right, with one <br/>
having a blue band on it. Find the Stanley Quarter Ski Slope Letterbox behind the <br/>
tree.<br/>
<br/>
Go back the way you came and go until you are at the bottom of the ski slope. <br/>
Go left onto the main trail. At the next intersection, go right over the <br/>
wooden bridge with metal rails. At the T, go left and just before the road, turn <br/>
right. As you go up the hill, go around, under or over (whichever way works for <br/>
you) the "X." Just after the X, take the left turn which takes you over the <br/>
road and to the concrete barriers. After the concrete barriers, take the first <br/>
right. Soon, you will come across some ruins to your right (does anyone know <br/>
exactly what this is?). Keep to the right at the jumble of trails. On your <br/>
right, notice the band of overgrown evergreens on the hill edge. These were <br/>
planted by the Stanley family to give them privacy. Soon on your left, you will come <br/>
to a second set of ruins. This is the old Stanley Mansion. Find the circle in <br/>
the ruins (poison ivy everywhere... and be careful in the ruins!). For those <br/>
of you who like trees (Butterfly didn't believe me when I told her), there's a <br/>
GINKO TREE just east of the NE side of the mansion wall! From the NE side of <br/>
the circle go eight steps at 300 degrees. The Stanley Mansion letterbox is in <br/>
the corner of the wall. PLEASE REHIDE VERY CAREFULLY!<br/>
<br/>
Go back to the road and turn left down the hill. You will notice the Stanley <br/>
Quarter Park entrance to your right, and just inside, your waiting car. Have <br/>
fun and be careful!</div>

This is wrong and let this be a warning that those boxes will go<br/>
missing if that ever happens.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents.<br/>

I get what you're saying, and I did notice recently that your clues aren't <br/>
online, because I was planing a weekend trip to Maine at one point last month.  <br/>
However, I would never post someone's clues that weren't already online.  The <br/>
ones I just posted were online for the whole world to see before the LBNA site <br/>
had its meltdown just days ago.  In fact, most of them are still on Atlas <br/>
Quest; you just have to click "cached" in order to access them.  They may <br/>
actually be safer here on LBNE, considering that the only people who would subscribe <br/>
to this group are letterboxers from this region, and not just finding the <br/>
website.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, not looking to start an argument.  Trust me, I understand that WOMs <br/>
and otherwise unpublished clues are sacred.  If it bothers the group, I'll just <br/>
privately email clues that I happen to have when people ask for them.  <br/>

boxes that had gone missing: The 4th box of The Castle of Scovell and the<br/>
3rd box of Ol' John Joseph's Railroad series. The clues for the Castle box<br/>
are the same and the stamp is also the same. The clues for the Railroad box<br/>
are a little different, with a new location and a new stamp. For those who<br/>
have done this series already, it would be considered a new find. The name<br/>
of the new box is The Engine, and the new clues are as follows starting with<br/>
"come to a stream with no bridge", instead it will read:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come to a bridge, which was newly constructed as an Eagle Scout project. Do<br/>
not cross the bridge. Look under it on the left side, and there you will<br/>
find your treasure.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I will be posting the new clues as soon as the site is up and running again.<br/>
For those who have done the Castle boxes, I hope you will return and get the<br/>
last piece of the castle. <br/>

Any questions, let me know. Thanks.<br/>
