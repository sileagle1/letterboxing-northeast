<br/>
  It is an amazing carving by Scarab of VA. You certainly don't want to miss this one. As with all of the others, there is a first finder prize included. <br/>
<br/>
  When this box is pulled on 9/22/08 it will be the end of the box of the month for this area. I will then put a permanent box (my contribution to this round robin) in its place.<br/>
