<br/>
Just thought I'd pass this on.<br/>
<br/>
Though I generally carve my own stamps, I needed something special <br/>
for a non-letterboxing project.I found a great ultra-cheap source on-<br/>
line for custom made rubber stamps.  It is Thai Rubber Stamps, or <br/>
www.thairubberstamp.com. Yes...it is in Thailand! <br/>
<br/>
I was hesitant at first, so sent my very simple designs to them as <br/>
*.jpeg files and they sent a proof and confirmed the price I came up <br/>
with on their website...a whopping, horrendous $6.70 total....and <br/>
that includes shipping of $1.00...from Thailand!<br/>
<br/>
I paid by credit card through their source, a legitimate bank in <br/>
Thailand (I checked on-line), received confirmation of payment both <br/>
through the bank and from the stamp company. Two weeks later, my <br/>
package arrived! <br/>
<br/>
They did a really nice job. These stamps are mostly text, 1" in <br/>
diameter, about 12 pt. Arial, with a tiny graphic. They stamp very <br/>
well and even come with a plastic handle. <br/>
<br/>
Note that I designed the stamp in MSPublisher so all the lines were <br/>
sharp and distinct. They cannot handle shading.  I'm not sure how <br/>
they would do with a drawing, but you could send a *.jpeg of it and <br/>
ask them to send you a proof and price quote. They can make stamps in <br/>
quite a few different sizes. They usually respond to emails within 24 <br/>
hours.<br/>
<br/>
So if you're into faux postage, or are not into carving your own <br/>
stamps and want something special, I think it may be worth the risk <br/>
for such a low price.<br/>
<br/>
One caveat to all of this is that I am truly concerned I am <br/>
supporting child labor by doing this..or putting American rubber <br/>
stamp makers out of business ;-). Unfortunately, there is no way of <br/>
knowing this. So...I guess my advice is to trust your conscience and <br/>
do what is right for you. <br/>
