Message: <br/>
Good day Sir or Madam, my name is Christopher, I work for the Brunswick Parks <br/>
and Recreational Department. The other day I came across what seems to be a <br/>
"muggled" letterbox in the trash at the entrance to the bike path on Water <br/>
Street in Brunswick, Maine. It contains a small wet notebook and some slips of <br/>
paper. I'd be happy to return it to whomever is responsible for this sort of <br/>
thing so that they may replace it or do with as they like. Feel free to contact <br/>
me at my e-mail address and I'll get back to you. I'll hold on to the box in the <br/>
meantime if you want it. Have a good one.<br/>
