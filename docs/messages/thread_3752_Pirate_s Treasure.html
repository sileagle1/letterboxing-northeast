called "Pirate's Treasure". Rather than planting a formal letterbox, <br/>
the map and clues were burned into a roll of leather. The plan was that <br/>
the clues would travel from one person to the other. I was curious if <br/>
anyone has found these clues (and the box). I was also curious who <br/>
might currently have the afor mentioned leather map as I know someone <br/>
that would really enjoy finding this box. I can be emailed at <br/>

<br/>
I hope this post finds all of the LBNE letterboxers in good health and <br/>
fine spirits.<br/>
<br/>
Safe Letterboxing!<br/>
