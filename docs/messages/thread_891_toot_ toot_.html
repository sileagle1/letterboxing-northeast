I'm back from my weekend and just wanted to share my excitement.<br/>
 I found a mapsurfer box:)! I never work too hard for any box, as <br/>
those who know me can attest, so imagine my shock to see that the <br/>
last finder in this box was 2002.. and total finders in five years <br/>
was 5! well, I had two friends with me, (first-timers) and they were <br/>
thrilled with the find. "Maybe" I'll try for another one of those <br/>
elusive treasures:)  See you on the trail! K*</div>

</span></blockquote>Isosceles and I found a box this weekend that also hasn't been seen in years and <br/>
non the worse for it. Another one of those boxes is a long forgotten pictoral clue - <br/>
the kind that you could just walk right by. Not a single visitor since 2002 - and we <br/>
were 3rd.....<br/>
<br/>
Yup, it's like that in Maine too. <br/>
<br/>
Good times,<br/>
