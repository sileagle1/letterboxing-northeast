The weather has been great for the first 2 days of our visit and it <br/>
looks good for most of the week.  If anyone else will be visiting Cape <br/>
Cod between now &amp; Sunday SEP 28, shoot us an email and perhaps we can <br/>
get together for some boxing and/or a meal.<br/>

it works both ways...  We were able to meet you too!<br/>

Many thanks to Mumma, she made it fun and easy! (it's always much <br/>
more enjoyable with a 'partner in crime')<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your Cape boxing... but I'm not sure if you will 'have' time <br/>
for dinner ....  so many boxes too little time :-)...<br/>
