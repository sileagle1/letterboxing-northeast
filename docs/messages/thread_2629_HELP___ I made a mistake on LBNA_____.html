  I made a mistake on LBNA and accedently deleted clues to 2 of my <br/>
series, and now I can't find the stinking originals that I had for <br/>
backup. So if anyone out there has the clue printed somewhere for Get <br/>
Ready to Quilt, and or 10-08-2005 could you please let me know. I <br/>
really would like the get ready to quilt because that is a good indoor <br/>
one for winter.<br/>
Thanx in advance to anyone that can help!!!<br/>
