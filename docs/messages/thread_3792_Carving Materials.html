know definitively that Jerry's Artarama in West Hartford always has carving<br/>

Michael's (at least Manchester) is once again carrying the pink stuff AND the crumbly stuff, and occasionally Joann's will have a few blocks of Mastercarve.  You can always order from Stampeaze online.  GREAT service, and VERY FAST delivery!  Carve On!  MayEve<br/>

&gt; &gt; Does anyone know anywhere to buy carving rubber?  We live in <br/>
Waterford<br/>
&gt; &gt; and the store near us went out of business.  We are willing to <br/>
travel<br/>
&gt; &gt; a bit, we will use the time to box in that area.<br/>

VERY small detail.  I know I am no where near taking full advantage of <br/>
what can be done with it.<br/>
<br/>
I think the white is comparable in texture to the "pink stuff".  I get <br/>
great image transfers on it.   That and the price make it my preferred <br/>
block right now.  I highly recommend at least trying it.  I would be <br/>
willing to use the pink stuff if I could buy it locally, but I can't, so <br/>
I "buy locally" from another letterboxer and shop at Stampeaz.<br/>
