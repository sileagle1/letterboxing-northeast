letterboxers had noted in the somewhat damp logbook. I had to throw <br/>
out the green inkpad.  Stamp is fine-those thick white erasers <br/>
Drewclan uses are practically indestructible. Like Pease l.b., this <br/>
box was planted in 3/2000 and also needs the same size box as what it <br/>
was in. I dried box as best I could (ice inside), double-bagged the <br/>
logbook and placed the whole box in a ziplock.<br/>
  There are a number of other boxes at this park (Camp Moween State <br/>
Park) on Cedar Lake. I ran out of time for seeking out Fritz's l.B., <br/>
Special Moments of Recreational Delight l.b. and the A' Boxing We <br/>
Will Go series. Perhaps I'll get back there soon and can fix up <br/>
Granny's Tav. l.b.<br/>
