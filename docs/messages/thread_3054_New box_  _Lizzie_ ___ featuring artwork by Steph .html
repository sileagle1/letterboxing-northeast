"Lizzie", a theme box based on the infamous Borden murders in Fall<br/>
River, has been placed!  The box is located on the grounds of the<br/>
former Borden home (now a bed &amp; breakfast) at 92 Second Street in Fall<br/>
River, MA.  The owner was very gracious in allowing its placement, so<br/>
hunters please be respectful of this property's primary use.<br/>
<br/>
The stamp was carved by Steph of Pointer Party ... thanks Steph!!<br/>
<br/>
Clues to the box are on my website at<br/>

<br/>
Also ... be on the look-out for another box, "Purgatory", to be placed<br/>
next weekend.  This box will be located at Purgatory Chasm in Sutton,<br/>
MA and is placed in collaboration with SapphireBerry (host of the<br/>
Greek Myth Gathering for those who may not know her), who was<br/>
intending on placing a similar box and has generously offered to<br/>
combine efforts with me!<br/>
<br/>
A number of other boxes are in the works, including a series at Mount<br/>
Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge.  The first stamp of this series, carved<br/>
by Scarab, has been received and I am considering potentially placing<br/>
it as a single box while awaiting receipt of the other stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting!<br/>
