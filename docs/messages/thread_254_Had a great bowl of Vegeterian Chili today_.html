Bluebird and I all had a great bowl of Vegeterian Chili today.  We were the only ones <br/>
who were able to enjoy one so far and hope more people get to savor a great <br/>
bowl!<br/>

We also enjoyed some Rhododendrons which will be beautiful come June!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-110755209">The chili was indeed excellent!  Thanks to Judi and Linton for <br/>
leaving the recipe....which they've requested that I safeguard. I <br/>
guess family secrets can only be shared amongst a few folks at a <br/>
time....glad they took the time to share it with us.   I still think <br/>
its odd to add unsweetened chocolate to chili; but you know those <br/>
Kiwis do have a different touch to cooking! <br/>
