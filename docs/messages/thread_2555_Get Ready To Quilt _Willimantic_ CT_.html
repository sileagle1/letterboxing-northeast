recommend them.<br/>
This museum was so much fun. It is hands on-for everything!<br/>
The volunteers are all so wonderful and knowledgeable.<br/>
I was lucky enough to get to listen to a benefit concert when I was <br/>
there last weekend. It was great!<br/>
I spent two hours there just pouring through the local history and <br/>
could have easily spent two more!!!<br/>
Thanks Golden Girl for the great placement.<br/>
