Just because you can't draw doesn't mean that you can't turn anything into a stamp. <br/>
This includes a photograph in color or b&amp;w. You don't need a fancy computer <br/>
program or an art degree, in fact- microsoft word actually allows you to format a <br/>
picture now as well. You can just click on the image edit options and it will <br/>
transform it into either grayscale or black and white.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a good tutorial from Aisling on how to carve and some of the different <br/>
methods. <a href="http://www.aisling.net/lb/howto/lb-howto1.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.aisling.net/lb/howto/lb-howto1.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Once you've found an image, it is very easy to either transfer it from a printed piece <br/>
of paper (laser printer) using an iron or by copying over the lines in pencil and <br/>
doing a rubbing.  I haven't tried it with rubber, but citra-solve (a type of non-toxic <br/>
cleaner) works to transfer ink from paper to medium.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest just using a google "image" search on the web. You can usually <br/>
find black and white images of photos/people/places. As a suggestion, put a text <br/>
box around something or a border because even if it isn't your original art, you can <br/>
still add your own twist to something to make it unique.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck!<br/>
