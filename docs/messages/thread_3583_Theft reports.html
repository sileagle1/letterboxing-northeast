what is going on and ask that they keep thier eyes open.<br/>

I believe DEP has it's own police department.  They would handle <br/>
problems on DEP property.  Check with a park superintendent and they <br/>
can fill you in.  It would be easier if the superintendent could be <br/>
with you as you make the report.  It would answer some questions.<br/>
<br/>
UCONN has their own police department.  They would take care of the <br/>
Avery campus.<br/>
<br/>
Other locations would go to the town police.<br/>
