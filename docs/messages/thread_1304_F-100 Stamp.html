keep up on the "goings -on" in the area. But this is a special <br/>
message. <br/>
<br/>
I have just received the F-100 from Scoutdog and I have promised her <br/>
I will give those New England letterboxers on the waiting list a <br/>
chance to stamp in before I send it back to her to update the mailing <br/>
list. This way we can try cut down the list of names considerably.   <br/>
If you would rather wait.. it may easily be years before you see it!<br/>
<br/>
I am planning on being in Colchester, CT on Thursday, Sept. 23 all <br/>
day, until about 5pm. If there is anyone interested in crossing <br/>
paths, email me and I'll tell you where I'll be at 9AM, and then at <br/>
4PM. I believe I may also be in the area on Sunday the 26th.<br/>
I plan to do the same kind of thing the following week, in Eastern, <br/>
MA... but I'll be staying all night I think.  When I'm sure where <br/>
I'll be, I'll let you know;) <br/>
<br/>
I live in Western, MA.. if any folks needing the stamp are going to <br/>
be in the area during the next week or so, let me know and maybe I <br/>
can meet you.  Until then, safe trails... K*</div>
