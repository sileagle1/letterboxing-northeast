 it is not aisling that planted this box. it was one that belonged to<br/>
carolyn. i also watch over those boxes in the seacoast so everything else<br/>
stands. i believe it was pine tree that i was in contact with before about<br/>
carolyn's boxes? if it was can you send me an email about all of this? <br/>

We're so glad the Pegasus has surfaced! A nice piece of Seacoast<br/>
letterboxing history. We have boxes in the same park and know the area<br/>
well, but we've never been able to find the Golden Pegasus since the<br/>
trails and clue landmarks have changed so much. Uneksia, do you know<br/>
where the original hiding location was?<br/>
<br/>
So glad the Pegasus will soar again!<br/>

PS The Golden Pegasus was/is actually hidden in Portsmouth NH, not Rye<br/>
as listed in the original clues.<br/>
