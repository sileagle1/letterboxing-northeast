clues for a missing box were there for a short time and then<br/>
disappeared. We were sad that the box was gone, but didn't know who<br/>
had left it, so since there was nothing indicating that anyone was<br/>
replacing a box and a year had gone by, we thought we'd try (somewhat<br/>
unsuccessfully)to plant a box there since it's such a nice little spot<br/>
and we spent many hours there when our family was young. Don't worry,<br/>
the boxes will probably very quickly get eaten by the windmill of<br/>
death and the spot will be all yours.<br/>
