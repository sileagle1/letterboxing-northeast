                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1833908188">Finally, after five years of letterboxing, I've hit F100.  I hid my first boxes in 1998 and found my first one in 1999.  There weren't very <br/>
many to find the first few years, but my how things have changed!!!<br/>
<br/>
I hit F100 today at the Journey Into Imagination series in Shenipsit State Forest in CT.  Thanks for the recommendation, Kstar!  (Amy <br/>
and Jay, I would love to do your MA boxes soon, too.)  Unfortunately, there was a lot of shooting going on the whole time I was in the <br/>
forest, so I split after finding the first six or so boxes. The guns were getting on my nerves. Just after I found the Lorax and Goodnight <br/>
Moon boxes and returned to the main trail, I saw a dead deer lying right on the side of the road. Being a tree hugging, vegetarian kind <br/>
of person, I felt grossed out and uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a better (i.e., non-hunting) time of year to go there?  I wouldn't mind going back but not if I have to worry about becoming the <br/>
first letterboxer to be killed in action.<br/>
<br/>
After that I drove to the Ashley Reservation in Holyoke, MA, where I found one of the letterboxes there.  Lovely place.  The frozen <br/>
reservoir was so beautiful in the bright afternoon sun. I will go back!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who's contributed to this great hobby.  Good letterboxing to all in 2004!<br/>
