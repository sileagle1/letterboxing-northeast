Subject: [LbNE] Fall Planning...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As seen on AQ, we are organizing a letterboxing event at scenic Dennis <br/>
Hill State Park in Norfolk, CT, scheduled for Saturday, October 17th, <br/>
starting at 10 a.m. and going until whenever. The park closes at <br/>
sunset, and overnight camping is not allowed there. More details are <br/>
available on the event listing on Atlas Quest, but in short:<br/>
<br/>
The pavilion at the top of the hill has lots of room, picnic tables, a <br/>
working fireplace, and an amazing view, which will hopefully be near-<br/>
peak foliage color.<br/>
<br/>
There will be several plants on the trails at the park, some of which <br/>
may be event-only.<br/>
<br/>
Table boxes are welcome, and we are accepting raffle donations. Please <br/>
contact us if you are interested in planting trailside letterboxes, as <br/>
there are already a few in the works.<br/>
<br/>
No parking fee!<br/>
<br/>
Please bring a lunch or snack pot luck item to share.<br/>
<br/>
The park could serve as an excellent starting point for exploration of <br/>
other NW CT parks, forests, and (of course) letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
There will be a birthday cake honoring a few young (under 5 y.o.) <br/>
letterboxers with October birthdays, as well as age-appropriate themed <br/>
boxes, too.<br/>
<br/>
Hope some of you can make it!<br/>
