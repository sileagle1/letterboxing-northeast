gather last weekend such a great success!<br/>
<br/>
We went early and volunteered with the Trail Maintenance, the choices <br/>
were blazing, clearing a blow-down, or building a step-stone bridge <br/>
over an old pond spillway.... who wouldn't opt for playing in the <br/>
water?  Actually it mainly consisted of hauling rocks and dirt, but <br/>
many hands made for light work and  the Park people rewarded us with <br/>
a bag lunch and a free T-shirt (which came in handy to change into <br/>
after the bridge building!) <br/>
<br/>
At about noon we headed back to the Barn to see if other boxers had <br/>
arrived, and met a Koyote on the trail (did anyone else actually make <br/>
it to the beacon besides you guys?).   As our first event, not <br/>
knowing what to expect, we had a great time throughout the afternoon <br/>
exchanging stamps and talking with everyone, learning a million new <br/>
things.    <br/>
<br/>
I'd been transferring my laser-printed images via the acetone method <br/>
(nail polish remover) and hadn't tried the other 'heat' (using an <br/>
iron) method.  I just tried the heat method (on medium heat, keep it <br/>
moving over the paper) on my latest transfer on the pink speedball <br/>
and it worked awesomely, much less sticky and much better detail than <br/>
acetone!! so thank you Mapsurfer for recommending that!  <br/>
<br/>
I also tried plexiglass as a backing, which also worked great!  Alan <br/>
said that's what they use in Dartmoor.  Plexiglass is easy to cut to <br/>
size by scoring with a mat knife and snapping along the score mark.  <br/>
I have an old fashioned 'Corner Rounder' to round off the corners.  <br/>
When the carving was complete, I heat transfered a 'flipped' version <br/>
of the image on the back of the pink side and glued plexiglass over <br/>
it - worked great, and makes for a nice thin stamp to fit into boxes.<br/>
<br/>
So thanks again for the good times, new friends and great event <br/>
stamps (how many subtle donut hints did it take us!?!)<br/>

p.s. special thanks to the night boxing brigade behind us that <br/>
rescued us at that "right or left at the bridge" delima!</div>
