<br/>
A Christmas Carol: both boxes are great! Perhaps a bit damp. Loved the carvings! I got great impressions!<br/>
<br/>
Feeding the Geese: We found this one first and it hooked the girls! <br/>
<br/>
The Dancer: The stamp is cracked in half about 3/4 of the way, still connected at the bottom.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all the creators for a great afternoon!<br/>
