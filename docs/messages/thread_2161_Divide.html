  Subject: [LbNE] Divide<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I day that if you click MA from the big nationwide map you should get<br/>
  MA at that point, not the three southern NE states.  When you click<br/>
  Nebraska, Kansas doesn't come with it, so why do CT and RI come with<br/>
  MA (or any similar combination)?<br/>
<br/>
  As for dividing the state, you could break up by the Cape, but if you<br/>
  do, include the islands (Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard) with the Cape.<br/>
<br/>
  You could also divide by county (similar to most other states in the<br/>
  database)  Challenge with this is that counties are really used or<br/>
  known much here in New England.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Exactly!!  We don't have county governments, schools, or taxes, and the roads don't have county lines...  At least not in RI. The only thing we really ever use counties for around here is to divide up the court system, AFAIK, but it does help to organize our little state on the list.  <br/>
<br/>
Sub-division of CT and MA into areas first is a good thing, then divide by county.  <br/>
<br/>
CT's "Quiet Corner,"  "New London area," or Greater Hartford area mean more to me than any county name, but a general NE, SE, North Central, etc., kind of grouping works, too. That's why it's best to keep CT divided first by region, IMHO.  Same with Mass.  Anyone can pretty much point to "the Hub," "Whoostuh," "the Cape and the Islands," or "the Berkshires," but the county names mean next to nuthin' to the average person. I think I'm pretty average in that respect because I'm a native, not a transplant. Sure, if you go to listing by county, I'll probably find stuff if motivated but it's just not a New England way of thinking.  We live in a geographical state of mind, not counties.  I'll want to know _first_, "Is it near Boston or the Cape, or in the middle, or in the hills way out near NY?"<br/>

Whatever you do, Choi, will be just fine. But you did ask...<br/>
