spectacular series set in the majestic woods of Devil's Hopyard State <br/>
Park with varied terrain through a lush forest and one awesome view at <br/>
the top!! One repair note-- either box#5 or #9 had a cracked <br/>
container, I can't remember which one. My hat's off to the <br/>
Domedreamers!!! Hope to see you guys at Trails Day!<br/>

gorgeous,especially the trail they picked for this series,which I <br/>
hadnt been on before, and for that my thanks to the Domedreamers!I <br/>
