wonderful series!  There doesn't seem to be an email address for her <br/>
or a "contact placer" option.  I should have paid more attention in <br/>
the logbooks for her email address....<br/>
Erin, this is such a well thought out series - the theme, clues and <br/>
excellent stamps!  Thank you for your great work!<br/>
While on vacation recently phynstar and I was able to find the <br/>
Signpost, Mexico, Peru, Norway, Sweden and Paris (it took 2 attempts <br/>
for the last 2!)  Hopefully next year I'll search for more.<br/>
