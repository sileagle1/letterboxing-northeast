Saturday, June 10th from 10 am to 2 pm rain or shine. This celebration <br/>
of the upcoming solstice and summer fun will include event-only boxes <br/>
carved by local letterboxers, a temporary hitchhiker hostel, and a few <br/>
traveling event stamps as well.<br/>
You may bring a picnic lunch or purchase breakfast or lunch at the <br/>
restaurant which is open from 8am to 2 pm (be sure to save room for <br/>
delicious homemade desserts). This is a beautiful coastal area to <br/>
explore and the beach is directly across the street. Bring sunscreen to <br/>
protect against those sunny skies, warm clothes to take the chill off <br/>
the seabreeze, binoculars since you'll be in one of the best loved <br/>
birdwatching spots, and of course, ink and stamps for exchanging. Most <br/>
importantly, bring your friends and family so you can meet fellow <br/>
boxers, new and experienced alike and celebrate the upcoming solstice in <br/>
true letterboxing style.<br/>
<br/>
Organizers: Hattie (listed as Splish Splash on Atlas Quest), Nautilus, <br/>
and Oceanwytch with help from others on the Crazyboxingbuddies yahoo group.<br/>
Help with all aspects of planning including decorating, carving and <br/>
planting stamps, setup and cleanup, photographing the event, and raffle <br/>
donations are all welcome.<br/>
RSVPs would be appreciated.<br/>
There is nearby camping on route 9 at Beachwood Resort for adventurous <br/>
boxers from out of town. Nautilus and Culex may also have some space <br/>
available in their house for visitors.<br/>
Don't forget to bring clues with you to other nearby boxes such and <br/>
