                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-309981651">I just found out that I'm busy on Sunday November 6th, so is anyone free to go to do the Four Directions on Friday, November 11th?  It's Veteran's Day, and I'm hoping that some of you have the day off!<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to get a small crew to go, in two cars so that we can spot cars.  Please e-mail me if you're free to go.  If it rains on Friday, I may be able to move it to the Saturday or Sunday of that weekend.<br/>
