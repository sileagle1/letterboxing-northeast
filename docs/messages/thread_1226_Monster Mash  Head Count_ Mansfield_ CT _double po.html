days and replies flying out, I have a count of 103 (2-footed)<br/>
guests (a few of these folks hoping to come/probably coming--however,<br/>
life has a way of throwing curves at us!) 4 (4-pawed guests) have<br/>
agreed to accompany their owners to the gala event. ((Psst!!)) Hey<br/>
all you doggies!! A kind soul will be bringing you all a bag of<br/>
doggie TREATS!!<br/>
Your kind offers of help are greatly appreciated. This event<br/>
promises to be such an enjoyable occasion.<br/>
Please continue to send me your R.S.V.P.s My attendee list is a cut<br/>
and paste mess now, but I promise to neaten it up and offer to anyone<br/>
who wants an official copy of "The Guest List".<br/>
