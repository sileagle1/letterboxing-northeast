However, it was supposedly filled with very murky green water (ew..... probably smells too!), but the nice folks who found it took it home with them (note to self.... reminder to send them house deoderizer due to moldy smell from box...) to try and air it out.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, hopefully I will hear again from them soon so I can make arrangements to take the box home :-)  Now, if Eolia would just return from it's voyage out to sea......<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to the people who found it!<br/>
