<br/>
We got about a foot of snow out here on Friday.  The only way to <br/>
letterbox around here is with snow shoes or cross country skis.  <br/>
A new letterboxer and I where able to easily find Castle Rock and <br/>
Of Grass and Frogs	letteboxes  with about 2 inches on the <br/>
ground.  But now there is just TOO MUCH SNOW around here.<br/>
<br/>
The trip was a success - I got her hooked on letterboxing. She <br/>
even got an account on letterboxing.org and started to look up <br/>
letterboxes fot find (yahoo!) <br/>
<br/>
Did any only get a few inches of snow (maybe the down in the <br/>
Cape)?  How about Andover- did you folks get hit with a foot of <br/>
snow?  I have heard reports that the Burlington area got over a <br/>
foot too!  Are we left to only letterbox indoors until there is a thaw?<br/>
<br/>
Or are there people who have planted boxes above the snow line <br/>
with well marked trails?<br/>
<br/>
Choi reported last week that you could find Icarus in the snow.  Is <br/>
that still true ?<br/>

problem is in the covering your tracks! don't want to lead others to the<br/>
treasure. we got 15 1/2 inches of the stuff. and i know of quite a few boxes<br/>
around here that can still be gotten. <br/>

<br/>
  It was great meeting you yesterday. After I left, I headed to my childhood beach (First <br/>
Encounter) in Eastham. I had a noticed a tree down here and there as I drove. Around <br/>
Orleans I was shocked to see trees down everywhere! Eastham was just as bad. Just about <br/>
every yard had a fallen tree. Some yards had many. The small village green in Eastham, <br/>
where the windmill is, had a very large old tree in a heap on the ground. It was a very sad <br/>
sight. But then I saw the most beautiful sunset I think I've ever seen. It gave me hope that <br/>
the Cape that I love will bouce back.    <br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>
P.S. We got over a foot of snow here but no 70 mile an hour winds like the Cape got.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Greetings, <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   We got about a foot of snow out here on Friday.  The only way to <br/>
&gt; &gt;   letterbox around here is with snow shoes or cross country skis.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;   A new letterboxer and I where able to easily find Castle Rock and <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Of Grass and Frogs      letteboxes  with about 2 inches on the <br/>
&gt; &gt;   ground.  But now there is just TOO MUCH SNOW around here.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   The trip was a success - I got her hooked on letterboxing. She <br/>
&gt; &gt;   even got an account on letterboxing.org and started to look up <br/>
&gt; &gt;   letterboxes fot find (yahoo!) <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Did any only get a few inches of snow (maybe the down in the <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Cape)?  How about Andover- did you folks get hit with a foot of <br/>
&gt; &gt;   snow?  I have heard reports that the Burlington area got over a <br/>
&gt; &gt;   foot too!  Are we left to only letterbox indoors until there is a<br/>
&gt; thaw?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Or are there people who have planted boxes above the snow line <br/>
&gt; &gt;   with well marked trails?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Choi reported last week that you could find Icarus in the snow.  Is <br/>
&gt; &gt;   that still true ?<br/>

&gt; Hi Archimedes,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   It was great meeting you yesterday. After I left, I headed to my<br/>
childhood beach (First <br/>
&gt; Encounter) in Eastham. I had a noticed a tree down here and there as<br/>
I drove. Around <br/>
&gt; Orleans I was shocked to see trees down everywhere! Eastham was just<br/>
as bad. Just about <br/>
&gt; every yard had a fallen tree. Some yards had many. The small village<br/>
green in Eastham, <br/>
&gt; where the windmill is, had a very large old tree in a heap on the<br/>
ground. It was a very sad <br/>
&gt; sight. But then I saw the most beautiful sunset I think I've ever<br/>
seen. It gave me hope that <br/>
&gt; the Cape that I love will bouce back.    <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Take care, Orion<br/>
&gt; P.S. We got over a foot of snow here but no 70 mile an hour winds<br/>
like the Cape got.<br/>

We got about a foot of snow in Chelmsford/Westford/Carlisle MA  <br/>
I heard that the Burlington area  got about a foot of snow - of not <br/>
a little more.<br/>
<br/>
I thought last week when I handed a Girl Scout Hitchhicker to a <br/>
letterboxer in Hartford,  Connecticut - that I'd be getting the <br/>
Hitchhicker away from the snow - they got their first storm the <br/>
next day :(.<br/>
