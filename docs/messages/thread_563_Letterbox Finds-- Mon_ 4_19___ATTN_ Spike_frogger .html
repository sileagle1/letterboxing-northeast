First to Dinosaur S.P. to find "Native Flower" in 'decent' condition.<br/>
(inkpad has exploded) Then quickly moving on to "Walk Through <br/>
Geologic Time" --Boxes #1+#2 were fine. Box #3-"Eubrontes II" HAS <br/>
GONE MISSING!! All that was left behind were the rocks I believed <br/>
once covered it.(darn!) Then I shot up to Hartford to do "Cedar Hill <br/>
Cemetery" ****RTRW--Box#1-"Protecting Angel" has almost undoubtedly <br/>
gone missing!! Please replace, I love this place!**** Box#2 is fine, <br/>
but FYI-- The "leaning" tree it's under, is no longer leaning and has <br/>
fallen over. The box is now simply in a hole in the ground between <br/>
the fallen and standing trees. Boxes #3+#4 were fine with nothing to <br/>
report except that the last one is indeed a tricky find!(I almost <br/>
gave up on it before shifting my gaze elsewhere) Great series and an <br/>
awesome cemetery!! After finishing up, I spent an extra 1&amp; 1/2 hours <br/>
just looking around at the ornate markers. I highly recommend this <br/>
one if you haven't done it already. Thanks for the great time <br/>
guys!!! --Northstar       P.S.-- Sorry for the multitude of posts!</div>
