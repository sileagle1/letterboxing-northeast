friend of ours is looking for someone to do a short letterboxing <br/>
presentation to the East Lyme CT cub scouts. I'm one of those public-<br/>
speaking-ophobes who melts down into a puddle at the thought of <br/>
getting up in front of groups. Anyone up for it? If so, please write <br/>
to Charlie directly. His note is copied below. And thanks for saving <br/>
me from the trauma!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;If you could forward my name on to your letterboxing friends that<br/>
would be great.  Some of the details...the Cub Scout Pack meeting is <br/>
on<br/>
April 27th at 7PM in the Flanders Cafeteria...if the person could <br/>
talk for<br/>
15-20 minutes about letterboxing that would be perfect.  My home e-<br/>
mail<br/>
address is cuinct at myeastern dot com and my home phone number is <br/>
(*deleted, please write Charlie or Jay directly for the number*).<br/>
Thanks for the help,<br/>
<br/>
