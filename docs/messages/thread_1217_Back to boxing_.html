back to 'boxing this weekend as we went after Family from Mass' <br/>
Weather series in Callahan State Park.  As these are all new boxes, <br/>
they were all there, but at least one of the boxes (Sunshine) was in <br/>
a spot that was extremely difficult to cover.  The box was fairly <br/>
exposed when we found it, and, unfortunately due to the nature of <br/>
the hiding spot, fairly exposed when we left it.  It may not survive <br/>
long in its current location.<br/>
<br/>
We also picked up Gray Reservation ... a nice little spot in <br/>
Sudbury, MA.<br/>
<br/>
And, FINALLY ... after being the boy who cried wolf around here with <br/>
our placed boxes, we've managed to actually place two boxes and have <br/>
sent volunteer letterboxers out to test our clues.  As soon as they <br/>
report back, we'll make the clues public.  Next time I won't be so <br/>
anxious to announce the placement of a box!<br/>

Thanks for the tip on Sunshine.  It will be checked on and moved.  <br/>
New clues will be posted once its moved.<br/>
<br/>
Glad the rest were in good shape.<br/>
