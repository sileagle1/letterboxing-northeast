Oldhounder, Siamese found this to be the case last Friday.<br/>
But all the other boxes that we searched for were there, which is why we<br/>
thought you might have pulled them.<br/>
I wonder why they singled you out?<br/>
Well, we didn't find Danielle's 15th 5th box, but I made them leave early.<br/>
We also didn't search for Phineas (yet!)<br/>

I went out and confirmed that yes, indeed, they are gone - VERY <br/>

As we all know, many of us who plant boxes adopt the "it is easier to <br/>

<br/>
If I do nothing, I have lost the boxes, the stamps, and most <br/>

If I go to the park officials, and identify myself as the planter and <br/>
could I please have the boxes back (by now they are surely trash), I <br/>
risk being fined for whatever violation I committed.<br/>

I am just happy that these boxes had a long and happy life, and that <br/>

It's sorta like a Letterbox Men In Black where they would try and  <br/>

fact, the park rangers at Hopkinton did take the boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, there are many boxes in State Parks and Forests here in MA <br/>
that sit without issue.  To the best of my knowledge, no policy <br/>
exists which prohibits Geocaching or letterboxing on DCR property, <br/>
although some permit policies were being drafted.<br/>
<br/>
As I was intending on holding a letterboxing gathering at Hopkinton <br/>
next summer, I'll call them and inquire more specifically.  Perhaps I <br/>
can obtain the information necessary to confirm whether the DCR is <br/>
intending on following up with its permit policy or restrict the <br/>
hobby altogether.  A real shame either way -- DCR properties are <br/>
pretty significant tracts of land around here!<br/>
