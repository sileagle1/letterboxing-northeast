Another way is to have the box under the check out counter <br/>

Kingston Free Library in RI near URI.<br/>
<br/>
It is a wooden box that is shaped to look just like a hardcover <br/>
book.  (You could probably do it with a hollowed out hardcover book)<br/>
It has its own dewey decimal number on it.  It looks just like any <br/>
other book on the shelf.<br/>
<br/>
An ordinary library patron would probably just skip right by it.  A <br/>
letterboxer will find it immediately once the clues are solved.<br/>
<br/>
Since it is a normal sized "book", and it has its own dewey decimal <br/>
number on it, any reorganization of the library would not matter.  It <br/>
would stay in the same sequence with the other books, and any <br/>
additions or deletions to the library's contents also would not <br/>
affect the ability to find the box.<br/>

I covered it with muslin and we printed up labels. We used "Modge-Podge" to attach the fabric and labels. Dave then painted the sides of the book to look like the page edges to complete the faux book. Then Dave met with the local librarian to find out if they were interested and how we should "plant" the "book". The library actually treated our boxes like any new acquisition. They are registered and have library security tags. The Library assigned each "book" it's own shelf number based on the Dewey Decimal System. Then Dave wrote up the clues so that the letterboxer has to use the resources of the Library to figure out the Dewey Decimal number of the book. <br/>
Originally the N.E.S.S. boxes were going to be a bit more spread out, but our own library here in town took the 3 that Dave had ready to show the Librarian. <br/>
It's a good idea to have a sample box ready to show, so that the Library knows what its getting itself into. We also gave the Desk a copy of the "What is Letterboxing" handout. Just in case someone comes upon the box by accident. A willing Library staff is key to this idea. Afterall it's their place. <br/>

  Subject: [LbNE] Library boxes? (how to?)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  My mother-in-law is a librarian out in very Western MA.   She thinks<br/>
  letterboxing is neat and would love to have a letterbox in her library (a<br/>
  very small town).   How are library boxes typically "done" ?    I'm thinking<br/>
  that I'd like it to be something that she could easily see/observe from her<br/>
  area, but that once she's gone from the library (she'll probably retire in a<br/>
  few years), that I'd like the box to stay and not be removed by future<br/>
  librarians (who may not be as enthralled with LB'ing).   <br/>
