Chuck, who intervened for me....long story. Anyway, when I get it <br/>
back, it will be planted in a different spot. If you are planning on <br/>
building the castle sometime in the near future, it might be worth <br/>
your while to wait so you can get the dragon, too. Thanks to all <br/>
those who e-mailed me to let me know when you did the series and to <br/>
send condolences.<br/>
