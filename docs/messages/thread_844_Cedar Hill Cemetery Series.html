the cemetery and stayed after to do the series.  No luck with box <br/>
one, but all the other boxes were found!  If you haven't hiked in <br/>
the Cedar Hill cemetery, consider going to one of several historical <br/>
reenactment hikes.  The guides are in full costume, and there are <br/>
boxes to be found! Cedar Hill has a website so check out their other <br/>
hikes. One will be by lantern light!  Enjoy!  Painterly + 46R</div>
