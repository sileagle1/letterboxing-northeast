                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1130460793">Hi there, :)<br/>
<br/>
My family and I are planning to head out and spend a day doing the <br/>
Portland/South Portland boxes.  We're really eager to see what's out <br/>
there!<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering, for the East End series (which we're anxiously <br/>
anticipating), have there been "confirmed missing" boxes ?  I just <br/>
did a search on "east end" and came up with a few postings that <br/>
mentioned missing boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
*** We were also wondering if we could get the clues to the East End <br/>
Series?  <a href="mailto:YahYah@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YahYah@...</a> would be the best place to send them <br/>
if anyone would have the time to send them.  =:D  Can't wait to <br/>
tackle those!  ***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Questions about how these boxes are doing:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Munjoy Hill Observatory: a friend said she went and looked but <br/>
came up empty.  Was wondering if perhaps it'd been removed for some <br/>
reason? or perhaps it may be missing?  (or perhaps she was looking in <br/>
the wrong spot?)<br/>
<br/>
2.  Bug Light:  Still missing?<br/>
<br/>
3.  Spring Point: I have in my notes here "Pulled for Maintenance" <br/>
but the date is over 2 years old so I was wondering what the status <br/>
is on that box. <br/>
<br/>
4.  Missing You:  Says was pulled but will be replaced soon, would <br/>
anyone know if that one has been replaced?<br/>
<br/>
5.  Skyline:  My notes are a little over a year old, says it was <br/>
pulled for maintenance.  Any chance that one has been put out again? <br/>
=:D<br/>
<br/>
6.  Fort Allen Park:  My notes say about a year ago it was pulled for <br/>
the winter, to be replaced in the spring, check for updates.  Is this <br/>
box available?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you SO much, can't wait to get out there and Box Portland and <br/>
South Portland!<br/>
