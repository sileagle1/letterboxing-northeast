                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-56964828">one day as i was strolling through James E. Goodwin State Park, <br/>
Hampton, CT, and I happen to come across a letterbox that was very <br/>
badly damaged. It was called "Troll Letterbox". it is not posted <br/>
online on either site and i was hoping that you may know who the owner <br/>
is so i can talk to him/her. I have replaced all of the damaged goods <br/>
with new ones and it is my concern that the box is misplaced as well. <br/>
thanks for any help you may be able to provide. I have all the items <br/>
that needed to replaced, so that they can reunite with the owner.<br/>
