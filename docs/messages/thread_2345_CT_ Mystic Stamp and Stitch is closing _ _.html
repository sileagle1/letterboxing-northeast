                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-868529229">OK, I visited this store today.  The owner was really nice.  The box is still <br/>
there.  He said that the store would be closing at the end of September, and <br/>
that they would contact the placer via email about getting the box picked up.  <br/>
He also speculated that maybe he would just hand it off to another store in <br/>
the village, since the stamp says Olde Mystick Village, and not specifically <br/>
the name of their store.  But of course, that's all still up in the air.<br/>
<br/>
So go visit soon, if you haven't done so yet.  <br/>
<br/>
And yes, everything is 50% off!<br/>
