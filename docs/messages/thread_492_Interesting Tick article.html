WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Want to avoid ticks? Avoid sitting on logs, <br/>
experts advised on Thursday. <br/>
<br/>
Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, used <br/>
themselves as bait to see where the greatest risk of picking up a <br/>
tick was, and found logs were the worst places to sit. <br/>
<br/>
"We sat on logs for only five minutes at a time, and in 30 percent of <br/>
the cases, it resulted in exposure to ticks," said Robert Lane, a <br/>
professor of insect biology who led the study. <br/>
<br/>
"It didn't matter if we sat on moss or the bare surface; the ticks <br/>
were all over the log surface. The next riskiest behavior was <br/>
gathering wood, followed by sitting against trees, which resulted in <br/>
tick exposure 23 percent and 17 percent of the time, respectively," <br/>
Lane said in a statement. <br/>
<br/>
Writing in the Journal of Medical Entomology, Lane and colleagues <br/>
said they were looking for ticks carrying Borrelia burgdorferi, the <br/>
bacteria that cause Lyme disease. <br/>
<br/>
"If we're going to develop effective strategies and educational <br/>
programs for the prevention of Lyme disease, it is critical that we <br/>
understand how people are exposed to the ticks that transmit the <br/>
bacteria in the first place," Lane said in a statement. <br/>
<br/>
"We intentionally looked at behaviors that people would typically <br/>
engage in while spending time in the woods." <br/>
<br/>
Sitting in leaves was not especially risky, they found.</div>

can bet I'll keep this in mind the next time I'm out in the woods.  <br/>
And it makes great trail conversation, too.  :)<br/>
