<br/>
Phyto &amp; Isosceles reside in Bangor. Casco Bay Painter is in Portland. Weathergleams <br/>
I think are in Yarmouth???? Nautilus &amp; Culex are in Sanford, Memlili is in Southwest <br/>
Harbor, Hockamock-Coop is in Bangor, and yeah. There are quite a few new people <br/>
springing up around. Giddy is a prolific planter in southern maine. I couldn't forget <br/>
Merenwen &amp; Olwe in the Gorham/Portland area too!!! <br/>
<br/>
I've placed a couple of boxes here and there. You can find our clues here:<br/>

I am recently exiled from Maine! I live in Boston now, but had been <br/>
living in the mid-coast region (Boothbay) for about 2 years. I still <br/>
spend at least one weekend a month there... usually more. Maine has <br/>
lots of great boxers, as you will find. And, I think, while there may <br/>
be fewer boxes than some states, the boxes are among the best in the <br/>
Northeast. (CT people... don't beat me up for saying that!!)<br/>
<br/>
Check the files section for one of my boxes... I have more on the big <br/>
site if you'd like. And here's my stupid little website... I don't <br/>
have much on there now but I'm working on it.<br/>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/amymisha/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/amymisha/</a><br/>
Take care! Hope to meet you on the trail someday...<br/>

Not only is Katahdin her yahoo name, it is also the name of her <br/>
baby... the cutest baby in the entire world, who also happens to be <br/>
my nephew! : ) Big name for a little baby. <br/>
Yep... my sister is on the list. Yipee!<br/>

&gt; You know, I'd just like to say, I love your name on this group: <br/>
&gt; Katahdin.  What a great name!  =)  Can't believe I never noticed it <br/>
&gt; before.  What a great mountain!  Someone needs to hide a letterbox <br/>
up <br/>
&gt; there.  I'd bet my bottom dollar that Baxter SP would frown on such <br/>
&gt; activities, but ugh, it pains my heart not to see a box up there.  <br/>
&gt; *sigh*  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anywho.....  I just had to get that off my chest.  Thanks for <br/>
&gt; listening.  =)<br/>

</span></blockquote>Yeah, but what can I say?  I'm a flop and a failure!  It's <br/>
humiliating!  *sniffle*<br/>
<br/>
As for the baby named Katahdin, way cool!  =)  I bet the tyke gets a <br/>
job as a ranger at Baxter later in life.  Imagine the mayham to <br/>
ensue.  "Where's Katahdin?"  "Oh, in the back office."  "Huh?!"  =)  <br/>
Heaven forbid if he moves out of the area, though.  Speaking on <br/>
behalf of west coast people everywhere, nobody out here can pronounce <br/>
the name correctly to save their lives.<br/>
