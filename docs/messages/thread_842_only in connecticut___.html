older sister and my father! It was the first time she had ever met <br/>
another boxer on the trail, and the first time my Dad had gone out to <br/>
box!  My father related his story to me over a Father's Day lunch,  <br/>
and I immediately remember the 'Only in Connecticut' post!  How <br/>
intriguing.<br/>

</span></blockquote>We've considered this, actually I have even carved 2 stamps for a <br/>
local pond.  Unfortunately our current housing situation keeps me <br/>
from using my kayak much and has squelched my initial drive to do <br/>
so.  <br/>
<br/>
In a nutshell, we live in a condomunium and my kayak is hanging up <br/>
high in my parents garage. So access is limited and a royal pain to <br/>
wrestle the boat down, etc.    We'll be moving the end of next month <br/>
and the kayak's coming with us.... sooooo look for a few aqua boxes <br/>
by the end of this summer in SE CT.  Heidi and I will be literally <br/>
next to the Thames River in Ledyard, CT and once some exploring is <br/>
completed (and some wall painting and floor sanding in the new <br/>
house...) , we'll be back to planting! <br/>
<br/>
It is truly a fun idea!  <br/>
<br/>
-Steve (Heidi, and Madras) <br/>
<br/>
PS - Check out the Selden Island Campsites boxes if you are looking <br/>
to come kayak in Connecticut. We've not done these boxes, but have <br/>
paddled that part of the Conn River and its very very nice!</div>
