Westerly, RI.<br/>
<br/>
(hangs head in shame)<br/>
<br/>
My name is Warrior Woman.  I blatantly admit that I haven't done box <br/>
maintenance in this series since it was placed in July 2003.<br/>
<br/>
I received an email indicating that the series was in poor shape.  I <br/>
even got a sodden log book in the mail.<br/>
<br/>
I went out yesterday (Sunday October 10) to do a box maintenance on <br/>
all 7 boxes.<br/>
<br/>
The Good News:<br/>
<br/>
All the boxes were there.<br/>
<br/>
The Bad News:<br/>
<br/>
All the boxes were there lying in plain sight, some with the <br/>
containers open.<br/>
<br/>
Also, two landmarks (a junked blue car and a white Wildlife <br/>
Restoration sign) were missing.<br/>
<br/>
During the walk down the trails, I found all the parts of the junked <br/>
blue car.  I hauled 'em all back to where they are "supposed" to be <br/>
according to my clues ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Also, on an extreme outlying trail, I found on the ground a discarded <br/>
white Wildlife Restoration sign.  I taped it to the tree where the <br/>
old one had fallen (got ripped?) off.<br/>
<br/>
So, both clues are back in place.<br/>
<br/>
All the boxes now have been cleaned thoroughly, new paper towels and <br/>
baggies, new inkpads where needed, and in two case, new log books.<br/>
<br/>
My anal-retentive teenaged daughter was so upset about how the boxes <br/>
were found that she demanded the task of rehiding them well.<br/>
<br/>
(skips in glee - I've raised a responsible letterboxer!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow - I just wanted to report that this particularly out of the <br/>
way 7 box series is now in tip top shape, the clue landmarks have <br/>
been restored, and the trees are turning *beautiful* colours in this <br/>
area.  It's worth the ride.<br/>
<br/>
I came out of the trail with two (count 'em - TWO) FULL black <br/>
trashbags - and -<br/>
<br/>
NOT ONE HITCHIKER!<br/>
<br/>
But the satisfaction lies in the fact that I left the entire trail <br/>
system better than how I found it, and all the boxes are now <br/>
*perfectly* in order.<br/>
