<br/>
I posted (LB_usa)inquiry back in April about this meetup.com and <br/>
got the sense it was a 'dud'.  If you look further into the site <br/>
there is always a DATE but never an AGENDA/Location.  I have since <br/>
come to rely on the LB-usa or my local LBma for real gather info.  <br/>
<br/>
I also watch LBNE just to keep in touch -- actually I have a hard <br/>
time remembering who is NE and who is M-A I jump between groups so <br/>
often.<br/>
<br/>
But if you are looking for another gather, did you review the one <br/>
scheduled for Jul 9-10-11 in PA?  Camping at www.colonialwoods.com <br/>
(alpha sites around ball field) and boxing at <br/>
www.washingtoncrossing.com.<br/>
<br/>
Irene, Hikers_n_Hounds, is coordinating.  I was hoping some of you <br/>
guys would find your way there.  If I can drive 3:05, the 2:49 should <br/>
be a breeze for you - besides I found gas to be cheaper on the NJ Tpk <br/>
when I drove home in May.<br/>
