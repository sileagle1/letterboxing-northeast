finding the Monsters in Mansfield. Took me all month, but finally did<br/>
it!  In addition to the list of Monsters, I picked up 86 "permanent"<br/>
boxes that were in the areas that I searched during the month. <br/>
That's one great way to raise your F count!  What fun it was and many<br/>
thanks to all who made boxes, especially those from out of state<br/>
whose carvings we might not otherwise see.  I have all of you noted<br/>
in my log book.  <br/>
