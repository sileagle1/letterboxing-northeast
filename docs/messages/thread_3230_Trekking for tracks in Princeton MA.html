confirmed that the Fierce Fisher is Missing.  I pulled the River Otter <br/>
for maintenance, and the Bobcat has been Missing for quite some time.  <br/>
However, the Spiny Pig is intact - only one hit this year. Did not <br/>
check the Black Bear or Moose on the Loose but hope they are still in <br/>
place as they are furthest from Sanctuary headquarters.<br/>
Any info on these two boxes would be appreciated in the meantime.<br/>
