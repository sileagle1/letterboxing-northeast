<br/>
   I was so tempted to get to the Cape this past Saturday for the Egg Hunt but between <br/>
some work related stuff and Easter, even I knew I couldn't go (usually it's just the <br/>
reasonable people telling me I'm crazy to do these wonderful spontaneous things). So, I <br/>
was wondering- next weekend is going to be Easter for the orthodox churches of the <br/>
world and you folks are coming to the Ice Scream Sundae event.... Wouldn't it be ironic if a <br/>
few of those E.B. eggs showed up in Carslilse?! *Huge hint with fingers crossed!*<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>

Cape was the whole point of the exercise! I mean the Easter Bunny (Known to E.B. to a <br/>
lucky few) lost his eggs in Yarmouth, not all over the state! I certainly hope that this <br/>
becomes an annual event. Thanks to the wonderful Cape boxers, I seem to be planning <br/>
trips to the Cape a lot more than I used to. And as Martha says "That's a good thing!"<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the good work!!!<br/>
