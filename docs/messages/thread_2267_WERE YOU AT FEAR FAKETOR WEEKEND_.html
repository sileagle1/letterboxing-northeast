Great great location!  Campground with swimming, mini golf, and boating!  Lots of wonderful fellow letterboxers!  Great food - awesome games for both young and old!  Prizes galore!  Hunts in all directions!!!!  Loved Celtic, Phobias, Red/Blue Trail, Challenges (karaoke anyone?), Yellow Trail, Cemetary Finds, Campers Bingo!!!!  Night boxing that was so much fun we didn't want it to end!  There was so much going on - you had to make your choices wisely to fit it all in!!!!  To all letterboxers who attended - I really enjoyed all the laughter and fun.  MayEve, Tamsyn, Celtic Quinn (who has an AWESOME Davinci Code stamp), NorthStar (you rock), Brandy - a beautiful, beautiful logbook for Vaudeville Act (WOW!), Dawnlanders - best camping partners in the world!!!!  I could go on and on.......................<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1847283339">Were YOU at Fear Faketor?  Yes I was!  Bluebird and I had a wonderful time!  There was barely time to even breathe since there was SO much to do and see!  Friday night started with setting up camp, a Bingo trivia game (I'm still kicking myself for not getting official exchanges with many of the campers!!!) and cooking smores!  Too bad those people (not letterboxers) at the end of the campground couldn't stay quiet!!!  I could have used the sleep to rev up for Saturday!<br/>
<br/>
Saturday started off with getting a head start on Boch's Circus.  These stamps were AWESOME!  Some of the circus acts on the trails included the Peep Show, Tables Turned 1 and 2,  Charlie Chaplin, Puppetmaster, Contortionist etc.  We then headed to the pavilion to meet many new faces!  Tamsyn, Betsy Ross and crew, Celtic Quinn (great Da Vinci Code stamp!), Tanned Rick from Boca Raton (yes you heard right), among old faces added to the great time!  Warcat you rock on the grill!  The Sushi salad was fantastic!  The brownies..YUM!!!  Had fun at the Clue game!  Bluebird and I won second and first prizes respectively!  When I got home, I wore my first prize ribbon, and PSU Fan looked at me kind of strange... what does he know??????  I also sent my tickets for the raffle with Brandy, You're a FIne Girl, and won two things!  Wow!  I never win raffles... I should send my tickets with others more often!<br/>
<br/>
Night boxing was GREAT!  I had so much fun looking for the glow in the dark bracelets and necklaces attached to trees!  That was a great idea!<br/>
<br/>
Sunday started with break of camp and the red trail!  Then we headed home the scenic route, stopping along the Route 4 corridor for some drive by boxes.  We were SO tired from all of the hiking this weekend, we just couldn't get ourselves to do one of the FOur Directions series!  <br/>
<br/>
All in all, a great weekend!  THanks to Talking Turtle and Kreepy Kelli (and Donny too!  You rock at pulling boxes :-) for a great time! <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-884946525">YES!!!  We were there! Team Safari showed NO FEAR of driving out of RI and all the way to NY.<br/>
<br/>
It was truly a great time!!!!<br/>
<br/>
We had to leave late on Friday from RI and rolled into camp after midnight... just in time to eject some noisy squatters from our site. &lt;s&gt;...  too bad they moved on to annoy other people. (These were the non-boxers who kept many campers awake through a good portion of the night.)<br/>
<br/>
We have some fun memories of this event, and some ironic ones.  <br/>
<br/>
Our one vehicle that is in somewhat good working order developed a caliper problem so we need a brake job now.  We were there and safe anyway!!  Others had a flat and a muffler fall off, but nothing was stopping them from getting there...<br/>
<br/>
So what's the official name for Fear of MIssing a Letterboxing Event?<br/>
<br/>
After the squatters left, we tried to quietly set up our site just enough to get some sleep.  We tried to let everyone sleep while we set up camp and we took turns blowing up the air mattress by blowing into it with our mouths because the inflator is loud enough to wake the dead.  Dan was falling asleep while huffing and decided to take the mattress out of the tent and inflate it down by the lake.  The inflator fan had an explosion and quit, so he used an alternate compressor, and finished the job...  driving back to the campsite area he got all mixed up and on a dead end, and turned around to retrace his journey, and ::: What the heck?!?  What now? What's that big thing in the road?  It wasn't there a minute ago!  Oh, it it's a double-high queen air mattress.  Never mind.<br/>
<br/>
I tended the home fires for the hour and a half he was gone, and was so relieved to see the Jeep come rolling up with the bed on top. My eyes were rolling around in my head by then. <br/>
<br/>
Funny how hard those beds are to put into the tent _after_ they are inflated.<br/>
<br/>
Was anybody watching this comedy???  <br/>
<br/>
No matter what adventure or calamity comes along, we have fun. :-)<br/>
<br/>
THANK YOU TT AND KK FOR A FANTASTIC TIME!!  Special thanks to TT for letting us "pull up the rear" on the night boxing before pulling the boxes.  Letterboxers are truly wonderful people.<br/>
<br/>
We hung around after breaking camp. We sat high on the hill above the lakes and watched the people at the park enjoy the summer day.  The sounds of summer drifted up on the breezes: the fountains spraying, the kids playing, the music from a local company's family picnic, clinking horseshoes...  On the fishing and boating we watched paddle boats and rowboats.  One man tried to get the hang of rowing but stayed within about 50' of the dock paddling backwards, in circles; he and his woman companion watched a man and a girl row smoothly on by...<br/>
<br/>
We lay on the grass in the shade of a big oak for about an hour and a half, and had a picnic lunch before boxing.  <br/>
<br/>
Clouds rolled in and thunder rumbled as we climbed the trail.  I think Brontophobia is a good thing.  So is Thanatophobia or Necrophobia, if they keep you out of the woods in t-storms.  Dan says, "Well, actually, statistically, you have only a ____ chance in _____  thousand of getting struck by lightning..."  Well, those statistics are based on the fact that most people are smart enough to not go hiking in electrical storms and have not been killed because they have made safer choices, right?  <br/>
<br/>
We got a few boxes before going home. Rain I can take. It was cool and refreshing, especially on the orange trail. Thunder passing to the north is disconcerting but not too scary.  The sky cleared and the sun came out just as we found a scarab beetle not on any of our clue sheets. &lt;insert heavenly voices singing as the sun rays light our log book&gt;  But the clear skies were not to last, and flashing and thunder overhead is way too close for me, especially with evidence of trees struck by lightning right on the trail !!!!!!!!  Must go now. Must go faster. We left the park just before nightfall.  An attendant grinned at us tromping through the rain to the car.  <br/>
<br/>
That park was great. So was the staff. Thanks to the organizers, carvers, and planters.<br/>

I also enjoyed the themed aspect of the stamps (especially the top ten <br/>
fears) and the different ways you could share letterboxing clues. Such <br/>
as the word-of-mouth clue that got passed from person to person and led <br/>
to a letterbox near the pavillion. Someone said there was one letterbox <br/>
clue that could only be found by looking in the womens restroom in the <br/>
campground.<br/>
