I have an outing planning to the Lloyd Center in S. Dartmouth in a few<br/>
weeks.  <a href="http://www.thelloydcenter.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thelloydcenter.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
I was planning to introduce a good friend of mine to letterboxing that<br/>
day.  But much to my surprise, I have just checked Altas Quest and<br/>
letterboxing.org and there are none that I can find for that location.<br/>
 I am suprised, I really thought I would have my pick!<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of any WOM boxes there?  Or am I missing something on<br/>
the websites and there is one?  Any suggestions would be very welcome!<br/>
