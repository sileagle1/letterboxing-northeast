<br/>
I've noticed a disturbing new trend in list habits...crossposting <br/>
the same posts to the big list and this one. What do all of you <br/>
think about this? It seems to me that most folks here read both <br/>
lists anyway, hence there is no need to post twice.<br/>
<br/>
Right now it's a minor percentage of the posts but I'm worried about <br/>
developing bad habits that, as the list gets larger and more <br/>
established, will make wading through all the posts a chore.<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts? Moderators, what do YOU think?<br/>

I try to post things that are specifically directed towards new england/northeast <br/>
folks on this list.  However, I am guilty of posting to both lists that I have a "new <br/>
box" because I have chosen not to list any of my boxes under "what's new" and <br/>
since most of my boxes ok- all of them are in new england, I post to both lists.<br/>
<br/>
Those who look for our boxes know pretty much where to look now, so I'll <br/>
eliminate the double post. Thanks for pointing that out.</div>

What to do about infractions is a little harder.  I typically let it <br/>
slide at first in the hopes that problem will just 'go away'.  You <br/>
laugh, but it really works sometimes!  =)  Many of the cross-posters <br/>
are new to this board and don't realize that pretty much EVERYONE in <br/>
the northeast are members of this board, so they post to the main <br/>
board in the hopes of catching those that aren't.  After a while on <br/>
the board, they realize posting a dulplicate message to the main <br/>
board is overkill and stop on their own.<br/>
<br/>
And the occasional post such as your own also help nip that cross-<br/>
posting habit in the bud.  You've already embarrassed Phyto into <br/>
submission.  ;o)  Probably several others too!  (Don't worry, Phyto, <br/>
we won't hold it against it you!)  But the occasional gentle reminder <br/>
never hurts.<br/>
<br/>
If I notice a person becoming a cross-posting menece with no signs of <br/>
abating, then I'll e-mail them personally that it's not really <br/>
appropriate and that usually solves the problem.  This board I don't <br/>
watch very closely, however, and there's probably a lot of cross <br/>
posting I don't notice. <br/>
<br/>
I've never really discussed the issue with Brian, but I know he <br/>
frowns on cross-posting as well.  Whether he has a 'method' for <br/>
handling it--I don't know.  We both try to take a 'hands-off' <br/>
approach to moderation.  I wish I could say it was for some noble <br/>
purpose, but for me it basically amounts to being too lazy to take <br/>
a 'hands-on' approach to moderation.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this answers some of your questions!<br/>
