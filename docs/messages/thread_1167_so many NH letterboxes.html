                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-423699755">I was just noticing that there had been about a 50% increase in NH letterboxes since April.  There were about 100 boxes when we first started and now there are almost 150!  I can't wait to get back out and get some more.  This summer hasn't gone as I expected.  I figured we'd be boxing all summer........  Instead, we had company for 2 and a half weeks and the day they left my husband convinced me we should make an offer on another house.  Consequently we've been cleaning and major hauling out of this place to one show it and two get rid of stuff because the new place is smaller.  Who ever heard of moving to a smaller place when you are raising 3 kids?  We must be insane!  Anyway, hopefully we'll do some fall boxing.  I guess the winter will be spent coming up with new boxes to place in the spring.<br/>
