<br/>
If you emailed me today you don't need to go to the website.  Anyone who has not RSVP'd yet should do so soon!<br/>
<br/>
I have gotten requests from people who will be camping over the weekend for clues.  I will be emailing you off list by Thursday night as to how and where you can get the clues you need!<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  Dogs are allowed but must be on a leash at all times.  We are expecting over 100 people.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who has a few pieces of firewood, we would like to ask you to bring them.  There is a large fireplace in the pavillion that we can use.  It might be nice to have a fire, especially if it rains.  Also, if it rains we might like to have a lantern or two as it might get a bit dark inside!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the help!<br/>
