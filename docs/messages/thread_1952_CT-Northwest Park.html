boxious day in Windsor today.  We found all published boxes for this <br/>
park!! Well over 20 in all.  If there's mysteries there, don't tell us <br/>
for at least a week!!! We think we hiked at least 7 miles and it was <br/>
such a beautiful day for doing just that.  I've contacted the placers <br/>
off the big list of any repairs needed- there really aren't many.  All <br/>
boxes were easily found.It was a full 7 hours. Many thanks to all who <br/>
have planted here and every where else.  We sure do love this hobby!! <br/>
Happy Boxing Everyone-Sunshine :0)</div>
