                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-898674189">Uh huh.  The problem is that there are a number of trails that <br/>
apparently are now "restricted" due to their proximity to the <br/>
reservoir.  My guess is that they reruited some of the major trails <br/>
to stay outside of the restricted area.  I suppose we could have <br/>
simply stayed on the couple of blazed trails rather than travelling <br/>
on the other trails, but what fun would that be?<br/>
<br/>
If I had any suggestion for the reservation, though, I'd encourage <br/>
the use of intersection references -- similar to the Blue Hills.  <br/>
That would help ...<br/>
<br/>
It's a nice reservation, just be aware of the trail challenges.  A <br/>
map would do wonders!  Apparently the Department of Conservation and <br/>
Recreation (which manages the Reservation) doesn't sell trail maps <br/>
anymore, though.<br/>
