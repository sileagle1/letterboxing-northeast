Hi I'm not a member of the letterboxing lists any longer.  I was<br/>
hoping you'd post this for me...<br/>
<br/>
I was hiking through Mansfield Hollow Park on Saturday and found a<br/>
stamp in the path.  The stamp says "ESKER" a few steps more and I<br/>
found two plastic bags, one large and one small with a paper towel in<br/>
it.  A few feet further I found the lid and the box.  The box is<br/>
cracked in the corner.  I looked all around and did not see a log<br/>
book.  Perhaps the owner would like to know and they can go explore<br/>
looking for the logbook and update lbna.org.<br/>
<br/>
thx, Fisher</div>

The series was freshened up in 2005 by volunteers fixing Carolyn's boxes. Anyway, It is listed on LBNA under Mansfield Center, planter is Carolyn, name is Kettle Hole Series and it is box #2. The person should be able to get a hold of Carolyn through contact the placer.  If that don't work, I would be happy to pass along a message. I doubt she needs the stamp back. It can be remade quickly. It's just the word ESKER as a negative carve into speedy-cut. Glad I could be of some help...Chuck of WWW<br/>
