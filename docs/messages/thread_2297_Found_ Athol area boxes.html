<br/>
Great Saturday spent 'boxing!  Thanks to Choi who accompanied me on a<br/>
hunt for a box I can't mention here (sorry -- but don't you love<br/>
mysteries).<br/>
<br/>
After Choi and I parted company, I hiked up Tully Mountain (Orange,<br/>
MA) and got the letterbox on the peak -- in fine shape, but the clues<br/>
are a bit tough -- "look for the double trunked oak growing next to a<br/>
rock" -- uh, there were about 20 of them ...  LOL.  Persistence paid<br/>
off, though!  Nice views from up there.<br/>
<br/>
I then went after lazy letterboxer's Lightening My Load series in<br/>
Athol.  All 7 boxes intact.  Along the way I ran into Sue from Pelham,<br/>
MA.  I don't think she has a trail name other than that but she said<br/>
she's been 'boxing for 4 years now.  This was actually my first<br/>
encounter meeting another letterboxer on the trail outside of<br/>
gatherings (the others were on the trails in Mansfield last October<br/>
which isn't qutie the same).  She was with what I presumed to be her<br/>
husband, and we finished the series together.<br/>
<br/>
I told her she should come to a gathering, but she won't be able to<br/>
make it to Moose Hill this weekend -- she's quite pregant and due this<br/>
week!!  She may be able to make it to the gathering on October 1st though.</div>
