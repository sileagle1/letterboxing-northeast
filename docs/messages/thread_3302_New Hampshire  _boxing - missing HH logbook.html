                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1806679999">Hi all - hoping someone might be able to shed some light on a missing <br/>
logbook situation.  Just got an e-mail that my HH "A Bad Day of <br/>
Letterboxing..." was found Oct 27th in "Blue Bear's Adventure" <br/>
letterbox, Windham NH, without its logbook.<br/>
Sometime in early October it was dropped off intact at "Mine Falls <br/>
Park" letterbox in Nashua, NH, but somewhere in between those <br/>
letterboxes, it lost its logbook!<br/>
Did anyone pick up my HH in October and perhaps forgot to put the <br/>
logbook back in the tin?<br/>
Any help is much appreciated :-)<br/>
Thanks - sojourner</div>
