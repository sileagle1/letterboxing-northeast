                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2041141562">Thanks! Jay for the latest report on the last 3 EL HS<br/>
letterboxes. Here's the info I have.<br/>
Tory of "Sam &amp; Tory's letterbox" wrote &amp; said his<br/>
puppie chewed up the stamp (dog ate his homework?).<br/>
"We are Awesome" had no stamp, no reply from placer.<br/>
No response from "AAARRR" on any other clues to that<br/>
box, glad you couldn't find it either Jay! (Does<br/>
crescent= crevice?)<br/>
"Pricker Madness" did not have a stamp in the second<br/>
box, &amp; I asked if they might consider moving the box<br/>
to a drier location. They thanked me for writing. I<br/>
wrote the placer of "Wizard, Witch &amp; Horse" &amp;<br/>
suggested the Horse box have a less obvious hiding<br/>
place. I got a reply from the teacher, Amy Fabry, &amp;<br/>
she said she would pass that information on to her<br/>
students. The "Cub Scout Pack 7 Tiger" box was fine at<br/>
the time we did it.<br/>
Happy Trails!   Lobsta Lady<br/>
