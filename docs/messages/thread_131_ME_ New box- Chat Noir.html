for some unpublished ones soon... I've been productive lately.<br/>
<br/>
Chat Noir<br/>
<br/>
Easy Box. Handcarved stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Located at the Robert B Tristam Coffin Wild Flower Sanctuary.<br/>
<br/>
From Route 1 in Woolwich, take Route 127 North. Turn left onto Route<br/>
128 and drive for 5 miles to Chopps Point Road on your left. You can<br/>
park in the area to the right of the intersection.<br/>
<br/>
Start the trail at the right hand corner of the parking lot. As you<br/>
walk you will pass a stone wall on your right and walk between big<br/>
boulders on your right and left.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on the trail until you see a tree with a blue blaze on your<br/>
left and a large mossy rock on your right. Just ahead you will see a<br/>
tree on your right with a New England Wildflower Society medallion on it. <br/>
<br/>
Look left. Do you see the large boulder atop a small hill? Carefully<br/>
climb the hill and explore the Boulder. Chat Noir is hidden in a<br/>
crevice, carefully covered with leaves and twigs. Please rehide<br/>
carefully and well!<br/>
<br/>
You may continue on the trail and loop back to the lot, or turn and<br/>
walk back to your car.</div>
