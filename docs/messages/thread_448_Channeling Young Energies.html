has not happened on a LB related talklist before (that we are aware <br/>
of).  We don't disagree with Brian's decision to freeze everything <br/>
and then sort it out either. That was the responsible thing to do as <br/>
a moderator and a leader of this sect of letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
We think each and every poster on this list has a certain <br/>
responsibility to guide young energies such as that brough forth by <br/>
HikerLou. Everyone can help because we all have experience in the <br/>
outdoors and in life itself.  Hopefully we can all guide Lou a little <br/>
bit -- be it on the trail or on the list. We appreciate his <br/>
enthusiasm and hopefully with some wisdom from the experienced <br/>
letterboxers, HikerLou will be able to SAFELY enjoy a lifelong hobby!<br/>
