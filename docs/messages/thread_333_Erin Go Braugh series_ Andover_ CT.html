virtually all her letterboxes, the historical background info. is <br/>
fascinating to read. Stamps are a distinct pleasure also.  All boxes <br/>
are intact (I did some minimal drying out and placing paper towels <br/>
around stamps.  There is  a overly wet ink pad at box # 3 so I used <br/>
one of mine.<br/>
  I had the trail to myself, just an occasional bird call.  Note: <br/>
muddy does not even begin to describe the trail--streams cross it, so <br/>
be sure to wear waterproof boots. <br/>
  Now for another alert: Sheesh!! Sorry, but feel I must comment. <br/>
Walking back from the last box, after the Y and before the Blarney <br/>
Castle l.b. I saw 2 used syringes on the trail.  (Cars have driven in <br/>
on the trail even though it is forbidden.) I did not have the <br/>
capabilities to safely pick up and dispose of these items. If any of <br/>
you are going out there and are willing to use a plastic bag as a <br/>
glove to place these items in a hard sided container of cardboard or <br/>
plastic to dispose of at home that would be wonderful.</div>
