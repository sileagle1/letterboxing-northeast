I showed this post to my husband (Culex), and he wanted to respond to it:<br/>
Hi, um just a little correction to the post about ticks. Working with <br/>
Lyme disease in Maine, I can say that if folks are finding any ticks <br/>
before May in New England, they are probably deer ticks. My lab has <br/>
begun seeing some out and about. The deer ticks out now and in the fall <br/>
are adults, about the size of an apple seed, and can most certainly <br/>
cause Lyme disease. Females are  red &amp; black while the males are jet <br/>
black to the naked eye. Deer tick nymphs are the ones that are "the size <br/>
of the head of a pin," and usually show up June - mid August. The big <br/>
ticks found in the summer with white on the back are dog (or wood) ticks <br/>
and are the carriers of Rocky Mountain Spotted-Fever, which has <br/>
occasionally shown up in Mass and CT. The point about applying Vapo Rub <br/>
is a bad idea. That and trying to burn a tick with a match can actually <br/>
cause the tick to regurgitate its gut contents back into you before it <br/>
pulls out. That might some nasty juices flowing the wrong way! Using a <br/>
very fine pair of forceps (tweezers) to gently pull the tick back out is <br/>
the best way. Be patient, deer ticks have a barbed beak and yanking <br/>
might result in the head and beak staying in your skin while the body <br/>
comes away.<br/>
Thanks for putting up with a long-winded public health message. My lab's <br/>
website is <a href="http://zappa.mmcri.mmc.org/lyme/lymehome.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://zappa.mmcri.mmc.org/lyme/lymehome.html</a><br/>

Happy hunting!<br/>
