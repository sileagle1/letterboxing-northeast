I have been celebrating it at the stroke of midnight with a bang ever since First Night has been having fireworks.  Alas, I don't see any First Night or fireworks scheduled.  :-(   Dan was talking about taking me to Boston on the Eve.  Any input to me about possible fireworks would be greatly appreciated.  And if 'boxing can be done the same day sans crowds, even better!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, as for the weekend of the 27 &amp; 28, we can probably do the Saturday in CT, weather permitting.  Sunday *should* be kids day for Dan, but that can be changed at an ex's will.  :-(  I won't go without him. :-)  We aren't CT or MA folks, but we're LB folks.  Close enough?  ;-D<br/>
