white dog, Sam,  Dropped off at 'the CA Whale' in Long Beach,<br/>
California.   I've emailed wanda and pete and hope it shows up on<br/>
their HH tracking page, also joined a LB group in Southern Cal and got<br/>
the message out.  I  checked the box I dropped it off in 1 week later<br/>
and it hadn't been visited and the HH was still there.  LBers aren't<br/>
as prolific as here in CT.</div>
