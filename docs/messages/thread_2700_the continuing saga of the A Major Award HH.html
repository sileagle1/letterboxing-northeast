I just got an email about _A Major Award/Celebrations HH_. Seems that the original stamp and the _Celebrations_ Letterbox logbook have turned up in Massachusetts.<br/>
Dave and I had launched _A Major Award HH_  way back from a now defunct RI letterbox in Coventry, RI. The HH is based on a scene from one of Dave's favorite movies - "A Christmas Story". Remember the father receives a telegram informing him that he has won "A Major Award". The award turns out to be a sexy pink and black leg-shaped lamp (not a bowling alley).<br/>
One of the hitchhiker's first trips was to DisneyWorld. At some point the Lampshade stamp left the _Celebrations_ box with the _Celebrations_ logbook for parts unknown. The origninal logbook was then returned to Dave and I and Dave eventually re-carved the stamp and we sent them both on their way again!<br/>
I'm not sure how we're going to separate the travels of these two HH's. Maybe we need to rename the original stamp's travels _A Major Celebration_, since the second stamp has the original logbook with it.<br/>
