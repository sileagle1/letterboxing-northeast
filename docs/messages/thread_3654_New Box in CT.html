boxes, I planted one yesterday at Gillette Castle.  The added benefit <br/>
of going to the park is that you can see the newly renovated locomotive <br/>
that was just returned.  It is beautiful!!!<br/>
Also, I have replaced my Cove Cemetery box right down the road.  I had <br/>
pulled it after all the nasty thievery, but have decided to put it back.<br/>
Happy Boxing!!<br/>

Left Inside event at the castle a couple weekends ago. I loved your <br/>
event stamp and was glad to see my dad able to be such a joker with <br/>
you all:-)<br/>
 I did not know that one could subscribe to receive announcements of <br/>
new boxes and will have tocheck out that L.B.N.A. feature. thankjs <br/>
for the heads up.<br/>
