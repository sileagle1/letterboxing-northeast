northern NH out as a possible retirement location....... We only <br/>
managed to go after 3 boxes in between rainstorms and hail (ok, ok, and <br/>
yardsaling....), but had a great weekend. :-)<br/>

<br/>
Old Man Lives On -- Couldn't locate this one. Found what *had* to be <br/>
the boulder, but the base was completely flooded after the rains. We <br/>
poked through the water and muck hoping to find it and looked around <br/>
the area just in case it had been dragged away or somesuch. No such <br/>
luck. Bummer, especially since there was a bonus box advertised. Ah <br/>
well - we were the only people around, so it was a nice walk.<br/>
<br/>
Little Dragonfly and Pemi Trail boxes -- Both in place and in great <br/>
shape. Miss Buggy had fun trying to decide if the large boulder <br/>
mentioned in the Pemi Trail clues *really* was as tall as Nana if she <br/>
stood on Pop's shoulders. :-)</div>
