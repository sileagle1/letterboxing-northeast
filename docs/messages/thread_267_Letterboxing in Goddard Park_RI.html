Had a little time this weekend to go letterboxing and found two boxes <br/>
in Goddard Park. The Pony Club Box is alive and well. The Pirates <br/>
Past Noon LB is in need of some TLC, One journal is full but someone <br/>
left a new one also the stamp has been broken. I've also driven the <br/>
Lime Green Punch Buggie HH to another state.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone has a great time at the winter gathering. I was <br/>
planning on attending but got a call yesterday from the Blackstone <br/>
Valley Park Service looking for help from my scouts on a river clean <br/>
up for the same date. I'll be thinking of you as we hall 2000 tires <br/>
out of the Blackstone.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1277169653">It's funny you said that.  I started letterboxing on the first day of spring last year with an accidental letterbox find on the Blackstone Bike Path and 75 finds to date haven't looked back.  I have plans on placing two boxes along the river this year.  One will be at the location of the old Lonsdale Drive-In. I was the land surveyor that helped turn it from a abandon drive-in, to a nature wetland with a lagoon and two islands. There now laying out a new section of the bike path.<br/>
<br/>
Oh to Brian of Team Green Dragon, I got my dates crossed the river clean up is Saturday so I'll be coming to the gathering.<br/>

See you there<br/>
