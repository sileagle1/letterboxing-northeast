and in good shape and Father's Day Flowers has now been refreshed.  The ink <br/>
pad was totally dry and didn't work so I took it out.  Nothing in the box was <br/>
in baggies, so Moonstone and I refreshed it, taking home the totally soaked <br/>
logbook, and replacing it with a new one, with a baggie.  The Roses boxes were in <br/>
good shape also.  We also found an unpublished box at the first big section <br/>
of slickrock on the way up the mountain on the Blue trail (not at top).  If you <br/>
go to the right off trail and find a downed tree, underneath the roots is a <br/>
box.  Moonstone found it the last time she was there because she thought she <br/>
was at the top of the mountain.  There's not a lookout there, but just a large <br/>
patch of slickrock.  If you get there soon, there may be an added surprise ;-)<br/>

Happy Hunting!<br/>
