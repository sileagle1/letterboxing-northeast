Another reason I box is to show them that I appreciate their efforts by looking for the box.  Tried as we could, we couldn't get very many boxes at the MMM.  I was very disappointed that I couldn't see everyone's work.<br/>

  Subject: [UBE?] [LbNE] MMM Box Makers Share the Art Program<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  We are putting together a MMM Share the Art program. I have made scans of all the monster stamp images that were a part of the MMM. All scans will be available for viewing on my web site. The "Monster Makers List" will have a link going to the scanned image of each individual monster. If any of the box makers do not want their stamps image displayed, contact me and I will leave it off. If I hear nothing, it will be available for viewing. .....Chuck and Molly<br/>
