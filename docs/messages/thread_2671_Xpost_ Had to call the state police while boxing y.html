<br/>
I was going North on Route 201 in North Stonington yesterday, going <br/>
around a curve, and have to come to a SCREECHING halt!  Why you <br/>
ask??????<br/>
<br/>
Well, there was a horse in the road.  And it wouldn't move.  Since <br/>
I'm afraid of horses, I wasn't going to get out of the car.  And the <br/>
horse was begging to get hit by a car.  Every once in a while, the <br/>
horse would go over to the side of the road and graze, and when a <br/>
car came whizzing by, it would freak out and run BACK INTO the <br/>
street.  Well, I couldn't let that happen, so I called 911.<br/>
<br/>
The conversation went something like this:  "911 What is your <br/>
emergency?"<br/>
<br/>
"Well officer, there's a horse in the road."<br/>
<br/>
"A horse in the road."<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, and it grazes on the side of the road, and whenever a car goes <br/>
whizzing by, it freaks out and runs back into the road."<br/>
<br/>
"Where's your location?"<br/>
<br/>
"Route 201 in North Stonington.  Would you like a house #?"<br/>
<br/>
"No.  I'll have to patch you into State Police." (patch happens)<br/>
<br/>
"State Police, what's your emergency."<br/>
<br/>
"There's a horse in the road."<br/>
<br/>
"A Horse in the road?"<br/>
<br/>
"Yes."<br/>
<br/>
"I see that you're on Route 201.  Are you on the North Stonington <br/>
side or Griswold side?"  (I guess they come from different barracks <br/>
or something)<br/>
<br/>
"I don't know."<br/>
<br/>
"Did you go by some sharp curves in the road?"<br/>
<br/>
"No."<br/>
<br/>
"OK, we'll send someone out to you.  Do you know where the horse <br/>
came from?"  (Like I even live anywhere near North Stonington)<br/>
<br/>
"No.  It was in the middle of the road."<br/>
<br/>
"OK, we'll send someone out."<br/>
<br/>
Well, so I sat there, waiting, and waiting, and waiting, hoping that <br/>
this horse didn't get hit in the process.  I kept flashing my lights <br/>
at oncoming traffic, and my brake lights at traffic coming behind <br/>
me.  Not that it deterred people from going by at 50 mph and <br/>
freaking out the horse again.  Thankfully, a lady stopped, who <br/>
actually had horses, and was able to keep the horse semi-occupied, <br/>
while we waited.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the cop got there (who I don't think knew anything about <br/>
horses btw), and I'm hoping that he found a way to find the owners <br/>
of the horse, since there wasn't a house around that looked like it <br/>
had stables or anything.  <br/>
<br/>
Another interesting day of letterboxing!<br/>

Got a crick in my neck, watching as he passed by...  You never forget these sights when they happen!  Now there's some horse power for you!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1262597100">Loved your telling of this story!  I've never had horses in the road <br/>
but last spring I did stop and flash my lights while watching 5 deer <br/>
trot down the opposite side of Route 102 here on the Island.  I kept <br/>
thinking they'd get scared and leap into the woods, but the last I saw <br/>
of them in my rear view they were still headed south in the road.  <br/>
There is no hunting here on the Island so we have a lot of deer and <br/>
some of them are getting pretty brazen these days.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Same barracks, but Route 201 has 2 seperate sections (Route 2 up <br/>
Cossaduck hill and then Route 2 to the Stonington line).<br/>
<br/>
You'd actually be suprised how many calls come in for stuff like this. <br/>
My personal favorite is:  "Hi, This is Mrs. (So-and-so) and I'm getting <br/>
ready to have a pool party for my child's birthday. Anyways, I just <br/>
looked outside and there's a horse peeing in my pool....can you come do <br/>
something about it?"  Sooooo we send officers over and sure enough <br/>
there's a horser walking around her pool......<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, they party got postponed until the pool got re-<br/>
chlorinated! <br/>
