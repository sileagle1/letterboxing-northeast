patch... it had crossed over into the Twilight Zone!  Yesterday <br/>
morning I found the Great Pumpkin HH hanging out with that nasty <br/>
monster "To Serve Man" in the Twilight Zone.  I brought the Great <br/>
Pumpkin HH back into this dimension.  The Great Pumpkin HH is now <br/>
happily hanging out with another monster in Mansfield. <br/>
<br/>
I no sooner got the Great Pumpkin HH situated in her new home when I <br/>
found the Touring Turtle HH lurking about the Bates Hotel (very seedy <br/>
Turtle.)  I convinced the turtle to leave the Bates Motel and travel <br/>
with me.  I dropped the Touring Turtle off at another letterbox in <br/>
Mansfield.<br/>
<br/>
All totaled I spent 15 hours hunting monsters on Saturday &amp; Sunday. <br/>
That doesn't include the 3 hour round trip drive each day.  Boy am I <br/>
tired!  Met a lot of great people out on the trail (&amp; in the Country <br/>
Store) and had a chance to box with people from all over New <br/>
England.  As Nov 1 rapidly approaches I worry that I may not be able <br/>
to finish all the Monster Mash boxes (I still have 45 left to find!) <br/>
and my motto is "No monster will be left behind."  So, I continue to <br/>
pray for good weather on the weekends (This last weekend's weather <br/>
was a "10" in my book.) and hope that my aching joints hold up.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Monster Hunting to all,<br/>
