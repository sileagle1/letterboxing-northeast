outside my home before the hunt began (paying bills, making a grocery <br/>

ladned at Mono Pond Park where I'd never been before.  Found <br/>
NeeDeep's "Indiana stamp" (my 6th find of the series) with a <br/>
hitchhiker alongside! Discovered "Mom's Birthday" l.b.on way back to <br/>
car and thought it most sweet and touching.<br/>
  Then I tackled "Sweet Innocents"  a 2 box series by my friends <br/>
Columbian Bugs and Paws across Columbia.  The trail is a soup, I must <br/>
say.  I waded through a swamp, not a vernal pond, to get to box # 1. <br/>
Container dry inside, just replaced wet outside baggie. The trail is <br/>
nice, just be sure to wear above ankle boots in spring time.  Box # 2 <br/>
was gone! I found the spot and saw hiding sticks. Hopefully it was <br/>
pulled for repairs. <br/>
  My last l.b. find was Laurie's (Columbian Bug Lady) Crank-Lebanon <br/>
Letterbox series #4. On my way back to car,met a young man eagerly <br/>
preparing to send a transister (don't know the proper name..) plane <br/>
into flight.<br/>
  It was a peaceful yet productive weekend for me. <br/>

Thanks for the update on our boxes. I will try to get out there some time this week to see where box number two went. i can see that i will need to get it painted before replacing it. <br/>
