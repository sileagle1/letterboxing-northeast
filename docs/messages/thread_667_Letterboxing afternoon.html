McHenry's stand on Jackson St.) I proceded to The Windham Mills <br/>
Heritage Park for Thread City Mills letterbox. While teaching at <br/>
Windham Middle School our team did a walking tour of "the Bridges of <br/>
Windham County as part of a huge interdisciplinary unit, ending with <br/>
a picnic lunch at this new park. Too badi its so torn up right now <br/>
due to installation of new drains, looks like. The stamp is perfect <br/>
and facts on the clue sheet are very interesting. However, retreiving <br/>
and replanting the box is a tad dicey...on to Shelt Falls Preserve in <br/>
Mansfield for a combo. search for NeeDeeps' new box "Mystical <br/>
Legends" and to finally get Cock-A-Doodle-Moo's 4-H series, "Just for <br/>
Kicks and Shelter Falls". At "just for Kicks" I found the "Ramblin <br/>
rose" h.h.!  Next stop: "Mystical".  Wow, is all I gotta say..oh, and <br/>
I would suggest searchers bring a large sheet of plain white paper. <br/>
On to "Falls" which had the replacement stamp plus an dunexplained <br/>
one inside it.  Ah well, free bonus stamp-works for me! Back towards <br/>
home and a quick visit to the "Inn of Winter H.H. Hostel" to leave a <br/>
giftie and find a giftie.<br/>
 Hopefully lots of you got out today too.<br/>
