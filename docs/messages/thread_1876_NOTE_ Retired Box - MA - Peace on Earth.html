                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1982977914">Speaking of retired letterboxes. I have a question about a letterbox. I am wondering about the letterbox at Wolf's Den (Pomfret, CT?). It was the one with 22 letterboxes. Believe it or not, this was my first letterboxing experience back in JUly, my mom dragged me along, I didn't know what I was getting into...Who knew it would become an obsession??? Anyway, I only got part of the way through it because we started late in the day, and  I wanted to go back and finish, but I can't find the clues on line. Did this one retire? Any info would be a great help!<br/>
