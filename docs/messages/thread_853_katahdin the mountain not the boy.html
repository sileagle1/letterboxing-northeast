I think we are taking the boy to Katahdin (the mountain) this summer <br/>
to hike him to the top of his namesake (while he is still light <br/>
enough to carry).  Perhaps we should plant a little something while <br/>
we are there.  Something to think about...<br/>

</span></blockquote>You know, as much as I'd love to see a letterbox up there, it's <br/>
really not in tune with the nature of the park.  For a place without <br/>
running water at the campsite, no paved roads, no pay phones, no <br/>
flush toilets, and pets aren't allowed (even if they stay in the car <br/>
the whole time, as I understand it), they take the 'leave nature to <br/>
its own course' extremely seriously.  I've never asked them about <br/>
letterboxing or geocaching at Baxter, but I've got a hunch that they <br/>
wouldn't approve.  And while I might not have much respect for <br/>
national parks at times, I'd be hesitant to plant boxes at Katahdin.<br/>
<br/>
First, it's more fun when you don't have to sneak around to do it, <br/>
and second, this is the only place I know where nature really comes <br/>
first, and I'd love to see it stay that way.  Places like national <br/>
parks irritate me because they talk a lot about nature, but sheeze, <br/>
then they have roads, and bulldozers, and leaf blowers, and, well, it <br/>
seems like they're setting the area for tourists to play, not as a <br/>
place to protect nature.  Baxter I've got to respect a great deal, <br/>
because there, tourists are clearly the second-class citizens.  Wish <br/>
there were more places like that.  *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
But hey, hiding boxes along the way to the park, before you actually <br/>
enter it, would be a nice.  =)<br/>

obsessed-ok-addicted-letterboxer, I would like to add my comment to this thread.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, it is a holy land in the sense that people from Maine are able to use this <br/>
land that Governor Percival Baxter set aside. He was a generous and kind man that <br/>
also cared very deeply for the land. <br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I don't know the land-use issue/argument, I do know that there is some <br/>
concern that the Burts Bees conglomerate and the woman that owns it might turn <br/>
the entire North Wioods into the next tacky National Park...<br/>
<br/>
All that aside, Baxter is very very special and deserves to be enjoyed by all and <br/>
preserved for by all. When I go to Baxter to hike and enjoy nature, letterboxing is <br/>
pretty far from my mind.<br/>
