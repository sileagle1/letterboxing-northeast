I know this subject has been brought up before, but being as next <br/>
weekend will be the last for "Mashing", just a reminder to be safe <br/>
and well prepared out on the trails.  Mom of 3 and I hit the trails <br/>
very early this Saturday morning, and after being treated to the <br/>
company of three beautiful deer out behind Lions Memorial Park, we <br/>
met up with &lt;drumroll&gt;  the hunters!  No, we did not have on our <br/>
brilliant neon orange attire &lt;tsk tsk&gt;, not thinking we were in open <br/>
territory.  The hunters explained that they were not hunting deer, <br/>
but pheasant!  As we were walking the same trail, they (and their <br/>
assorted muddy canine companions) assured us that they'd be on the <br/>
lookout for "boxers" in the woods and thanked us for the heads up.  <br/>
They did encourage us to wear orange, and asked that we pass their <br/>
plea on to fellow boxers because although they hunted cautiously, <br/>
they told us many do not.  We met up with "the hunters" several <br/>
times throughout the morning, and what might have been an <br/>
unfortunate experience turned into an enlightening and educational <br/>
one.  So, as the final days of Mashing fast approach us, please be <br/>
aware that more than Monsters lurk in the Mansfield woods!  <br/>
Now, let's BOX!!  MayEve</div>
