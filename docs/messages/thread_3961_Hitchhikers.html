<br/>
You can get all the answers to your questions right on Atlasquest.com.  Click on home and glossary and everything is in alphabetical order by name.  You can learn about personal travelers and more.  You can also click on letterboxes search for hitch hikers to see if it is registered.  This is a good way to keep track of your finds and to notify the originator that the HH is traveling around safely.  The first one you mentioned was listed, but I couldn't find the second one.  Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
