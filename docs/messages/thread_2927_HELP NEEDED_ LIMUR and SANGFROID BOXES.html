So true. When we found it all the previous entries said things like "this  <br/>
was our third time back". I don't think this one was in any kind of danger from  <br/>
floods. Definitely a nice place.<br/>

<br/>
  I didn't go to check on the boxes until Saturday as we had more pouring rain on Friday-<br/>
AARRGGGHHHHH!<br/>
  But yesterday was sunny and warm and I'm happy to say that Chain, Chain, Chain is snug <br/>
as a little bug in it's wonderful hiding place. The last visitor did a fine job of rehiding I'm <br/>
pleased to say. Oak Hill is in perfect shape as well. I didn't go to Yeat yet but it's way <br/>
above the water line. I'm going to plant one of mine today so I'll visit them and contact you  <br/>
if there's a problem. No news will mean good news! <br/>
<br/>
The river has receded and things are back to normal for most folks.  The National Guard is <br/>
down on Plum Island hauling out tons of garbage that floated down the river and landed <br/>
there. Things as far away as Goffstown, NH! I'd like to see that but I'm sure they're not <br/>
allowing anyone near there. <br/>
<br/>
Well, I can't wait for your visit in June and the little "souvenirs" you're leaving behind!!!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>

&gt; haven't gone after <br/>
&gt; &gt; Quascasunquen yet. But I do know the spot very well, which is half<br/>
&gt; the battle. I love the <br/>
&gt; &gt; views from there! <br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm off to Newburyport and will get back about the Chain, Chain,<br/>
&gt; Chain box for sure. That's <br/>
&gt; &gt; the box that took me three times to find! But it was so cool once I<br/>
&gt; did find it. Can't wait to <br/>
&gt; &gt; see what you'll be leaving behind after your trip in June!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Take care, Orion<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you so much! I was going to email you if no one responded here.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; You have already been so helpful to me! Do you mean Sangfroid's<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; "Enchufe" or "quascacunquen"...I assumed you meant the first. Have you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; found quascacunquen yet? People seem to be having some trouble<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tracking it down.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks again!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'll be going to Newburyport tomorrow and would be happy to check<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on: Chain, Chain, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chain, YEAT!, The spanish one (you know which one I mean but I can't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; spell!) and Oak Hill. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't think the river came up to the level of Chain, Chain, Chain.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The Merrimack is <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; awfully wide though. It's an amazing sight to see. One I hope never<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to see again!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Good news- water levels are going down and the sun's out. Yay!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are way up here in downeast Maine and are worried about our<br/>
&gt; Mass<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boxes due to massive rains and flooding (specifically those in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Amesbury/Newburyport area) Is there anyone willing to check on<br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for us? We won't be getting down there until mid-June and are<br/>
&gt; worried<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about 1 in particular (chain chain chain).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If anyone could check on some or all of the following we would be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eternally grateful!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chain, chain, chain<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeat (which was moved due to cutting and I need to repost clues)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oak Hill Cemetery<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Enchufe del Fuego<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quascacunquen (should be OK but good to check)<br/>
