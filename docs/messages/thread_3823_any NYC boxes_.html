<br/>
It's hard to keep any box going in NYC, due to high rate of boxes  <br/>
taken.  My son and I have found the two boxes at the boat basin,  <br/>
which is within reasonable distance of the Museum of Natural  <br/>
History.  The first box is very small, and I almost missed it, but my  <br/>
son spotted it.  We did find one box in central park (Charlie  <br/>
Chaplin), but later found out that the box had been retired and was  <br/>
about to be dismantled.  There's a great one near Union Square in a  <br/>
costume store called Halloween Adventure.  It's a fun store, and the  <br/>
box/book are specially themed to match.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps!<br/>
