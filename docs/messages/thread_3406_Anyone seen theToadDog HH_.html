personal stamp was released in Oct as a HH.  ToadDog died after a <br/>
brief illness in Sept. and we decided to release his stamp.  There <br/>
have been no posts on the HH page or tracking site by Pete.  If you <br/>
have seen him wagging his tail, please email us at <a href="mailto:Njks919@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Njks919@...</a><br/>
thanks, Sunshine</div>
