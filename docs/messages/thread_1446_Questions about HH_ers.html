do's and don't's?  For example, can I place a HH in my own box, or <br/>
should it be in someone else's LB?  And when you find one, do you stamp the <br/>
HH's stamp in your log book, as well as the LB you were originally <br/>
looking for?<br/>
<br/>
Lastly..when you place one, do you put a note in it, telling the <br/>
person's who find it to tell you where they place it, so you can keep track <br/>
of it?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch!!<br/>

answer all of your HH questions (as well as a few you didn't even know you <br/>
had):<br/>
