Sadie, Russ , Lobsta Lady , Bluebird , Music Woman, Northstar and I<br/>

She also taught us a thing or two about coloring our  hand carved<br/>

expensive that hunting for treasures in antique malls!)  When you <br/>
visit CT there is no such thing as a "little walk" in the woods.  <br/>
They had me up and down hills and thru streams and all but swinging <br/>
from the trees.  I'll be back.<br/>
