a couple of Phyto's boxes at Laudholm Farm, in Wells, hidden well and <br/>
re-hidden. We didn't find Mt A. or Otter in The Pines, but this <br/>
doesn't mean they are not there, since we know we often have to <br/>
search more than once for a box.  We didn't take a hint and so <br/>
mysteriously walked by at least one opportunity.  Then we found the <br/>
HH Hostel in Wells, so took one and left one. Everyone in Wells is <br/>
just Wicked Nice.  :)<br/>
