<br/>
We went letterboxing today at Bird Park in Walpole, MA. The first box we found was fine. The second and third were exposed. The ferns around one were so trampled it was obvious there was a path leading to it and the box was not covered up behind the tree. We rehid it well but we couldn't really do too much about the ferns. <br/>
<br/>
The third box we found was behind its tree. Not a single leaf, rock or twig on top of it! It was totally exposed. We rehid this well also. <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to remind old and new alike to rehide very well. I know this has been written many times before but I have never experienced such blatant disregard for rehiding as I did today and it was very discouraging. The last person there was there yesterday! <br/>

<br/>
P.S. I did notify the placers of all the boxes we found through the LBNA site. <br/>

finding the box and rehiding it well, I got an email from the <br/>
caretaker at Bird Park.  Basically they said the box was left out in <br/>
the open and not very well hid and would I check on it more <br/>
frequently.  It doesn't take much to push some leaves, twigs, and <br/>
other Earthly matter onto a box to hide it.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a feeling its boxers allowing their kids to rehide the boxes.  <br/>
I have been teaching my daughter about the importance of rehiding.  <br/>
We usually do it together to be sure its done well. Then we walk <br/>
around to make sure there is anything that would give away the <br/>
location of the box.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is that we each take the time to teach our younger <br/>
boxers how to rehide properly and why it is important.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing!<br/>
