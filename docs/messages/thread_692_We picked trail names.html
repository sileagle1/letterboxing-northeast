Gatherer" and "PowWow Dancer" for myself and Brad.  !  Our 'family' <br/>
will be known as the "Dawn Landers".  I had great fun yesterday <br/>
carving a stamp for each of us, and we look forward to our first <br/>
official stamping of a box.  Sp be looking for our stamps around <br/>
Mansfield!<br/>
<br/>
The Mansfield event in October sounds great, and is just down (up?) <br/>
the road from us! we will be sure to attend, and if we are confident <br/>
enough of our boxing abilities would like to offer a box for the <br/>
monster event.<br/>
