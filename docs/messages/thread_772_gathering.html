There are just too many ifs for me to drive 3.5 hours out of the way <br/>
to a meeting then back, then do it again the next day.  I had 2 <br/>
gathering rookies who were dying for the experience..I made <br/>
arrangements for a tent and everything..and I didn't procrastinate <br/>
for once..that'll teach me to be on top of things.  I guess we'll <br/>
see you in Sharon?  Have fun and be careful.<br/>
