                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-66320210">Thanks to the encouragement of a fellow poster I went back for <br/>
the "Pine For You" letterbox and found it this time! As for the newly <br/>
replaced "Opening Day"..that's another story.  Where is that darned <br/>
fallen tree?? I shall return!!  I spent some time at Wolf Rock, <br/>
stamping into a few boxes right behind Mama Fox.  Too bad we did not <br/>
meet on the trail.  "Inky Fingers" is really cute, and a clever idea <br/>
to dedicate a box to this common side affect of l.b.ing.  On to my <br/>
very first find in the fine new Peanuts series by the Maplines.  <br/>
Thanks for the background info. on our favorite comic <br/>
series.  "Schroeder" was playing a fine classic piano piece as I <br/>
opened the box. Outer bag already has a busted zipper, so if anyone <br/>
plans to visit soon perhaps you could bring a large sized ziplock <br/>
bag? My repair kit did not have a suitable sized one. On to "Wild <br/>
Black Bagels". Curses, foiled again!! A very pleasant young couple <br/>
were busily setting up their gear to go rockclimbing off the side of <br/>
Wolf Rock. I hung for a few minutes asking about their hobby then <br/>
returned to my car.  To repeat, I shall return!!<br/>
