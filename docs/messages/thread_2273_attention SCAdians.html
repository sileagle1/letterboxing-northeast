We try to combine the two hobbies by looking for boxes on the way to or from Events. This year we're hoping to again attend the big Pennsic War in Western Pennsylvania. We're printing off clues for the counties along the route and hope to get a few boxes along the way.  Unfortunately the War itself does not allow daytrippers and can be kind of expensive if you're not attending the War, but if there are any other people crazy enough to be both Letterboxers and SCAdians attending the War - we would love to meet up with you. We will be camping with Aleholding in the Highlands and will at least have a stamp or two to share with any Letterboxers who find us.<br/>
