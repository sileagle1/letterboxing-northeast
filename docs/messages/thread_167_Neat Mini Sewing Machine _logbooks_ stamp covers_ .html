sewing machine under our Christmas tree this year. It is made by <br/>
ProvoCraft and called the Sew Crafty Mini. Stands about 6 or 7 inches <br/>
high and offers a single stitch pattern. It uses 4 AA batteries and <br/>
really zips through both fabric and paper.  We've been experimenting <br/>
with it for logbook binding.  Managed to make some neat rough copies <br/>
of books with it, and also used those fancy ruffle edged scissors. <br/>
<br/>
I think the mini sewer runs about $14 at most craft stores (I think <br/>
this one came from AC Moore).<br/>

Hey, that sounds like fun. Is it totally portable?<br/>
<br/>
If you come to the 29th gathering, please bring it. If you don't want<br/>
to stitch by hand, it might be a great opportunity to try it out. The<br/>
only drawback is that felt is thick. I don't stitch felt on my machine<br/>
anymore as it can really do a number on a regular sewing machine...<br/>

Thanks for sharing this great info!</div>
