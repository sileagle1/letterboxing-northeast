<br/>
As some of you may have read on our webpage during the past 6 months, <br/>
one of our dreams has been boxing at Dartmoor. I have previously <br/>
received quite a few emails of interested parties who would take an <br/>
organized trip with us after I posted such.<br/>
<br/>
This is what I know so far: <br/>
<br/>
Mid to late September works best for Sue and I [plus it's our 30th <br/>
Anniversary and wanted to take a big trip.] The weather in England in <br/>
September is similar to our September weather, not too hot - not too <br/>
cold.<br/>
<br/>
Boxing at Dartmoor is much different than from the US. Clues are <br/>
based on maps with coordinates and with over 10,000 boxes located <br/>
there we can really expand on our F's! We are open to ideas, like <br/>
leaving a bunch of letterboxes there. I have thought about an evening <br/>
gathering with some local letterboxers at a pub and maybe spending <br/>
the next day boxing with the experts - in fact - that might be a good <br/>
way to begin the week. Members of the Dartmoor Yahoo talk list have <br/>
offered to organize such an event for us if we want. Their advice <br/>
would truly prove invaluable.<br/>
<br/>
London's Heathrow Airport is about 2.5 hours away from Dartmoor - <br/>
there are 2 other closer airports [Exeter &amp; Plymouth] but I'm not <br/>
sure what kind of deals will be available for those more obscure <br/>
airports. I will check on that in the coming weeks. We are a member <br/>
of Bestfares.com and there is a Bradley Airport to Heathrow special <br/>
running through April for $368 round trip. You have to be a member of <br/>
this website but I am willing to coordinate that so we can all <br/>
achieve the best deal if they extend this offer through the fall. I <br/>
would think otherwise $500 per person should be a good budgetary <br/>
starting point for airfare {I probably was a travel agent in a past <br/>
life!]<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed that if we have 10 or more people there will be a <br/>
group discount possibly on airfare and surely on accommodations. Our <br/>
plan is to stay 1 week [either 6 or 7 nights.] Spend most of the week <br/>
letterboxing [either full or half days] and allowing a day or 2 for <br/>
local sightseeing, pubs, museums, pubs, maybe a day in London, and <br/>
some pubs!!! Our daily itinerary can be left up to the majority <br/>
wishes of the group.<br/>
<br/>
There are 2 major ways we can have accommodations:<br/>
1] Bed &amp; Breakfast - private rooms with full English breakfast and <br/>
overnight runs approx. $50 - $60 US for the night per person based on <br/>
double occupancy. You singles may want to pair up with another <br/>
single. That can be planned later. Some B &amp; B's even offer an upgrade <br/>
for full 4 to 5 course meals for supper and the option to pack a <br/>
bagged lunch that we can take with us while exploring the moors.<br/>
<br/>
2]Self catering - which means you rent a cottage with full kitchen <br/>
and bedrooms but WE do the cooking. That would save us quite a bit of <br/>
money but do we want to have breakfast ready for us in the AM? I <br/>
found a great spot on the internet that was a former horse stable, <br/>
made of brick dating to the 1800's. It has been transformed into <br/>
quaint "cottages" with full kitchens, etc. There are 2 that will <br/>
sleep 2 people, 1 that sleeps 4, another that sleeps 6 and another <br/>
that sleeps 8 to 12.<br/>
<br/>
All of the accommodations to which I am referring are located either <br/>
in or just outside of Darmoor Park. My concern is to save traveling <br/>
time from our homebase to the letterboxes!!<br/>
<br/>
That's about all I have worked up so far. In the next week I plan to <br/>
update our webpage with a new subpage for this trip along with some <br/>
links to Dartmoor websites, B &amp; B's, etc. This is still in the <br/>
planning stages and not quite definite yet, but I thought this would <br/>
be a good time to get things started.<br/>
<br/>
Please email me if you are interested. I believe we can do the <br/>
complete trip for about $1000 to 1200 per person including airfare <br/>
and accommodation and if we choose a B &amp; B, that would include full <br/>
breakfast and possibly dinner. Spending money, additional meals of <br/>
course would exceed that amount.<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested and the dates work for you, please email me at: <br/>

<br/>
I assume that Bradley Airport in CT is a central location and will <br/>
continue to look at airfare from there. <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to hearing from all of you soon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there and [Darmoor] box!!!<br/>

help you with the details but I do know enough to tell you that you <br/>
want to fly into one of the London airports, preferably Heathrow.  If <br/>
you fly out of Boston (which really is not that far, just take one of <br/>
the Logan Express buses in) you have your choice of a morning or <br/>
evening non-stop to Heathrow on a few different airlines.  Flights <br/>
there go down to under $300 (including all taxes, etc) from Nov to <br/>
March.  You will still be paying a high rate if you go in Sep (as <br/>
much as twice).  <br/>
<br/>
If you decide not to drive then you can take the Heathrow Express <br/>
into Paddington Station (think Paddington Bear), which coincidentally <br/>
is the station that the trains for that part of England depart from <br/>
(the Great Western line).  <br/>
<br/>
If you decide to drive, remember that it is on the "wrong" side of <br/>
the road and you will be driving a standard car.  Automatics are 2 - <br/>
3x as expensive to rent.  Driving in the remote parts of England is <br/>
definitely an experience.<br/>
