recent illnesses and accidents, so we headed out on the trail <br/>
yesterday. Of course, with the snow and leaves, things were slippery, <br/>
so we're sore from slipping on slopes and turning ankles on hidden <br/>
rocks, but we had a ball!<br/>
<br/>
We found Grafton Lakes State Park - #3+4 of the series. We made it as <br/>
far as the picnic area before the beach before my daughter decided <br/>
she'd had enough, so #1+2 will have to wait for another day - just as <br/>
well as the lake was gorgeous now and we can't wait to see it in <br/>
springtime. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we were 3rd finders on both boxes and both were in good shape. <br/>
The ink pad in #3 is somewhat dry, but since most of us hike with ink, <br/>
that's no big deal. Bags and boxes and hiding places are all intact.<br/>
<br/>
Box on!<br/>
