On April 23-25, 3004 Blackstone Valley District will be holding a <br/>
Earthday Camporee along the Blackstone River in Cumberland, RI.  <br/>
During the day of Saturday April 24th our activities will consist of <br/>
a river &amp; bike path clean up till noon. After that we're looking for <br/>
some clinics put on by different outdoor organizations. I'm sorry <br/>
about the short notice, we didn't have a go ahead by the town of <br/>
Cumberland till now.  During the event there will by 12 letterboxes <br/>
hidden with the 12 parts of the scout law. If anyone is interested in <br/>
Running a clinic on letterboxing please contact me. <br/>
<br/>
Thank You<br/>
