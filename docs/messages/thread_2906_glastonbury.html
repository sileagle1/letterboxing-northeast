fun day.  This was the first gather that I stayed inside and did not go <br/>
out hunting !! It was fun to visit and just relax and meet a few new <br/>
friends and greet my old buddies. My grand daughter had a blast at her <br/>
first gather .She felt so welcome and enjoyed meeting all the <br/>
letterboxing people I constantly e mail her about . :-D Now she knows <br/>
why I love you all.<br/>
Happy trails to all<br/>
