<br/>
Thanks for all your enthusiasm for Girl Scout Cookies!  Based of a series of question that have been repeating in the e-mails I'm receiving this morning, I've updated the web page for The Great Cookie Caper.  Since many of the inquiries were from out of county and out of state, I thought it only fair to give you a little more info... weather conditions... accessibility.... I won't tell you where it is, but I'll tell you where it ain't!<br/>
