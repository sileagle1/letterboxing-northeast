to wallingford. The box that you couldn't find is still in it's <br/>
place. What seems to have happened, is some local animals sort of <br/>
buried it, so you must have felt the dirt and thought the box was <br/>
gone. I moved it back to the top of the pile. All you have to do is <br/>
reach in and to the left. If you remember the tree, it'll be a much <br/>
shorter trip this time around. Happy trails!!  --Northstar</div>
