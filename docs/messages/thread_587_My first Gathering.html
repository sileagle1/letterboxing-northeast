something.  YOU WILL BE TOTALLY OVERWHELMED BY THE EXPERIENCE!  When you get <br/>
there, you want to exchange with everyone you meet!  Also, bring as many <br/>
personal traveler clues as you can!  It seems as though personal travelers <br/>
are becoming very common and make sure you have them in some sort of order <br/>
(alphabetical or something) so you can thumb through them easily when you <br/>
find who you're looking for.  Or, write on a separate piece of paper, the <br/>
people who have personal travelers and check them off as you find them.<br/>
<br/>
Expect to have anywhere between 50-100 exchanges by the end of the day.  I <br/>
believe this will be a large gather, so just be prepared to be totally <br/>
overwhelmed.  Sometimes people also bring hitchhikers to the event for <br/>
others to stamp in.  Bluebird and Butterfly usually don't stamp in, and <br/>
rather stamp in on the trail, however, sometimes I find a couple that I <br/>
really want in my book and stamp in (being that I've stamped into over 130 <br/>
hitchhikers, I usually have most of them).<br/>
<br/>
Also, bring food to share, if you can ;-) and drinks for yourself, unless <br/>
they are being provided.  And, lastly, HAVE A GREAT TIME!  I will see you <br/>
there!<br/>

</span></blockquote>While gatherings can be VERY overwhelming (the biggest one I went to <br/>
was the POE event, an estimated 75-80 people, maybe more?), it is <br/>
nice to get everybody to exchange but it's not necessary.  We got a <br/>
tremendous amount of exchanges, but we didn't get a chance to meet <br/>
everyone at the event.<br/>
<br/>
I hope we can get there early, set up shop in one place and let the <br/>
crowds come to us...heehee.</div>

<br/>
A personal traveler is a stamp that is carried around by letterboxers <br/>
that is usually handcarved.  In addition to exchanging with them with <br/>
their trail stamp, many letterboxers carry a personal traveler <br/>
(a.k.a. P.T.) and you usually have to either recite a line, sing a <br/>
song, or whisper a secret answer in their ear and you can recieve <br/>
their traveler...different letterboxers have different tasks for you <br/>
to do in order to get their P.T. - and some people may have more than <br/>
one!</div>
