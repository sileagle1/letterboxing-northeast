                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1511872601">We hunted all the boxes in Westborough and Shrewsbury, MA this past <br/>
Sunday.  All were found, but a number were not well hidden.  One was <br/>
sitting on top of the rock wall it was supposed to be under.  We <br/>
noted that a number of the other boxes poorly hidden in addition to <br/>
this one fully exposed had recently been hunted by the same <br/>
letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
Rehide those boxes, people!<br/>
<br/>
Boxes found:<br/>
Walkup Reservation<br/>
Peace on Earth  &lt;-- a great spot!<br/>
Time to go Fishin'<br/>
Bizarre Beetle<br/>
Crazy Caterpillar<br/>
Silly Spider<br/>
Idi Amin (Hitchhiker)<br/>
Table in the Woods<br/>
Flying Hippo<br/>
Bouncy Bug<br/>
<br/>
Also, we're curious about the Idi Amin hitchhiker by Legerdemaine.  <br/>
Is this part of a series of "Evil Dictators" HHs?  We found it odd <br/>
that anyone would memoralize a man like Amin.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Yep - that's part of the series Legerdemaine created.  There's a <br/>
whole bunch of 'em, like Castro, Pol Pot, Hitler, Stalin, and the <br/>
like.  This HH also passed through either Cry Baby or Boxes 1 or 2 of <br/>
Danielle's 15th.<br/>
