These are from two days after Thanksgiving when we went to plant Trish's third Viking Ships at Sunrise box.  Both Trish and Warrior Woman posted on the LbNA list the story about how people had reported the first and second boxes missing, and what we found when we went to plant the box for Trish.  <br/>
