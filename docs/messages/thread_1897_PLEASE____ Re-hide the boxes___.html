I hope the right people see this. <br/>
<br/>
I went out with my two boys today and found two boxes. "Sad Bug" and<br/>
"Spiraling Tree", both in Plainville MA.<br/>
<br/>
Neither box was rehidden when I found them. The first, "Sad Bug" was<br/>
supposed to be in a hole in a foundation wall, nestled next to a tree,<br/>
hidden by a round rock. It was all there but the rock was left 3' from<br/>
the box. <br/>
<br/>
The second, "Spiraling Tree," is located only 50' or so from the main<br/>
road of a cemetary and was supposed to be found hidden "next to" a<br/>
boulder. It was ther all right. Just sitting there in it's plastic bag<br/>
right next to the boulder clearly visible from 100' away. I could see<br/>
where the placers had carefully made a shallow depression and laid<br/>
several sticks and leaves to hide the box, but the last finder made no<br/>
effort whatsoever. <br/>
<br/>
From the logs it appears that the same person(S) were the last to see<br/>
both boxes before me, sometime in January. <br/>
<br/>
Pass the word along, apparently some people haven't gotten the hint yet.<br/>
<br/>
I rehid them more carefully but just wanted to give the head's up.</div>

boxes of the Homer Bound series in Hopkinton, given the proximity.  I <br/>
found the *exact* same thing.<br/>
