  It was suggested we post our route on our trip. I think we'll be <br/>
  taking I-95 won't we? <br/>

definitely consider adding them to your list. And afterwards, stop in<br/>
at Greta's Great Grains for some delectable treats to enjoy as you<br/>
continue your drive.<br/>

I-95)to Rt. 3 North which turns into NH Rt. 3 (Edward Everett <br/>
Parkway) to I-89 all the way.  Once you cross I-91 in White River <br/>
Junction start looking for Rt. 4 (Quechee/Woodstock) exit.  It might <br/>
even be the next one.  Be careful not to take any Rt. 4 exits till <br/>
after you cross over I-91.  (It must run parallel or something as <br/>
there are I think two Rt. 4's before I-91 as well as the one you want <br/>
after it).<br/>
