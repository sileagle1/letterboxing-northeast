Well, I found part of it, the 'box has been vandalized. :(  I found the stamp-pad tossed into a crevice and some searching farther back in the cave turned up the stamp.  However I was not able to find any sign of the log or container. The stamp is fine (great stamp, too), the pad was trashed.<br/>
<br/>
I have attempted to contact Carolyn via LbNA's "contact placer" but it has not worked for me in the past.  I'd like to return the stamp to her if she wants it.  OTOH, if someone from her "maintenance crew" wants to replant it for her...<br/>
