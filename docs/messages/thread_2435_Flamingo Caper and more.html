of it and are just now getting home.<br/>
<br/>
First, a big THANK YOU to everyone involved in helping out with this <br/>
event. This was only our second gathering, but we had an absolute ball. <br/>
All of the actors were great and my daughter enjoyed them so much that <br/>
she asked for autographs from those who showed up to the party <br/>
afterwards. lol. The Pink Panther kids were awesome! And BOY did our <br/>
exchange count go up! It was really fun to meet so many of you.<br/>
<br/>
We stayed one more night at the Super 8 (never again... the manager <br/>
tried to overcharge us for the room and was *amazingly* condescending <br/>
when I insisted on paying what was on my original sheet...... the one <br/>
dark spot on our weekend) then switched to another hotel for last night <br/>
and spent Sunday out on the Rail Trail getting the Build Your Own <br/>
Burger series, the Dave's Fave's series, and Everybody Loves Ginger. <br/>
All stamps and boxes seemed to be in great shape, though a couple of <br/>
inkpads may need replacing after a few more finders. My poor old knee <br/>
barely made it back to our car, but it was worth it and we're <br/>
tantalizingly close to F100 now. :-)<br/>
<br/>
So, the Best Western/Fitchburg was really nice, the rate was as good as <br/>
at the Super 8, and it looked to be right near a nice bit of <br/>
parkland....... maybe another gathering next fall? :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to all who helped even a bit with this gathering. We had a <br/>
wonderful time.<br/>
