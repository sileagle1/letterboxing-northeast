Just COME-- dress for the weather, bring a map if you can get one.  Be <br/>
ready to have a great time.  Bluebird has many treasures for us to <br/>
find.  Lots of great hikes and boxes  there.  You will have a  time to <br/>
remember<br/>

Are you the one who emailed me about the Chatfield Trail? <br/>
(accidentally deleted it!). Trails at Chatfield Hollow State Park <br/>
would be better. Each has some rocks/climbs, but I used to take <br/>
my second/third grade scouts there. Since the gate is closed at <br/>
this time of year, it makes any hike longer. There is a nice nature <br/>
trail, but again, some ups and downs and rocks.<br/>
The Chatfield Trail's last box is missing; I just got its <br/>
replacement made, but it is not out yet. One hiker wrote in the <br/>
now-missing logbook that they saw a ratttler up there, and there <br/>
is a lot of climbing over and through rocks up there!<br/>
Just come to the gather at Chatfield Hollow that Lou and I are <br/>
doing on Nov. 13. Everyone brings a food item to share; I will <br/>
have a big pot of stew and one of vegetable soup. There are <br/>
already lots of boxes there, but there will be a new treasure trail <br/>
with patch "treasure", plus some just for the day, and an event <br/>
stamp. See you then!<br/>
