but #1 had a note attached to the baggie saying thank you for the<br/>
stamp and pad.  It was signed by Sea Girl who said she hoped we would<br/>
enjoy the gifts she left in the box - a sea shell and a couple small<br/>
pieces of beach glass.  Has anyone heard of Sea Girl?  She's probably<br/>
new to letterboxing and hopefully will get the correct information<br/>
soon.  Fortunately, Lady #2 was fine.<br/>
<br/>
Picked up Dopey HH at Blowing in the Wind.  Also found some of the<br/>
House of Mouse series.  Discovered that we had left the last page of<br/>
the clues at home so couldn't complete it.  Couldn't find #2 and 3 of<br/>
that series either.  Did have good luck and a good time at Bog's<br/>
Brownie Boxes.  <br/>

cache.  Anyone know how to get in touch with the geocachers in the local area?</div>
