short time.  Amy, very nice locations.  It was a bit cool today, but <br/>
amazingly, there were many, many, many people out and about.  I guess <br/>
this month really does warrant this many people in this particular location.<br/>
<br/>
The only box that we had to wait to retrieve was the Thanksgiving box.  <br/>
It's location is a favorite to sightseers and tourists, but I believe it <br/>
was successful and hopefully our wait kept the uknowing public away from <br/>
these box locations.  And to top off a great trip, we were first finders <br/>
for a hitchhiker.  :-)<br/>

Happy Hunting<br/>
