 Sounds good Jay , I was going to wait at least until Monday to pull <br/>
the cape off of this .<br/>
Anybody else have ideas ? I'm in no big hurry to go public and it <br/>
would be great to start off with a bang .<br/>
If you know of others that might be interested in signing up , please <br/>
do invite them .<br/>
I'll be away from the computer all weekend and it would be nice to <br/>
have a few more on board come Monday morning .<br/>
Thanks to all of you for joining . <br/>
<br/>

</span></blockquote>What a wickedly clever idea!  =)  I'll have to think on it a bit, but <br/>
please don't depend on me.  I'm very unrealiable when it comes to <br/>
thinking up a clever clue for an existing place.  (I'm much better at <br/>
thinking up a clever clue, then putting a box somewhere to fit the <br/>
location!)<br/>
<br/>
Hmm....  Well, I do have one idea.  I (or someone else--I'm always up <br/>
for others doing my dirty work *wink*) could create a virtual <br/>
letterbox where the image to be printed out would be on this talk <br/>
list in the Files or Photo section.  But I fear many people wouldn't <br/>
find this place because they aren't interested in virtual boxes.  <br/>
(I've never even bothered to look for one myself.)<br/>
<br/>
I could make a clue similar to the Paul Revere box.  Pure torture.  <br/>
Pure evil.  Pure fun.  =)  I must also get a stamp carved for such a <br/>
virtual box.  Unless someone else wants to volunteer?  =)<br/>
