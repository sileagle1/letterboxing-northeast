folks that the newest [ three] boxes put out at the East Lyme High <br/>
school do not have the stamps in the boxes yet. !!  Lobsta and I went <br/>
the other day and found the boxes,  in good shape, with Log books, stamp <br/>
pad,  but all are missing the stamps.  Lobsta contacted the planters and <br/>
has heard from one that the stamps are being carved.  Give these boxes a <br/>
little while so you will not be dissapointed as we were . We live close <br/>
by and will check again .<br/>
