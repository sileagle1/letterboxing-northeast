series entitled "Native American Traditions and Trees" A van in the <br/>
parking area had a LBNA bumper sticker, and sure enough, I followed <br/>
behind Sadie/Russ and Butterfly in discovering this series. Caught up <br/>
with them at # 4. Even though I had skeeters smashed all over me and <br/>
my hair was wild and crazy, these kind letterboxing friends allowed <br/>
me to join their party. What a fun end to the afternoon! Please check <br/>
out the series if at all possible.  The stamps are meticulously <br/>
carved with great detail.<br/>
