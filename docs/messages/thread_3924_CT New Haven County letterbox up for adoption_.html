I will try to help , let me know if there are any down in my neck of the woods.  Of course, I could look it up myself -- dahhh <br/>
I seem to remember there is one at Sleeping Giant as well as Guilford.  Sadie and Russ planted them for Needeeps .  I have boxes on the Giant , so if no one adopts that one , I would help .  sigh-- I miss Needeeps . <br/>

I have a bunch of letterboxes I will be putting up for readoption. I adopted them from The NeeDeeps. If nobody adopts them, I will keep them and try to maintain them but it's going to take a while. I will be putting them up for adoption by county. This is the only one from New Haven County. It is also the furthest away from me.
