old did such a great job at carving a small stamp.  She even took the <br/>
time to make a circle logbook and even sew it together!<br/>
<br/>
Planting and writting out the clues were so much fun!  Now we wait <br/>
patiently to see if anyone can find it.  It is in such a remote area <br/>
that it might be a year or so before it's found.<br/>
<br/>
Quick question... I did the same clues/writting for both AQ &amp; LBNA, but <br/>
didn't link them... is that ok?<br/>

found them.  Enjoy!  Howlingl Wolf<br/>
