Gryphon has been out of boxing for a while but thankfully to alot of <br/>
us her return is imminent....PLus she is a total sweetheart of a <br/>
person, = :0) <br/>
Anyways;<br/>
<br/>
She rescued this letterbox from its "location" before the maintenance <br/>
crew had destroyed it....during Spring grounds cleanup.....<br/>
<br/>
I plan on delivering it to Merewen @ The Art Guru tommorrow. So anyone <br/>
looking for it that is the status as of tonight.......</div>
