<br/>
We have officially taken over the campground!  Out of 17 tent sites, we<br/>
have paid deposits on 11. There are only 6 tent sites left in the entire<br/>
campground and I have 7 people who have expressed an interest but not<br/>
made their deposit.  There are a couple of Trailer sites with<br/>
water/electric available as well.<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in camping out with us, PLEASE let me know ASAP..<br/>
I can only hold the unsecured sites another few days and they are first<br/>
come first served.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to hear from you all soon,<br/>
