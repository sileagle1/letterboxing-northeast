                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2059798547">Today I updated the Take It Easy letterbox in Charlestown, RI with a <br/>
new hand carved stamp and a second log book (the first one was almost <br/>
full.) The clues are still the same. This has been by far the most <br/>
popular of my letterboxes.  (probably because it is only a 5 minute <br/>
walk on level ground.)<br/>
<br/>
If you are out in the Charlestown area, stop by &amp; pick up the new <br/>
stamp image.<br/>
<br/>
Remember: This box is stroller and wheelchair friendly (gravel path <br/>
so need heavy duty wheels.)  No bikes or dogs allowed :(<br/>
