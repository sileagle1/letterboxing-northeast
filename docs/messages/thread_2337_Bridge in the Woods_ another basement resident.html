Bridge in the Woods, located in Trout Brook Conservation Area, Wayland<br/>
MA.  It is alive and very well. It perhaps takes 30 minutes to get to<br/>
the box. Easy hike.;<br/>
<br/>
I have contacted Sudbury Valley Trustees, the owners of the property<br/>
to let them know about the box. SVT has been placing boxes on several<br/>
of their conservation areas and may be willing to adopt this box.<br/>
<br/>
Would love to see the basement emptied.<br/>
