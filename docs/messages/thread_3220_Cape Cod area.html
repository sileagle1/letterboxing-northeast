California but we just returned from a lovely vacation out there and have a few boxes we think you should not miss.<br/>
<br/>
"Rocky's Box" in Yarmouthport is very sweet and TeamNewHampshire carves wonderful stamps. We were sorry we didn't have more time to find their boxes. "Peace Day", and "A Very Gorey Letterbox" are highly recommended for their intricate carvings as are other boxes by Aschimedes Screw. (We saw the images from her "Alice in Orleans" series and marveled but did not have time to go for them, sadly). There are other boxes in the same area as the "Gorey" box so look for their clues too. "Crafter's Landing" (in store) is another good one especially if you need supplies or are a rubber stamper!<br/>
<br/>
We did get one of the baseball series (CCBL West Box #1) too.<br/>
<br/>
Have a lovely trip!<br/>

The gathering on the Cape is this weekend, so I can tell you what <br/>
some good boxes are in the area around the gathering.  I'm hoping to <br/>
pluck as many of the Yarmouth, East Dennis, and Barnstable boxes as <br/>
possible, but with a gathering in the middle of the day, I don't <br/>
know how many I'll get.  My printout sheet shows nearly 90 boxes in <br/>
the town of Yarmouth alone, including mysteries.  Yowzers!  Cape Cod <br/>
is becoming the next Connecticut!<br/>

League series was a collaboration between Cape Cod Letterboxer and<br/>
Mumma and Bunny Boy.  I carved the bonus box.  They are still out<br/>
there, but do require a lot of driving between boxes.  For less<br/>
driving and more boxing, come to Yarmouth.  It is where a bunch of<br/>
letterboxers live and have been planting.  We're pretty good about<br/>
updating our clues, so if they are listed as available they probably are.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your time on the Cape.<br/>

are in place. Bourne Braves is missing and probably wont be replaced <br/>
however. We are working on a new plan for this series. Now that the <br/>
Cape gathering is over the future for these baseball boxes are unsure. <br/>
We are working on a few ideas. For anyone planning to get this series, <br/>
please check the clues before you head out. Most of the clues have <br/>
changed a lot and if any are missing, its posted in the clues.<br/>
