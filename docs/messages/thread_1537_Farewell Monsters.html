but the time did fly and now The End is here.  It was such fun <br/>
dashing out to Mansfield at every chance during October when the <br/>
falling leaves welcomed us and the Harvest Moon warned us to get out <br/>
of the woods before dark!  How exciting to meet up with fellow <br/>
boxers on the trails for a quick exchange, a little "Monster Chat" <br/>
and then back to Mashing! Now as the Monsters leave the woods of <br/>
Mansfield and head towards home, all we have left are their memories <br/>
in out logbooks.  Good enough for me!! (Although a little sad to see <br/>
it all end).  THANK YOU, Chuck for a wondrous boxing month!<br/>
Till next time....     MayEve</div>
