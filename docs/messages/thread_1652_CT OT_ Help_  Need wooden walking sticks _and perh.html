students at school are doing a play for Christmas and each shepherd needs a stick or <br/>

NOT YOU BUTTERFLY!) for a week or so?  <br/>

Please e-mail me off list and I can come by and pick them up and drop them <br/>
back off again.  The performance is on the 14th.<br/>

well as they need sticks.  But Hark, don't they need the curved hook at <br/>
the top? If they are true shepherds, the need to aid lost sheep demands <br/>
a hook.  So be it :-)<br/>
Butterfly whose stick is crooked, but much too short,  plus it has been <br/>
lost and found too many times already.<br/>
