                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-32794428">Well, the account of our adventures:<br/>
<br/>
Rule #1: While letterboxing, make sure to seek out the correct <br/>
driving directions.<br/>
<br/>
Do NOT, and I repeat DO NOT USE MAPQUEST.COM to find any sort of <br/>
driving directions.  This could cause you to drive for two hours, <br/>
instead of driving for what could have been a half an hour...*grumble*<br/>
<br/>
Rule #2: Make sure your rain poncho is thicker than a plastic bag, or <br/>
else you will get hot &amp; sweaty, and tear it off, and become drenched <br/>
from the rainy weather in the forest.<br/>
<br/>
Rule #3: Make sure to know which side of the pavilion to start the <br/>
April Showers series on.  Or else risk walking for what seems like <br/>
forever, deeper and deeper into the woods and farther and farther <br/>
away from any sort of landmarks.<br/>
<br/>
Rule #4: When you have a personal traveler, be prepared for people to <br/>
flock near you to earn the stamp.  And make sure you do not have <br/>
doubts of your ink pad running out.<br/>
<br/>
Rule #5: Do not trust Butterfly when she says she's leaving and must <br/>
get your personal traveler right away.  Hahaha...<br/>
<br/>
Rule #6: When someone wins in the raffle three, or four times, make <br/>
sure to make them feel guilty enough to not accept anything else <br/>
after getting a handbook, a walking stick, etc. And make sure that <br/>
you find out that you can buy more tickets (unfortunately we did not <br/>
know this...)<br/>
<br/>
Rule #7: Despite all the minor misfortunes, take a deep breath and <br/>
keep letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to MommaFox, Bald Eagle, Teach and Preach, and The Maplines <br/>
for making yesterday's event great!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everybody who found out about my personal traveler - I'm so <br/>
glad everybody liked the first stamp I carved (hey I'm trying to be <br/>
humble here)...I think I should try and make a list of everybody who <br/>
got my P.T.<br/>
<br/>
I'm extremely sorry that for some of the people I met, it was a one <br/>
way exchange!! I was glad to get many exchanges - but to those who I <br/>
encountered when my stamp wasn't with me (Pine Cone, Pine Tree, Cat <br/>
Lover/Gardener/Teacher, Mystique...and anybody else I may have <br/>
missed!)...may we meet again!<br/>
<br/>
My P.T. will be available on the trail and at events with me...so <br/>
I'll probably post it again near a gathering date in the future...<br/>
<br/>
...also I heard talk of a gathering on the horizon of early June? Is <br/>
that the one people have been chatting about?<br/>

(spelling?) Park.  From what I hear, Letterboxer2002 has a great day (and night) <br/>
planned for us, including nighttime letterboxing!  Check out past LBNA and LBNE <br/>
