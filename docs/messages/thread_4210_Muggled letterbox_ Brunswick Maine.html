He is a former geocacher and had some idea of what it was.  Alas, the stamp is missing but the box is reusable and the tiny hitchhiker can be dried out and moved on.  I'll contact the owner and see if she would like to recarve or just retire the box.<br/>
<br/>
Chris (the Parks and Rec guy) says he knows how disappointing it can be not to find a geocache and just wanted to try and avoid that by notifying someone about the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
I'm impressed by his thoughtfulness.<br/>
