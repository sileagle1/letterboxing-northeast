I remember when we found it, not only was the logbook full but there  was a <br/>
huge stack of extra papers. So I know that hundreds of people have found  it. <br/>
That was back in Oct of 2005.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have the image but it really isn't a good copy. It wouldn't  be <br/>
very hard to recreate. I will contact you directly.<br/>
