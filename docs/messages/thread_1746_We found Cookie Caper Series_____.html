We had a wonderful day in Dutchess County, finding MANY places to go back to and visit, when we're not short on time!  The locations where the boxes were planted were absolutely beautiful!  I had a couple of favorites, but I don't want to spoil it for you!!!!<br/>

Thanks to Talking Turtle and the Alphabet Bandits for a great day!<br/>
