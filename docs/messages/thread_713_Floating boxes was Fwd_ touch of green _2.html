Maybe I should add water wings when I replace it...  The best note like this that I have ever received was a note from someone in OH who was trying to track a HH found at one of his boxes and realized it was a box that I had placed in San Diego and somehow had migrated East.<br/>

Found touch of green #2 while fishing. It was cought on a snag in the river. <br/>
Took on a little water but is fine. I think it was out of the playing area. <br/>
Want it back?<br/>
