and for some reason my brain just did not realize it was on May <br/>
Day!!!  By the time I was informed I had gotten many responses <br/>
expressing interest in an April Drive, both on the LBNE message <br/>
board and privately, and the overwhelming majority favored <br/>
03/30/05.  As I said in a private e-mail to Donutz, which was sent <br/>
to Momma Fox, I am hopeful that all are of the opinion that there <br/>
can never be too many boxing events, but if the organizers of the <br/>
MaY Day Gathering do not give their blessing for the April Drive <br/>
going forward on 03/30 I will respectfully alter my plans, re-group <br/>
and plan for 03/23 instead.<br/>
<br/>
As for progress with the April Drive, be it on 03/30 or 03/23, <br/>
Chrissy has offered her unparalleled experience in organizing <br/>
these "Drives" to assist our efforts.  Also, Music Woman has <br/>
graciously offered to help, which is phenominal especially because  <br/>
I think the Drive will center in Glastonbury (after starting in the <br/>
Capitol City for the unveiling of a new series by MayEve, RTRW and <br/>
Wild Rover), and Music Woman is second-to-none in Glastonbury <br/>
boxing.  I also received many offers to carve an event stamp, for <br/>
which I am grateful, but I believe RTRW will be carving the event <br/>
stamp.  MayEve is re-planting her "Good Grief" series in time for <br/>
the event, and I am planting the "House Of Mouse" series in <br/>
Glastonbury to debut for the Drive [with the new series in Hartford <br/>
and the "House Of Mouse" series there will be 12+ never-before seen <br/>
boxes debuting at the Drive].  Music Woman and Chrissy will be <br/>
helping to formulate a plan from there.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to have a chronological list of planned boxes along with <br/>
directions and my cell number available in advance so anybody <br/>
wishing to join en route can do so.  Thank you to all who have <br/>
replied supportively!!!  Once I have heard from Momma Fox I will <br/>
determine the date to be 03/30 or 03/23, and further details will <br/>
follow.  I apologize to Momma Fox for my mistake and for the <br/>
resulting date issue.  As Mark says, I just wanna "Get out there and <br/>
box!!!"  Thanks again to all.  ---Wild Rover<br/>

 As luck would have it, I knew there was a May Day Gathering planned,<br/>
and for some reason my brain just did not realize it was on May<br/>
Day!!! By the time I was informed I had gotten many responses<br/>
expressing interest in an April Drive, both on the LBNE message<br/>
board and privately, and the overwhelming majority favored<br/>
04/30/05. As I said in a private e-mail to Donutz, which was sent<br/>
to Momma Fox, I am hopeful that all are of the opinion that there<br/>
can never be too many boxing events, but if the organizers of the<br/>
MaY Day Gathering do not give their blessing for the April Drive<br/>
going forward on 04/30 I will respectfully alter my plans, re-group<br/>
and plan for 04/23 instead.<br/>
<br/>
As for progress with the April Drive, be it on 04/30 or 04/23,<br/>
Chrissy has offered her unparalleled experience in organizing<br/>
these "Drives" to assist our efforts. Also, Music Woman has<br/>
graciously offered to help, which is phenominal especially because<br/>
I think the Drive will center in Glastonbury (after starting in the<br/>
Capitol City for the unveiling of a new series by MayEve, RTRW and<br/>
Wild Rover), and Music Woman is second-to-none in Glastonbury<br/>
boxing. I also received many offers to carve an event stamp, for<br/>
which I am grateful, but I believe RTRW will be carving the event<br/>
stamp. MayEve is re-planting her "Good Grief" series in time for<br/>
