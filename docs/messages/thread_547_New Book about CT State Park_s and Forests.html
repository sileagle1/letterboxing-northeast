                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1047465682">Just thought you all might like to know about a new soft cover book <br/>
which is being launched this week by Friends of Connecticut State <br/>
Parks, Inc.  It is "A Shared Landscape" by Joseph Leary.  It is <br/>
$25.00 and is full of wonderful photography from all the places we <br/>
love in CT.  If you have trouble finding it at your local bookstores, <br/>
a friend of mine is on the committee, so I could help you purchase <br/>
one if interested. Just email us privately off the big list, and we'd <br/>
be glad to give a hand.  Thanks and Happy Boxing- Sunshine :0)</div>
