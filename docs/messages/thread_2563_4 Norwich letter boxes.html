Painters Pallet, and the Stone bridge. We have also pulled the Agent <br/>
Orange box in Coventry. The reason for this action is due to yet <br/>
another box of ours being destroyed, and more of them not rehidden well <br/>
so they could be spotted by anyone. One had been removed by a school <br/>
child and brought to school. Thankfully the school bus driver and the <br/>
school principle handled the situation and the box was returned. Bear <br/>
and I are very frustrated and disappointed in that there are people out <br/>
there that do not share the respect for others endeavours that most <br/>
letter boxers do. I know we make sure to re-hide every box we find as <br/>
well or better than the way we found it. If everyone did this there <br/>
might not be many boxes destroyed by vandals. Right now we are not sure <br/>
if we will re-plant these boxes. They will remain pulled for the winter <br/>
and if we re-plant them it will be in the spring of 2006. Thanks to all <br/>
who found our boxes and had the respect to put them back as they were.<br/>
