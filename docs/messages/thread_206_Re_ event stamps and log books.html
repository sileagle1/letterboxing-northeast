it around a gathering, sharing the images of stamps I've tracked <br/>
down. I have selectively shared it with people, showing all-time <br/>
favorite images for example.<br/>
How do others feel about logbooks and sharing them and the images <br/>
therein? Just curious. As an aside, the stories people share (in <br/>
person or on message board) are a fascinating part of letterboxing <br/>
for me.<br/>
 I still maintain that a lovely carved event stamp should not be <br/>
relegated to a drawer, never to be seen "live and in person" again. I <br/>
also believe letterboxing does not have hard and fast rules in these <br/>
grey areas.  Therefore, the final disposition of the event stamps <br/>
should be left to the discretion of the carver. <br/>

</span></blockquote>Personally, I love sharing my logbook with others<br/>
 and looking through theirs. I have noticed however that some people <br/>
don't always feel the same way I do which I found curious, so I <br/>
appreciate your perspective.<br/>
Sharing images, of course, always prompts wonderful story-telling <br/>
forays, one of my favorite pastimes! <br/>
