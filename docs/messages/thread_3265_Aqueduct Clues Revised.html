box with a friend, we discovered the box on the kiosk.  There has been<br/>
work done in the area where the box had been and a new bridge built. I<br/>
was very pleased to see that they had saved my box for me with<br/>
everything intact. The ink pad needs replacing and I didn't have one<br/>
with me so please bring your own. <br/>
<br/>
My friend is a new letterboxer and is Norwegian.  She says that the<br/>
word "kiosk" is a Norwegian word and is pronounced "djoosk", as close<br/>
as I can phoneticize it.  You learn something every day! <br/>
<br/>
BTW, I will be on vacation for the next 2 weeks, so if you have any<br/>
questions or comments, I won't be available after Monday until Nov. 1.<br/>
And I'll probably forget how to pronounce "kiosk" by then. ;-)<br/>
