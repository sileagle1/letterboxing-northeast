help translate, we were successful in finding Irish Tinker's neat <br/>
box.  What a cool stamp-Thanks!!<br/>
Also, has anyone else done the J. Wayne series lately and found the <br/>
Stagecoach box??? We've looked twice- once with lots of snow, and <br/>
again today and didn't have any luck.  All the other boxes are in <br/>
great shape. Today we found the only other one we couldn't find in <br/>
Feb. Just wondering.  Happy Boxing Everyone!! Sunshine, Swamp Yankee, <br/>

  I found the box in feb. and went back with my sister on march 30th and it's still there.  The pink ribbon is gone which is probably why you're having a problem, it's shortly after you cross the bridge. Prairie Girl<br/>
