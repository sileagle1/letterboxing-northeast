get one box today because it was in with mine. I went out to replace <br/>
some store bought stamps with my carved ones and found "Come Fly With <br/>
Me" in Plainville missing so I'm pulling it off the list. It wasn't <br/>
really a letterbox friendly place to begin with, I'm just glad they <br/>
only got the old stamp.<br/>

letterboxing gear!  I ended up buying some long johns and some glove inserts to <br/>
keep warm.  I'm hoping that the glove inserts will allow me to not freeze my <br/>
fingers when I have to take off my hefty gloves to stamp into a box!<br/>

Happy Winter boxing everyone!<br/>
