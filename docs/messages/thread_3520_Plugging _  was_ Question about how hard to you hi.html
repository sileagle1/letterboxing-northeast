<br/>
I have planted a few of the plugged in boxes that Mary has written about.  I <br/>
just hollow out a spot in the pine needles with enough room for the box, plug <br/>
it in and cap it with a marking stone.  No digging required.  I have had <br/>
several boxes in place this way for over 5 years.  They have fared more or less the <br/>
same as my other boxes. <br/>
<br/>
I went out to check on one the other day and found that a newt had taken up <br/>
residence under the box. <br/>
<br/>
Several well established, well known boxers in my area have left boxes this <br/>
way and it has worked quite well.  If you write the clues well and mark the <br/>
final spot, it is not an issue. I do not know of any letterboxes in this area <br/>
that were buried. It is my understanding that sometimes geocaches are buried. <br/>
<br/>
All said, I do prefer to to tuck my boxes under overhanging rocks, because I <br/>
feel that this gives the most protection.<br/>
<br/>
On on,<br/>
