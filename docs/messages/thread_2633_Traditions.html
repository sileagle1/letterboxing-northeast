a year. He is the one who helps more than he knows by `thinking out <br/>
of the box'. <br/>
Alas, lately, he has lost a little of the magic of the hobby. <br/>
I was pleased to have him, at dinner tonight, ask if we were going <br/>
to continue the `Tradition' of Letterboxing on Christmas Eve day.<br/>
A year ago to that day we found our first Hitch Hiker. What a <br/>
pleasant and unexpected surprise! After contacting the placer that <br/>
evening to inform them of the status of the HH we received a <br/>
poignant reply. <br/>
You never know how you can affect another's lives with a simple <br/>
reply!<br/>
<br/>
I am delighted that this HH has started a Christmas `Tradition' in <br/>
our family. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you, and Merry Christmas!.. to Russ et al! <br/>
