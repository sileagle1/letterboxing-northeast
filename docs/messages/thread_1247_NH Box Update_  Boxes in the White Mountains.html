                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1515393089">Hi all!  Just returned from a nice three-day weekend in the White <br/>
Mountains of New Hampshire!  Although our primary purpose over the <br/>
weekend was not letterboxing, we didn't manage to successfully hunt <br/>
nine boxes while we were there -- and picked up a hitchhiker along <br/>
the way!<br/>
<br/>
All of our finds are now listed on our website, but the write-ups <br/>
aren't yet complete.  They'll be there in a couple of days.<br/>
<br/>
The boxes we hunted were all in or near Franconia Notch and Crawford <br/>
Notch State Parks.<br/>
<br/>
The following boxes were all found to be intact and in good shape:<br/>
* Clark's Trading Post (Lincoln)<br/>
* Artist's Bluff (Franconia Notch)<br/>
* Little Dragonfly (Franconia Notch)<br/>
* A Snail Trail (Franconia Notch)<br/>
* Our First Vacation (Crawford Notch)<br/>
* Franky's (Crawford Notch)<br/>
* Pemi Trail (Franconia Notch)<br/>
<br/>
The following boxes were found, but had problems:<br/>
* Tigers at Twilight (Crawford Notch) -- this box was extremely <br/>
wet.  The logbook is completely ruined, as is the stamp pad.  The <br/>
stamp was fine.<br/>
* Arethusa Falls (Crawford Notch) -- everything about this box was <br/>
fine, except perhaps it's hiding place.  It could be seen from the <br/>
trail, and judging from the number of people who had written in the <br/>
logbook "found this box while answering nature's call", an alternate <br/>
location for this box might be wise.  We attempted to better obscure <br/>
it's hiding place after we stamped in.  If the placer reads this, <br/>
however, please don't retire the box -- hiking to these falls were <br/>
one of the highlights of our trip!<br/>
<br/>
Another box (The Basin Letterbox by Amanda from Seattle) exists in <br/>
Franconia Notch, but we were not aware of it as the clues were <br/>
listed on the LbNA website under the "Mystery Boxes" section even <br/>
though the box nor its clues have any mystery element.  We've <br/>
informed the placer.<br/>
<br/>
We're eager to go back to hunt the boxes in the eastern section of <br/>
the White Mountains next -- Conway, North Conway, Glen, etc.!<br/>
<br/>
Our trip enabled us to cross the F50 line ... and moving us closer <br/>
to our goal of 100 finds.  We'll certainly get there before the year <br/>
is over!<br/>
