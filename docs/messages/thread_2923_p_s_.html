<br/>
Sorry to hear things are so precarious down there.  I was relieved <br/>
to hear you were in decent shape so far.  It sounded like our fall <br/>
rains hit you harder than these.  This storm seems to have hit a <br/>
much larger area.  Right where I am (Lakes Region, central NH) some <br/>
roads have been washed out but our immediate area has been spared <br/>
any major destruction.  My basement began to fill but I got the sump <br/>
pump going.  The water is below the dock and the dam across the lake <br/>
is holding.  Until last fall it never occurred to me it could let <br/>
go.  (Naive I guess) I guess we'll have to check the status of our <br/>
Covered Bridge Letterboxes when the waters recede.  Hopefully they <br/>
were replaced carefully and the boxes are holding up.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my prayers are with you and others who are being affected by <br/>
this mess. <br/>

&gt;  well our county is back on flood alert. the webster dam, <br/>
northeast of us,<br/>
&gt; broke and drained the lake. forecast is changed, torrential rains <br/>
