<br/>
Surfer Joe and I will be heading back to New England for the weekend. I'll <br/>
be hanging out in the Hartford area on Thursday and the two of us will be <br/>
staying in Worcester Friday through Sunday. We're looking for some lovely <br/>
hikes (and boxes, of course) and are open to your suggestions. We're <br/>
willing to drive as much as an hour and a half from Worcester and will <br/>
probably explore the Shelburne Falls area on Saturday as well.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any recommendations!<br/>

McLean had some BEAUTIFUL snow white mountain laurel near Spring Pond that shouldn't be missed!!!!  Miss Risley in Vernon is also a nice hike!<br/>
