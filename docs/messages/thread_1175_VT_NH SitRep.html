the opportunity to do some letterboxing in Vermont and a few in New <br/>

<br/>
Vermont boxes that are alive and well:<br/>
Twilight series (3) - we were first finders<br/>
The Graveyard<br/>
Mad River Glen Ski Area<br/>
Prayer Rock<br/>
Shrine to the Stars<br/>
Quechee Gorge<br/>
Ottauquechee Bridge<br/>
Vermont Bug<br/>
<br/>
We were also able to successfully locate several boxes currently listed <br/>
only in the basement:<br/>
Cemetery Walk<br/>
Working on the Railroad<br/>
VT Covered Bridge<br/>
Long Trail - Mad River Lookout<br/>
Enigma Stone<br/>
<br/>
New Hampshire boxes alive and well:<br/>
Rose Mary's Shower<br/>
Thumbs Away<br/>
<br/>
We were not able to find the Ethan Allen Homestead box, Brownsville <br/>
Lighthouse or Brownsville Cemetery in VT.  I also planted 6 boxes along <br/>
the way; I am still working on the clues for several of them as they <br/>
involve photos - should be up by the end of the week.<br/>
<br/>
Vermont:<br/>
Little Egypt<br/>
Birthplace of Vermont<br/>
Top of Smugg's<br/>
Snowflake Bentley<br/>
another one I haven't named yet (will be a mystery box in Lamoille <br/>
county)<br/>
<br/>
New Hampshire:<br/>
A Walk in the Woods<br/>
<br/>
I'd appreciate all the help I can get in monitoring these boxes since I <br/>
live 3000 miles away from them.  I have a boxsitter for the one in NH <br/>
(another one of those Nancy Drew fans that lives in the area), and <br/>
probably I can get my aunt to monitor the others if I know there are <br/>
any issues/problems.<br/>
<br/>
I also had a chance to do a couple of days of boxing in the lands of <br/>
plenty: MA and CT but that would make for a very long email to describe <br/>
all my adventures there.  A huge thank you to Bookworm who showed me <br/>
around Mansfield and Coventry!<br/>

  We were able to locate, on August 25, 2004,<br/>
<br/>
Cemetery Walk -- box is very wet, but stamp is great<br/>
Working on the Railroad -- log is damp, but again, stamp is great<br/>
VT Covered Bridge -- all fine, another great stamp.<br/>
  -- thanks to The von der Insels for sending us the links to those <br/>
clues in the basement!<br/>
<br/>
  We also visited Twilight series (3) and highly recommend this <br/>
series as it brings you to three beautiful spots (the dh was very <br/>
happy with these -- great for photographers). I felt like I had been <br/>
treated to a special guided tour of Brownington - places I don't <br/>
think we'd have found during our vacation week otherwise.<br/>

&gt;   We were also able to successfully locate several boxes currently listed <br/>
&gt;   only in the basement:<br/>
&gt;   Cemetery Walk<br/>
&gt;   Working on the Railroad<br/>
&gt;   VT Covered Bridge<br/>
&gt;   Long Trail - Mad River Lookout<br/>
&gt;   Enigma Stone<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   New Hampshire boxes alive and well:<br/>
&gt;   Rose Mary's Shower<br/>
&gt;   Thumbs Away<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   We were not able to find the Ethan Allen Homestead box, Brownsville <br/>
&gt;   Lighthouse or Brownsville Cemetery in VT.  I also planted 6 boxes along <br/>
&gt;   the way; I am still working on the clues for several of them as they <br/>
&gt;   involve photos - should be up by the end of the week.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Vermont:<br/>
&gt;   Little Egypt<br/>
&gt;   Birthplace of Vermont<br/>
&gt;   Top of Smugg's<br/>
&gt;   Snowflake Bentley<br/>
&gt;   another one I haven't named yet (will be a mystery box in Lamoille <br/>
&gt;   county)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   New Hampshire:<br/>
&gt;   A Walk in the Woods<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I'd appreciate all the help I can get in monitoring these boxes since I <br/>
&gt;   live 3000 miles away from them.  I have a boxsitter for the one in NH <br/>
&gt;   (another one of those Nancy Drew fans that lives in the area), and <br/>
&gt;   probably I can get my aunt to monitor the others if I know there are <br/>
&gt;   any issues/problems.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I also had a chance to do a couple of days of boxing in the lands of <br/>
&gt;   plenty: MA and CT but that would make for a very long email to describe <br/>
&gt;   all my adventures there.  A huge thank you to Bookworm who showed me <br/>
&gt;   around Mansfield and Coventry!<br/>
