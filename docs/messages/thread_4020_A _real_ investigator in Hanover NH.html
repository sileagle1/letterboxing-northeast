I thought this might be refering to a geocache (see what you think) but I wanted to pass it on in case anyone knows of a WOM clue to a box at this location. If you want to talk with the Detective please let me know and I'll forward his email and phone number. Thanks for the help, Jay in CT<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;We had a fire on what is known as Gilman Island in Hanover, NH.  The island is on the Connecticut River between NH and VT about Â¼ mile south of the bridge that runs between Hanover, NH and Norwich, VT.  A rental cabin was burned to the ground.  We are not sure what the cause was so we are trying to find anyone that may have recently been on the island.  While searching the island I found a clear plastic Tupperware container that had a pen, pad of paper, dollar bill, gum and other assorted items inside.  It was hidden under a root at the trunk of a tree.  Someone suggested that it may be a letterboxing or other similar type cache.<br/>
<br/>
What I am hoping to learn is whether the container I found is a letterboxing cache or not.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time.&gt;&gt;&gt;</div>
