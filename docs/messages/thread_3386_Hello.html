look at the newboxers patch that just came out.  I moved to NH at the<br/>
end of August and began looking for letterboxes just about a month ago<br/>
(the Dog Walk box in Somersworth, NH was my first).  I'm excited to LB<br/>
in the NE as well as exploring the area!  <br/>

<br/>
A big thank you for all the thought , effort and work you put out to make sure that we would all have a great time at the Back To Our Roots gather  in VT..  <br/>
I know that I enjoyed every minute of it , every hill I climbed, every puddle I tried to skirt ~every trail I walked ~ every letterbox I got to hunt and find , all the people, new to me as well as the many " old" friends , and even the few rain drops that splashed down now and then . <br/>
<br/>
Can't think of anything that could wipe the smile off my face .<br/>
<br/>
Thanks greatly .<br/>
a happy butterfly <br/>
