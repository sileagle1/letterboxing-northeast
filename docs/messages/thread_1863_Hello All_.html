                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1666153654">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to write a quick post saying hello to all of you.  I <br/>
have been away from letterboxing for a while and was very <br/>
disappointed to see all the hate being thrown around on the main <br/>
talklist.  I am glad there is a place to see whats going on in the <br/>
letterboxing world without the slander.<br/>
<br/>
My wife and I just got back from a weeks vacation in England, <br/>
Ireland, and Wales.  It was a great time.  At one point we were so <br/>
close to Dartmoor.  I almost convinced my companions to travel the <br/>
extra distance so I could say a quick hello to some of my favorite <br/>
tors.  Alas we decided to visit Bath and Stonehenge instead ;(<br/>
<br/>
I hope all is well in "letterboxing-land".  Perhaps with the big <br/>
melt to come, I will take Mark's advise and "get out and box".  <br/>
Until then, I hope you all stay safe and have a great time <br/>
letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes-<br/>

<br/>
Perhaps we can get together soon to swap Dartmoor stories :-)  Have you seen some of my pics?  THey're on the LBNA Photo site on Yahoo.<br/>

Hope to hear from you soon!<br/>

Needed time off to get married and now I guess the "honeymoon's <br/>
over" if you're talking about getting back to letterboxing!!!!!  ;-)<br/>
Hope your wife enjoys it too? <br/>
See you on the trails somewhere, Alan, or perhaps at a gathering!<br/>

P.S. - Bookworm, I feel the same way you do!<br/>

Glad to see you still exist amongst us!  Hope you had a great time in<br/>
Europe, and maybe some boxing may begin to entice you to get out there<br/>
again?<br/>
