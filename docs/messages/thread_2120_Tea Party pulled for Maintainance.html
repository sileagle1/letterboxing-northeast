yesterday.  All 3 tea party boxes were still there, and the first 2 <br/>
were in pretty good shape.  Alas, the top had cracked on the 3rd box, <br/>
and the box was filled up with rain water.  We were able to salvage <br/>
the stamp, but lost everything else.  All 3 boxes are in for <br/>
maintainance and repair, and we will post when we put them back out.  <br/>
Thanks to all who visited these- we have been enjoying reading the <br/>
logbooks.  These were some of our first boxes, so they are near and <br/>
dear to our hearts.<br/>
