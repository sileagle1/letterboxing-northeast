couple weeks @ Hattie's restuarant in Biddeford, ME....<br/>
<br/>
Although not technically one of the listed organizers, I was asked <br/>
to see if we could promote this a bit more on the larger sites.......<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is currently listed on AQ, please RSVP and if you have a stamp <br/>
idea.. please contact Hattie (Splish Splash) or Nautilus....directly <br/>
to their emails :0)<br/>

<br/>
The general theme is the summer solstice ! and will feature carvings <br/>
by several new letterboxers and some "vets"... LOL<br/>
<br/>
It should be an excellent chance to meet some new boxers and get to <br/>
know some of the names you might have seen along the trails......!!<br/>
<br/>
I hope all of you will consider attending.....<br/>
Thanks <br/>

<br/>
1.  I posted an invite to everyone to attend a gathering in which I <br/>
specifically indicated that I was not an organizer and was helping <br/>
one of the organizers by posting their invite on this board.....<br/>
<br/>
2. I publically announced a yahoo group which does ask that you have <br/>
exchanged with one of the original members....Namely myself and 3 <br/>
others... In the email reply I sent you I also indicated this .... <br/>
(Which also had an invite to join that particular group as soon as <br/>
the above had occured... I can forward you back that email if you <br/>
wish)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3. It is apparent that you chose to ignite something here which is a <br/>
shame... You could have emailed me personally with your concerns....<br/>
<br/>
I hope that in the future that if you or anyone else has concerns or <br/>
comments about myself and my committment to this wonderful hobby you <br/>
contact me DIRECTLY....<br/>
I am NOT Hard to find.......and am very directly able to respond in <br/>
a more straight forth and respectable manner that a public flame <br/>
throwing.....<br/>
<br/>
Finally<br/>
<br/>
I apologize to the group moderators and fellow letterboxers that <br/>
this individual chose this forum to post this ....<br/>
<br/>
Humbly &amp; respectfully submitted<br/>
