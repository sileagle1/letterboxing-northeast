Does anyone who went to the gathering at Salmon River remember picking <br/>
up two canvas chairs, the type that fold up and are stored in a nylon <br/>
bag?  They were bright yellow and lyme green.  I totally forgot to get <br/>
them when chthiker and I left that day.  If anyone picked them up <br/>
would you contact me off list.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
