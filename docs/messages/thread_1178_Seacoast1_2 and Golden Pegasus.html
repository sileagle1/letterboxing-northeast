we wanted to find  the Golden Pegasus, we had to pass the location of<br/>
Seacoast1 - found no box. Think we found the spot for Seacoast2 which<br/>
was reported as missing but went on from there to look for the Golden<br/>
Pegasus.  Found the rotted stump with a wonderful hiding place within<br/>
it - even a nice covering of wood on the top, but no box.  A<br/>
disappointing last search of the day.  Still was a nice hike once we<br/>
found the trails which are not named on the trail map. <br/>
