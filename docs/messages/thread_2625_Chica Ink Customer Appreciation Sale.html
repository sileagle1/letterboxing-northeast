December 3,4, and 5.  Currently, for any purchase you make in Wickford, <br/>
you get a raffle ticket that entitles you to a drawing for all kinds of <br/>
cool stuff (worth about $1000).  Plus, how can you resist Wickford at <br/>
Christmas!<br/>

promote letterboxing.  *Actively*.  You might want to check for <br/>
letterboxes in the Wickford area before you head down, if you know what <br/>
I mean.<br/>

I thought I saw something on Chronicle about Wickford's annual Christmas lighting.The <br/>
story also said that Wickford had some of the best shopping around. I really don't like the <br/>
Mall. Sorry I missed it! Wickford is such a scenic town.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>
P.S. Wickford does seem to be letterbox rich!!!<br/>
