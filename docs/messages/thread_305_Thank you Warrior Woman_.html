meeting new people, and once again seeing people I'd met previously.<br/>
It was good fun. <br/>
<br/>
Also, the dinner afterwards was great. I think I got more Pokemon tips<br/>
from KStar's son than letterboxing gossip, but I need all the help on<br/>
Pokemon that I can get!! : )<br/>
<br/>
It was just a great day...thakn you!<br/>
