                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-118490533">Just came back from doing the Pooh Bear series.  What great stamps and <br/>
just plain fun to look at.  Found the Montville Indian Series, also fun <br/>
stamps and all the boxes were easy to find and in good condition.  Did <br/>
The Grizzly Bear while we were there and it's in good condition also. <br/>
All these boxes were well hidden. Just couldn't stop so we went to <br/>
LiveStrong.  This box holds special meaning for me as my Dad passed <br/>
away last October from cancer and I admire Lance Armstrong for all his <br/>
efforts to raise money.  Grumpy and I like to bike so we feel a special <br/>
connection to him. Saw Donutz on the trail and forgot to have her do an <br/>
exchange with my niece-what was I thinking???  All and all it was a <br/>
great day to be out, my 14 year old niece is hooked and as far as I <br/>
concerned it doesn't get much better than that.<br/>
Thanks Sunshine for the use of your facilities!  Good thing you live so <br/>
close.<br/>
