One of the first geocaches we found (by accident - right near a letterbox) was tastelessly plied with sticks of fruit-striped, sugary gum. It was wedged under a boulder in the dirt. Mmmmmm... hot summer weather, humid ocean air, and contact with the ground... it was screaming "I'd make the perfect candy dish!"  What the heck were the finders thinkin' ? Everything in the bottom of the cache was sticky. Guess they don't know much about the outdoors.  Surprisingly, no animals seemed to have bothered with this one, just bugs.  <br/>

</span></blockquote>Mumma &amp; BB - I think this is unfortunate and also at the same time -<br/>
very interesting. I have many thoughts on the HFCS allergies and<br/>
completely agree with you that it is not appropriate to put food in a<br/>
letterbox at all.<br/>
<br/>
Your post was the first time I have heard of a HFCS allergy. I can't<br/>
help but think that our genetically modified corn in the food system<br/>
has something to do with it.<br/>
