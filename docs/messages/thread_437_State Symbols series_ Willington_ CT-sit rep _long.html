could find boxes 3-5. L.b. #3 was soaked inside..logbook drenched.  I <br/>
placed wet logbook in a fresh baggie and set up a new logbook.  Dried <br/>
everything out and took away the soggy inkpad. L.b. #4 had a cracked <br/>
lid.  Damp inside but log o.k.I placed the whole box in a large <br/>
ziplock (the one it was in had been chewed on). With great relief, <br/>
box #5 was just fine.<br/>
  Does anyone know how to contact the placers, Willington Gang? I <br/>
sent e-mail via LBNA website clue sheet but got no reply.    <br/>
  In my opinion, these boxes need and deserve adoption if their <br/>
owners are not able to do the upkeep.   The clues are so well done, <br/>
the stamps are works of art, and the park is very pleasant to hike <br/>
in. (Stamps are starting to deteriorate, which I can't help with but <br/>
perhaps others could copy/remake them). <br/>
  The hike was awesome, by the way!<br/>
