                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-96972432">Diane and I went out on Valentine's Day at F98.  We went through Frenchtown Park, RI, and found the Common Thread LB (the second box) first, but not the first box.  F99!  We went up to Crossways Crossed Pathways with an old printout of the directions for two letterboxes.  We found one, but not the second - good enough!  F100.  Hurrah!  At home, we looked at the website to see that there's only one box there, nowadays, anyway.  Next time, I'll think ahead to check updates!  I understand there's a box of some sorts for F100s?<br/>
<br/>
    Today, Sunday, we took a climb up Pettaquamscett Rock (Pett Rock, of course) to view the Viking Ships at Sunrise - lovely stamp and view!  Still using old directions, we went to the Fishing Hole in Richmond, RI.  It's still there, all right, but some critter et the box.  The baggies were gnawed on, too.  We replaced the baggies and the gunky ink, but we didn't have a box on us.  If anyone knows rijester (the e-address doesn't work anymore), please let her/him know!  The spot is somewhat sheltered, but it'll need either retiring or boxifying.   The logbooks often speak of poison ivy, but this month sure doesn't have that problem!<br/>
<br/>
    Grass Pond Preserve, afterwards, was a very nice hike.  I can see how it could get a lot of underbrush in warm times.  It's a bit chilly, and the ice is still something to watch out for, but we're not itching from PI.  We were blessed with a hitchhiker for our efforts, too.<br/>

Congratulations on F100.  Hearing you mention some of my favorite <br/>
boxes brings back fond memories.<br/>
<br/>
Scoutdogs has a postal F100 box.  She is not in the north east so you <br/>
should post on either the "big" list or the postal letterboxing group <br/>
site to get on her mailing list.<br/>
<br/>
As you might expect, there is a big list of people waiting for this <br/>
box so the box is slow getting around.  But some day when you least <br/>
expect it you will find it in your mailbox.<br/>
<br/>
again, congratulations,<br/>
