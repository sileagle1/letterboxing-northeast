 I recently had a hornet sting this summer. It took me nearly a month for my leg to <br/>
look normal again. I can't imagine what 27 bites might do to a person. I would have <br/>
gone into shock and definitely would have needed a hospital visit.<br/>
<br/>
Please rest up and take care of yourself. That is a very traumatic thing.<br/>
Hope you're feeling better soon.<br/>

<br/>
Please take care of yourself, WW.  I will call. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, WW sliced her foot open on an oyster or razor clam shell or something when we were boxing this year.  She didn't apply for the purple heart then.  I wonder if she will want it now?<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe someone should design a special Calamity box just for her... ;-)<br/>
