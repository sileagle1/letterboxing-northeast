It takes a lot of planning, time and effort to organize a gathering.  Thanks to Wild Rover, MaeEve, and RTRW for making a dreary day so much fun!  <br/>

A really big THANK YOU to RTRW for warmly wecoming us into her home mid-day to snack, refresh, regroup, exchange and mingle; and to Mark and Sue Pepe who "covered" the Drive so nicely on their website and whose encouragement made the day; and to Music Woman for her wise input and fine organizational skills; and to Donutz and Corinna and those who tirelessly inked up at the stops; and to Pine Tree for letting us use her Walkie Talkies (even though I didn't know how to use them!); and to Flutterby for helping me re-hide boxes!!  AND to my favorite brother Wild Rover for being the heart and soul of the Drive and Krusty Krab for being the inspiration.<br/>

Letterboxing in itself is a wonderful thing, but it's the people you meet along the way that leave you with much more than a stamp in your logbook!  Thank You ALL<br/>

committment to getting the info out to everybody the event could not <br/>
possibly have been such a success.  RTRW, I can't thank you (and <br/>
Scott) enough for your wonderful hospitality, and for the awe-<br/>
inspiring Event Stamp and the remarkable Horace Wells &amp; Isreal <br/>
Putnam stamps. Music Woman &amp; Donutz, as I knew would be the case <br/>
your help with organizing everything and keeping the stamping <br/>
efficient was invaluable.  MayEve, it was so much fun doing this <br/>
whole event with you that I just can't wait to do it again, and the <br/>
lessons &amp; skills you taught me will make me a better boxer.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to thank EVERYBODY who attended and made the event so <br/>
special.  Krusty Krab thought she was going boxing with Daddy &amp; <br/>
Auntie to do the House Of Mouse Series, and lo and behold 30+ people <br/>
turned out to box with her for her birthday !!!  From the outset I <br/>
knew it would be a success, as Music Woman led us into the Roaring <br/>
Brook Nature Preserve, and Paul from the Maplines proceeded to build <br/>
a walkway across the brook where the bridge had washed out.  Friends <br/>
helping friends, teamwork, having fun, enjoying each other's <br/>
company... I just want to thank you all.  The event was very, very <br/>
special to me, and you all made it so.  ---Wild Rover<br/>
