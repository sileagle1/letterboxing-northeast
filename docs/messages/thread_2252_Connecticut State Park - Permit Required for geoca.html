                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-88850785">I was looking around in the geocaching forums, and I found this <br/>
thread.  It looks like the CT DEP is going to require permits for <br/>
geocaching.  Their concerns do not presently extend to letterboxing.  <br/>
We should keep an eye on this and see how it develops.<br/>
<br/>
There may have been an unfortunate placement of a geocache in a <br/>
historical location that started the concern.  From the discussion it <br/>
looks like when a park manager is brought into the activity and has <br/>
geocaching explained to him or her, they are enthused with the <br/>
activity.<br/>
