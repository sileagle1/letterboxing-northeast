Southern Maine is currently under a "winter storm watch" so that includes the York <br/>
County area. They are due for 3-5 inches Tuesday night through Wednesday and <br/>
another storm that will carry over from Thursday night to Friday during the day.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure how this set of storms will impact your driving and travel plans for the <br/>
letterboxing at Laudholm event, but I do hope you all will use caution. Winter is FAR <br/>
from over in Maine.<br/>
