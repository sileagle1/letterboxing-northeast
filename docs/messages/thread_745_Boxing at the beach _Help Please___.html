                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-111416094">Hi, last September I did some boxes on the Cape. I did four boxes <br/>
along the canal - Cape Cod Canal Railroad Bridge, Belmont Rock, The <br/>
Herring Run and Bourne Bridge. I also did The Gateway to the Cape Cod <br/>
Canal and The Anchorage in Sandwich and The Glassworks in Sagamore. <br/>
All of these boxes were relatively close together. Secrets of the <br/>
Knob and Nobsque Light in Woods Hole are two others that are close.  <br/>
I could only find the first box of Andrew's 10th Birthday in Mashpee. <br/>
I hope this gives you some help and some ideas. I can't give you any <br/>
ideas of where to stay since we always stay in Falmouth Heights. Good <br/>
luck and happy hunting! Queen B<br/>

you'll have to probably pay for parking at the beaches. <br/>
That being said, I'm partial to the Dennis/Harwich area, which is <br/>
about 1 1/2 hours from Boston and is right in the middle of the lower <br/>
cape. <br/>
Good boxes to get:<br/>
Any box by The HeadLess Hunter (Scargo Tower,Black Crow, Ghost Train, <br/>
Forgotten Road)<br/>
Reunion<br/>
Chatham Rooster 2<br/>
Flax Pond series<br/>
