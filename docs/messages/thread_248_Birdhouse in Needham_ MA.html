<br/>
Though this box is very well-visited, Binx and I would like to add <br/>
our recommendation to that of others that all area boxers who <br/>
haven't been, go! For reasons that will become apparent once you've <br/>
been there, we also plan to re-do the short walk in warmer weather <br/>
to experience this special location with a different ambiance. Kudos <br/>
to JIM the placer!<br/>
<br/>
Also recommended, for a beautiful winter spectacle is the area of <br/>
the first box in the Noanet series of Dover, MA. We didn't find the <br/>
box (likely due to frozen ground) but the short walk was well worth <br/>
it, though icy!<br/>
<br/>
We look forward to seeing everyone at the gathering in two weeks!<br/>
