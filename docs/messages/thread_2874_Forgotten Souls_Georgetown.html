Georgetown, MA and found the Forgotten Souls letterbox, no problem. This is the box that <br/>
had been reported as missing at one time but that's not the case. It was right where the <br/>
clues described.<br/>
<br/>
So for those that think their boxes may have gone missing, here's proof that they may <br/>
wander and then find their way home.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>
P.S. Great box by the way!</div>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1310478775">Thanks for the compliment on the letterbox!  I am delighted to echo <br/>
the comment for placers NOT to give up on a missing box.  This box <br/>
was "gone missing" for several months.  Even the friend who watches <br/>
over the box for me could not find it ~ and he knew where it was <br/>
supposed to be!  Someone ~ and I apologize for not remembering exactly <br/>
who first contacted me ~ found it, followed by at least one or two <br/>
other people.  I got detailed descriptions from them of where they had <br/>
found it.  My friend went back one more time and, with that added <br/>
information, found the box.  It had been moved a fair distance away ~ <br/>
20 paces from a maple tree but the wrong maple tree!  This box is now <br/>
back where it started and my friend says that, while well hidden, it <br/>
will be obvious to a letterboxer.<br/>
<br/>
My thanks to everyone who wrote to let me know it was still there and <br/>
shared details.  This is one of my favorite boxes and has sentimental <br/>
value to me.  I am SO pleased it is not gone.<br/>
