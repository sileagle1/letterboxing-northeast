We found Susie Sells Seashells LB but think the Portsmouth Harbor Light and Hear the Sea LB's are both missing.  Has anyone else done these recently?  We were fairly certain we found the right spot, even some rocks that most likely concealed, but could find no signs of the letterboxes.  Let me know if anyone else has info on them.  <br/>
