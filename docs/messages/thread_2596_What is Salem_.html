and<br/>
had my wife edit the clues so you be understanding gooder . . .and I did not<br/>
read through them until just now. I had to re-edit the clues just a bit so<br/>
they are more accurate.<br/>
<br/>
So in other words, if you downloaded the clues you might want to do that<br/>
again to get the fresher clues. Not that you couldn't have found the boxes<br/>
with the older clues, it's just I don't want to get beat up for misleading<br/>
clues. <br/>

PS Hope everyone had an excellent Thanksgiving! And if your a veghead like<br/>
me,<br/>
enjoy the Tofurkey.. <br/>
