What do you put in your tick kit?  Do you use any kind of repellent?<br/>

Tick protection is a must. Just because the mosquitoes are not out <br/>
doesn't mean you should pass up the DEET. I've always used the simple <br/>
bottle of OFF. On Sat. I sprayed up but my boyfriend did not. Two <br/>
hours later I found 8 ticks on him; I was thankfully tick free. Deer <br/>
were plentiful of course: we spotted a herd of 5. We were in the <br/>
Charles River valley in Dover, MA (Peters Reservation). I dunno if <br/>
there is a complete list of boxes in this town and its neighbors.<br/>

I do feel somewhat goofy with my pants legs tucked in my socks, but it's not much different from my other way of going in the wood:- with BDU pants tucked smartly into boots - so what the heck?<br/>
