got to stamp in with his new sig stamp! We went to Devil's Hopyard <br/>
and found Waterfalls 2, Curious George and the Giant's Chair and <br/>
Hopbox. We attempted Happy Birthday, but by the time we realized how <br/>
close we were at the end of Curious George, we had passed it and <br/>
were too tired to go back up the hill! All boxes were in good shape, <br/>
although Curious George needs a new log book! Sorry we didn't have <br/>
supplies with us today! Lots of people out today enjoying hte nice <br/>
weather, but we didn't see any other boxers.<br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year to all!<br/>
