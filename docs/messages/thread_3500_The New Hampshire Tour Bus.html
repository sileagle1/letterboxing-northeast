                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1559927512">So now that i had you all waiting, I think it is about time I let you <br/>
in on this box I have had in the works for sometime now. The New <br/>
Hampshire Tour Bus.<br/>
<br/>
This is special box that moves around from location to location.<br/>
I have taken this idea from a box in texas by the same name.<br/>
I have decided to tweak it a little bit though.<br/>
<br/>
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:<br/>
====================<br/>
--This box is to picked up by the first person that finds it.<br/>
<br/>
--What you should do as a possible finder, is carve a stamp of a <br/>
person or your choice to become a passenger of the tour bus. <br/>
<br/>
--With a stamp carved, you would then go out and get this box, bring <br/>
it home, add your stamp to the Tour Bus box, and plan on replanting <br/>
it somewhere else as soon as possible. If you can not replant this <br/>
box somewhere new as soon as possible, then DON'T go looking for it. <br/>
<br/>
--After picking up this box, you MUST post a message on the New <br/>
Hampshire messageboard on AQ, that you have picked up the box, then <br/>
repost when you have planted. <br/>
<br/>
--After the box has been notified as picked up, I will then put the <br/>
box up for adoption for the finder to adopt and post the new clues <br/>
for the Tour Bus location. Everytime changing the stamp total to 1 <br/>
number higher and leaving the name of the new passenger as well. This <br/>
process continues after everytime the box is reported as being taken <br/>
by a next first finder.<br/>
<br/>
--The number of passengers can not exceed 20. So this means, try to <br/>
keep the stamp size reasonable. The Tour Bus is in a decent size lock <br/>
n' lock box, so we should be able to meet 20 passengers. If the box <br/>
has run out of room and will not hold 20 passengers, please post so, <br/>
the box will needed to be planted 1 more time by the last finder and <br/>
put the box up for adoption for me to adopt for the last time. The <br/>
Tour Bus will sit in this new location for others to find and not <br/>
pick up for 1 month before being retired and picking it up from that <br/>
location by myself. From there, the box will become something else <br/>
not yet determined.<br/>
<br/>
--Ever stamp in the box is considered a find. The more stamps you <br/>
find in the box, the more stamps you can claim as being found. Please <br/>
do not let this discourage you from finding the box before anyone <br/>
else. You could always look for it later, when the bus is almost full <br/>
or resting at its final location.<br/>
<br/>
--Also, if the logbook is full, please replace it with a new one, <br/>
preferably one just like the one in the box, but who am I to be picky.<br/>
<br/>
--The difference between this Tour Bus and the one in Texas is, I am <br/>
allowing others from out of state to find this box. The only catch <br/>
is, I DO NOT want this box to EVER leave the state. Any out of <br/>
staters should look for this box with a new passenger in hand if you <br/>
choose to leave one, and replant at another loction in New Hampshire <br/>
before leaving the state. There is no obligation to take the box.<br/>
<br/>
--This post will be listed on the box clues to look at when ever you <br/>
may need to.<br/>
<br/>
--From what I can see, the only catch to this box is gas prices. You <br/>
must be aware that you might not find this box if you choose to go <br/>
looking for it. If someone goes looking for this box before you, it <br/>
may not be there when you get there. So if you decide to go looking <br/>
for this box, be prepared for the idea of coming home empty handed.<br/>
<br/>
SOMETHING ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW:<br/>
============================<br/>
The bus is ready to go, so get out there and come aboard.<br/>
Oh, and there is no bus driver, so if someone would like to carve the <br/>
bus driver, that would be awesome. I would have done it, but I <br/>
promised a friend that I would carve a stamps of her and make her a <br/>
passenger. I didn't want to fill up the box with my stamps, so if <br/>
someone wanted to do this, than again, that would be great.<br/>
<br/>
If there are any questions, feel free to post them here and I can <br/>
hopefully answer them for you.<br/>
