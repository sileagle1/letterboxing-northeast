tag-along. While stamping into tag-along, a young couple passed by.  I <br/>
tarried a bit to let them get ahead and they tarried a bit also. When <br/>
they finally went on, I hiked up the hill and realized they were <br/>
hanging at the spot where you ned to go down to the knoll. so...if I <br/>
kept you from getting this box, my apologies!! It would have been nice <br/>
to meet and exchange. <br/>
  Re. boxes: tag-along box is broken. I double bagged the dry inside <br/>
contents and put the whole box in a ziplock.<br/>
 Middlesex county box was wet inside. Previous stamper (a few days <br/>
before me) also found it wet. Nothing was damaged.  i doublebagged and <br/>
put whole box in a ziplock. Thanks, Sunshine, Swamp Yankee, Toadog and <br/>
Butterfly! <br/>
