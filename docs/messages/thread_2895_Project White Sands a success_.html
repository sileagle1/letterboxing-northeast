the park management heard all about letterboxing during the cleanup.<br/>

The geocaching community also holds cleanups regularly.  They are <br/>
called Cache In Trash Out, and the understanding with the management <br/>
is that they will welcome geocaches placed in their park.  It is <br/>
great for public relations and building a welcoming relationship. <br/>
<br/>
Should we hold "Letterbox In Litter Out" events at popular places?  <br/>
I would help out with that.  (Let's make up a good name.)<br/>

<br/>
  I am already thinking of holding another clean-up, which i hope to be bigger and better than my first.<br/>
