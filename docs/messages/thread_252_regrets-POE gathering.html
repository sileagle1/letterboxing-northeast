first proposed and now, my life has gotten unbelievably busy.  Much to my<br/>
regret, I won't be able to come to the gathering on the 28th. I'm buying a<br/>
condo (closing on March 8), I've got a freelance job coming up (in<br/>
addition to my full-time job), and I've got an art exhibition to prepare<br/>
for (in April).  Not to mention, I've got to pack and move.<br/>
<br/>
What does this all add up to?  No time for letterboxing!!!<br/>
<br/>
I hope you all have a great time.  Sometime this spring, after all the<br/>
dust settles, I will definitely get to Westborough and go boxing.<br/>
