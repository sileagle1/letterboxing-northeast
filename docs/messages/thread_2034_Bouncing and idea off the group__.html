boxes out for a period of time and people get the clues for  a donation to some <br/>
cause.  I think that if the money is to benefit the  local historic society <br/>
people will probably not mind giving to the cause.   After all, there are plenty <br/>
of boxes out there that people and families can  visit without having to pay a <br/>
fee of any kind, so those who are not interested  don't have to participate.<br/>

before you get the clues.<br/>
