When I give a  gift, if it is truly a gift, I give it without strings attached,  without expectations.  I enjoy a "Thank you" or some comments of  appreciation, but a true gift is given with no strings attached.   Thank you for that perspective!<br/>

Ah, just let the negativity roll right off your back like a hard rain on a slicker. It's just in some people's nature to be negative about anything and everything, and it's usually those people that think their clues, boxes, logbooks are better than everybody else's.  Who cares!  This isn't a contest and nobody is right or wrong.  Ignore the whiner and keep your boxes just as they are.  So there!  MayEve<br/>

Not worth pulling all of your boxes because most of the stuff was OK and you chose good locations. Just might want to modify some clues to avoid confusion for others :)<br/>

negative comments spoil your enjoyment of the hobby. However, consider <br/>
that the boxer who sent you the note may have thought of they were <br/>
helping or providing constructive criticism. I have received many notes <br/>
about clues over the years (and sent a few). If someone sent me a note <br/>
about a misspelling or word added/left out I would shrug and thank them <br/>
and probably make the change. Mistakes happen and lots of people make <br/>
simple typos. I also appreciate when people let me know about <br/>
problems/suggestions with clues. I reserve the right to do what I want <br/>
and write my clues how I want and ignore any suggested changes, however, <br/>
if 3 people write and express confusion about an aspect of my clues <br/>
maybe I'll change it to be clearer (or maybe not if it was intentionally <br/>
left vague). My point is that sometimes the original intent and the tone <br/>
is not always clear in an e-mail. I would first assume that they think <br/>
they are being helpful rather than criticizing the lovely letterbox <br/>
gifts that you have left for them. Happy continued boxing and planting!<br/>

&gt; Subject: [LbNE] Thinking of pulling all my boxes in NH<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have a letterboxer in NH that complains about all the clues --but<br/>
&gt; seems to find them allright. Like i spelled a word wrong... added<br/>
&gt; another word<br/>
&gt; i don't know- LB has had a reason for every box why clues are <br/>
wrong.<br/>
&gt; Have had these boxes out for over a year and this is the first time<br/>
&gt; someone has complained about every box.. Is it worth it?<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2100758017">I get hoards of email from people who complain about my clues and I either ignore them <br/>
or I write back a taughtly kind letter basically saying that finding a box is not a guarantee. <br/>
Of course I am thinking lots of OTHER things like: get a life, maybe the problem is YOU not <br/>
my clues, get an editing job etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't pull boxes over a few complaints. Just ignore this person! I also don't give hints <br/>
to my boxes, in general. I just don't respond to emails that ask for hints. I feel like finding <br/>
a box is a challenge and is not an instant satidfaction hobby. I know some people see <br/>
boxing that way and want to pump up their F-count, but I don't and I don't play that way. <br/>
Decide how you want to play, what boxing means to you and then be involved that way. <br/>
DOn't worry about what other people think. They have thousands of boxes to choose from <br/>
if theycan't seem to figure out your clues. These person is choosing to be bothered by his <br/>
or her inability to figure out you clues. Oh well! I think it is very rude to critique another <br/>
person's clues or give cluewriting tips! Don't pull your boxes! Leave them there for the <br/>
clever people to find, I say!<br/>
