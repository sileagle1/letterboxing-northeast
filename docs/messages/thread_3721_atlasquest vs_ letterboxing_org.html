However, AQ has additional features such as postals so many people list there due to that fact.  Many of the original letterboxers stay loyal to letterboxing.org.  I usually check both sites when logging finds.<br/>

I find this to be true in my area too (northwest of Boston).  However, since<br/>

bunch in a specific area.  I find the search/track functions on AQ much<br/>
easier to use.  I do not log finds on letterboxing.org, unless the clue is<br/>
only available there.<br/>
<br/>
As far as listing ... I think my boxes are all on both sites, but I haven't<br/>
planted since fall. I'm not a big planter, so I might keep using both sites<br/>
in that regard. Not sure.</div>

searches or outings.  We have had the best experiences when we consult <br/>
both sites for potential boxes.  There is a fair amount of cross posting <br/>
of clues.<br/>

You will find some boxes available on only one of the sites, so it<br/>
helps to cross reference them both when searching an area.<br/>
We find AQ to be better for communicating with others.  E-mailing<br/>
is made easy and the message posting boards are a lot of fun.<br/>
Gatherings are listed in an nice orderly fashion and there seems to be<br/>
an unlimited wealth of shared knowledge if you have any questions<br/>
or problems.  Blog sites and links are available for all sorts of <br/>
supplies like carving mediums, tools, patches, T shirts etc.  Also lots<br/>
of good tutorial info, statistics and glossary pages.<br/>
<br/>
In a nut shell, we find LBNA to be more basic and "traditional".<br/>
AQ has may more playful features and is more "modern".<br/>
Both are good for finding clues and logging in boxes.  It's really<br/>
just a matter of personal preference!<br/>

</span></blockquote>AQ searches are not limited to city based searches.  While some boxes <br/>
are assigned to arbitrary points within a city because specific <br/>
locations are not yet (or never will be) listed, many boxes have <br/>
location data that allows for some useful search methods and results.  <br/>
The ability to search for boxes within a given radius from where I am, <br/>
or where I plan to be, can be very useful.  I would contend that this is <br/>
a more useful method of "area search" than county boarders, which can be <br/>
very arbitrary.  For example, on AQ a 25 mile radius search from my home <br/>
is all one page and I can sort by distance if I so choose.  On LbNA I <br/>
have to review two seperate regions, find the towns that are within that <br/>
approximate distance and not a hundred miles away, and compile my own <br/>
list.  Near home, that is not a big deal. When travelling, it can <br/>
require more research and effort.  I like that research, so I do it, but <br/>
if I am in a hurry, I go to the AQ search first.<br/>

<br/>
<a href="http://ryancarpenter.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ryancarpenter.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
More about the evolution of AQ can be found on AQ itself, here:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/aboutus/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/aboutus/</a><br/>
<br/>
I personally see AQ as a continuing attempt at building a robust tool to <br/>
assist with the practice of this hobby.  I am new, but I do recognize <br/>
that LbNA has a deeper connection to the 'feel' of the letterboxing <br/>
experience, if you will.  The AQ tools, while powerful, are occasionally <br/>
not as user friendly as they might be, and the design is sometimes <br/>
downright quirky.  It seems that some appreciate and love that <br/>
quirkiness, while others don't.  One great thing about AQ is that it is <br/>
highly customizable to meet your needs, but you have to be kind of geeky <br/>
to use and appreciate some of those options.<br/>

  This interview by Mark Pepe give some insight into the roots of AQ:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://ryancarpenter.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ryancarpenter.blogspot.com/</a><br/>

  More about the evolution of AQ can be found on AQ itself, here:<br/>

<br/>
  I personally see AQ as a continuing attempt at building a robust tool to <br/>
  assist with the practice of this hobby. I am new, but I do recognize <br/>
  that LbNA has a deeper connection to the 'feel' of the letterboxing <br/>
  experience, if you will. The AQ tools, while powerful, are occasionally <br/>
  not as user friendly as they might be, and the design is sometimes <br/>
  downright quirky. It seems that some appreciate and love that <br/>
  quirkiness, while others don't. One great thing about AQ is that it is <br/>
  highly customizable to meet your needs, but you have to be kind of geeky <br/>
  to use and appreciate some of those options.<br/>
