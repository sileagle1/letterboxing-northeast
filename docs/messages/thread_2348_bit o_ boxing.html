grab a couple of local boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Lisha Kills Preserve series - We found the Protector of Hidden <br/>
Treasures and he's a cute little bugger. Box and all in good shape. We <br/>
missed the other box, but have been assured that it was there a couple <br/>
of days earlier, so we may go back for it.<br/>
<br/>
Lock 7 - cool stamp! We were also lucky enough to be there just as the <br/>
lockmaster started the process to let a small boat through, so Miss <br/>
Buggy got a quick engineering lesson along with a ncie day out and a <br/>
good stamp. :-)  Hardest part of this was the stealth factor - would <br/>
have been fine except that there was a couple sitting at the nearby <br/>
picnic bench and they just wouldn't respond to the brainwave-based plea <br/>
to leave, darn them. We had to fake things like rocks in our shoes and <br/>
wait for them to glance away so we could make another grab for the box. <br/>
Took several tries, but Miss Buggy was having fun putting her spy <br/>
skills to use. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the planters. It was such a nice day to be out and about.<br/>
