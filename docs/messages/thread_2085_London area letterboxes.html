fact, you can search out my own box that I planted there in Feb '05.  I <br/>
left a couple of HH's too, one in the city and one in a suburban nature <br/>
reserve.  The box I planted in the city is called The Beacon Across The <br/>
Pond.  It's easy to find and in a nice place, worth the trouble....and <br/>
there is another one nearby called Battle Box which is in an awesome <br/>
place!  Good luck.  <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-618621003">In February this year we found one box missing of the ones we searched <br/>
for.  It was the one located at the Brunswick Center near Russel <br/>
Square.  We did find Battle Box, Tourist Box and Nice Work.  Nice work <br/>
is the one outside of the city.  You need a car to get to the nature <br/>
preserve.  It's a nice walk in the countryside.  Good luck.  If you try <br/>
it, be sure to look for mine.....Beacon Across the Pond....and feel <br/>
free to email me about it!  I'd love to have word as to it's safety <br/>
and/or progress or demise. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks.  Paplela<br/>
