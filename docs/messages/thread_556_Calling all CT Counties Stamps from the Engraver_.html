<br/>
Could those of you who took The Engraver's generous offer of a CT <br/>
County stamp, please read the info below?<br/>
<br/>
The Engraver asked me to coordinate the clues so that we all call it <br/>
the same thing and have some kind of continuity to the series. We <br/>
have decided to call it the "CT State Stamp Series - XXXXXXXX County" <br/>
with, of course, replacing the XXXXXXXX's with your county's name. <br/>
Once they are all hidden and posted to the LBNA website, I will open <br/>
up a subpage for them on our website.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could drop me an email once you have posted them in case I <br/>
miss the announcement of the posting.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and . . . <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
<br/>
Mark Pepe<br/>
