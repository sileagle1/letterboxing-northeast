This entails writing about his travels in a journal and if you are up to it including a few pictures.  It also includes keeping him safe.  We do not want him lost on his journey.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to ask if anyone is willing to host him for a week.  I would like to get two people in different states, that way he will have visited four states before returning home.  Please email me if your willing to take him in.  He kind of reminds me of a postal box. :)<br/>
