                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2117428502">I happened to walk by the location of this great box (the second I ever <br/>
found) last week and saw that it had been exposed due to an enormous tree <br/>
falling on and breaking the rock formation it was hidden in. The <br/>
landscapers at Cornell are very industrious and I knew the box would be in <br/>
jeopardy if left there while the tree was being removed, so I brought it <br/>
home and contacted the owners. I'm very sad to report that they've decided <br/>
to retire the box for good and I'll be giving it (and its three very full <br/>
logbooks) back to them on Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who weren't lucky enough to visit it, Plantations was <br/>
planted by TRIO in September 2001 and was one of the oldest surviving boxes <br/>
in NY (and hidden on a gorgeous little creekside path, to boot). Just in <br/>
case anyone had already printed out clues in anticipation of looking for it <br/>
while in Ithaca for the Finger Lakes gathering on June 11th, be forewarned <br/>
that the clues have been removed from LBNA and the box is gone.<br/>
<br/>
It will be missed...<br/>
