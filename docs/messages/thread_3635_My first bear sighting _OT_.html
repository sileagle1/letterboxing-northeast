                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1585720626">Be very careful this time of year in regards to bears.  Right now the <br/>
foraging is at high speed to pack on the pounds and with apples ripe, <br/>
they seem to be everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
 The cubs are getting out and starting to wander a bit further from <br/>
mom than before, so it's easy to get between a mom and her cub(s) <br/>
without even realizing there are cubs in the area.<br/>
<br/>
It's sad and unfortunate that a mom and one of her cubs were <br/>
dispatched recently by someone I know because the mom kept bringing <br/>
them to the house to forage the apple trees not 15 feet from the back <br/>
door.  She wasn't shy and started coming around during daylight <br/>
hours.  After having to carry a 357 magnum each time they went out of <br/>
the house (and using same gun to shoot over their heads trying, <br/>
unsuccessfully, to scare them away) this person ended up calling <br/>
another hunter to take care of the issue.<br/>

in Maine years ago. We've had reports of sightings here in N Windham on <br/>
the airline trail that runs behind Walmart through the Cedar Bog where <br/>
we have one of our boxes. <br/>
