<br/>
I want to direct you to an awesome website that sells some rather <br/>
unique and creative acrylic stamps. I have purchased 4 sets and <br/>
donated them to Compassion International where children in the <br/>
Dominican Republic are enjoying the wonderful art of stamping, that as <br/>
letterboxers, we absolutely love to do. You can see several photos in <br/>
the gallery of this website. The stamps are perfect for children and <br/>
quite simple to use and easy to clean. I am sure you won't be <br/>
disappointed should you purchase stamps from Big Foot and Pickle Face <br/>
Creations.<br/>
