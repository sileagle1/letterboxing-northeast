letterboxers. I hate to start the "you've gotta try this box" advice <br/>
with "don't bother with this one," but we don't recommend our own <br/>
letterboxes right there in Bristol RI. They're trashed, unmaintained, <br/>
and have crummy store bought stamps. We're way overdue for an update <br/>
on them. But have fun in Rhode Island!<br/>

me know.<br/>
<br/>
My recent favorite series in RI is Alice in Wonderland (in Washington <br/>
County.)  The stamps are lovely hand carved stamps.  The trail is one <br/>
of my favorites in RI too.  A couple of the boxes may give you some <br/>
trouble finding (The land marks are not real clear) but worth the <br/>
drive from Bristol.  It is best to take two cars though so you can <br/>
just walk one way.  If you do go out to Washington County there are <br/>
lots of other boxes in the general area too.  I could set up an <br/>
iterary for you that would keep you boxing for weeks LOL.<br/>
