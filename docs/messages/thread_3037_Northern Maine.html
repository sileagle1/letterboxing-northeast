Hard to spot at first as you get to the smaller planets on the way up.  Went to Aroostock County last summer and really enjoyed these boxes.<br/>

good one.  I hope to have a few boxes planted in the Island Falls area before <br/>
summer is over, but I seem to be spending valuable boxing time helping my husband <br/>
with maintenance of our camp and town place.  Rain seems to be getting in and <br/>
staying in and rotting wood where never have there been leaks before.  <br/>
<br/>
Did you get to do any boxing?<br/>

County trip.  And kstar -- would have liked to have hooked up with you <br/>
too.  We don't get a lot of action up this way so it would be great to <br/>
meet up with those of you who actually make the journey.  Sorry about <br/>
that.  kstar, I see you did some planting way up north.  I'll have to <br/>
check that out.  If anyone else decides to make it up here please email <br/>
me directly as I'm much more likely to receive the message in a timely <br/>
fashion.  Hope you enjoyed the boxes and your trip.<br/>
