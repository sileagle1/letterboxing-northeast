will cooperate. I'll be crossing my fingers. I hope to see a few <br/>
familiar faces up at the pavillion in 5 days. Remember, due to the <br/>
location of the pavillion, there is NO pot luck. So don't forget to <br/>
bring a snack for yourself. If anyone knows of a good resturaunt in <br/>
the area where we may be able to eat afterwards, let me know. Make <br/>
sure to keep your eyes peeled for the clues on Saturday evening!<br/>
