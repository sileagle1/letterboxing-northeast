                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-411254144">This May I will be walking nearly 40 miles over two days as a <br/>
participant in the Boston Avon Walk for Breast Cancer.  I am honored <br/>
to be walking with thousands of others who have made the same <br/>
courageous commitment to help raise awareness and funding for this <br/>
devastating disease. Together, we will sleep in tents, shower in semi-<br/>
trucks and push ourselves far beyond what we ever thought we were <br/>
capable of doing.<br/>
<br/>
	Why am I doing this?  Well, let me tell you my story.  In <br/>
February 2006 I found a lump.  At my next prenatal appointment <br/>
(That's right, I was pregnant. 7 months to be exact.) I brought it up <br/>
with my doctor.  She sent me for an ultrasound of the mass. That led <br/>
to a biopsy which then led to a mammogram. Two days later I was being <br/>
told I had breast cancer and that I would need a modified radical <br/>
mastectomy.  Cancer, at 33.  Who would have thought? And while <br/>
pregnant.  I can't tell you how scared I was.  But both the baby and <br/>
I had no trouble with the surgery.  Eight weeks later (3 weeks after <br/>
the baby's birth) I started chemotherapy. I had 8 chemo treatments <br/>
over 16 weeks throughout the summer.  During the fall I had 30 <br/>
treatments of radiation.  I am now on hormone therapy and feeling <br/>
great.  I am grateful for the science and research that allowed me <br/>
the treatments to make a full recovery.  Unfortunately, while I made <br/>
my recovery, others were diagnosed with breast cancer about every 3 <br/>
minutes.  <br/>
<br/>
	Now I'm on a mission.  The more people I talk to and the more <br/>
money I raise to fund the fight against breast cancer- the sooner the <br/>
numbers of women being diagnosed will start lowering and the sooner a <br/>
cure will be found.  I truly believe that finding a cure to one <br/>
cancer will be the key to unraveling the mysteries of many cancers.  <br/>
Too many people have had their lives torn apart by this disease.  I <br/>
refuse to idly sit by and watch it happen.  So why will I walk?  <br/>
Because I can, and because I need to.  My commitment has become part <br/>
of my healing process.  And the event itself will also play a huge <br/>
part of that process.<br/>
<br/>
            To participate in this event I am required to raise a <br/>
minimum of $1800 by April 20th.  I have made it my personal goal to <br/>
double that amount to $3600.  This is where you come in.  There are <br/>
two ways you can donate to the cause and support my efforts.  You can <br/>
go to <br/>

<br/>
It will lead you to a page where you can pledge online by credit or <br/>
debit card either as a one time gift or a  pledge overtime.  You can <br/>
also mail a check made out to AVON WALK FOR BREAST CANCER directly to <br/>
me and let me do the paperwork for you.  Either way your (tax <br/>
deductible) gift will be appreciated more than I can possibly tell <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
	One of the things I discovered as I was going through my own <br/>
cancer experience is that I am blessed with an amazing circle of <br/>
family and friends.  This was shown to me over and over as people <br/>
came out of the woodwork to offer love and support like I have never <br/>
seen before.  I feel privileged to have so many wonderful people in m <br/>
life.  This event is one way that I can try to offer some of that <br/>
support back to those who need it now.  I feel like its the least I <br/>
can do.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance,<br/>
