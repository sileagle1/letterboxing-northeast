coast region. We hope to visit AmyMisha's new boxes, Casco Bay Painter's recent <br/>
Farnsworth edition and many others. If anyone wants to meet us along the way for <br/>
some boxing fun - please let us know!<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, those of you in southern states (ie: CT, NH, MA) look for signs of spring <br/>
along your walks this weekend. Spring vernal pools will be emerging soon. Big night <br/>
has already happened in some portions of new england, we will be on the lookout for <br/>
frog and salamander crossings!<br/>
<br/>
And just as if things couldn't get any better, an extra hour of available daylight for <br/>
letterboxing will be added to your evening this weekend as daylight savings time <br/>
takes place tomorrow! Don't forget to set your clocks ahead...<br/>
