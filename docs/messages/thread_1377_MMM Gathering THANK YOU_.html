and all of the others who made the MMM a HUGE success!  I had a wonderful time <br/>
and you did a fantastic job!  I'm hoping to get back to Mansfield this <br/>
afternoon with PSU Fan to hit more boxes!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
It was also nice to see so many new faces!  A few of these new faces actually <br/>
were not so new faces that I knew from long ago!  Who would have thought that <br/>
Zia would have been my third grade teacher???????  How cool is that!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for a great day!!!!<br/>

organization of the day of fun in Mansfield.  It was wonderful to<br/>
meet so many of you yet there are many more to meet.  Will have to do<br/>
it again sometime.  Will have to get back there sometime before the<br/>
month is over.<br/>
