<br/>
I would like to do some outtings. I will be 49 in 2 weeks, and live in <br/>
Sudbury. I have been boxing since April, but have almost 80 boxes now ! <br/>
I sometimes go with my children, but like to go alone.<br/>
My husband doesn't do it :)<br/>

<br/>
I was wondering if anyone has heard from pH, or knows how to get in <br/>
touch with him.<br/>
All his boxes are up for adoption on Atlasquest as he hasn't posted in a <br/>
year.<br/>
There is one particular box, Vinland Ship, that I would be interested in <br/>
adopting. One of the compass points is missing a number, which means <br/>
that it is very hard to find.<br/>
(I found it accidentally on my way out) I would like to repost the <br/>
correct clues, but  I don't want to swipe anyone's box who is just <br/>
taking a breather.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1063533756">i don't know what the ethical question to this is, i only know what i would<br/>
and do in the case of a missing planter. <br/>
<br/>
first i make every effort to contact the placer. if the box is in the<br/>
basement then i adopt it. if it is not in the basement, but is listed on<br/>
lbna, atlas quest, or any other personal site i do not adopt it. rather i <br/>
foster care" it. check on it when i check on my own, replace what is needed<br/>
etc. <br/>
<br/>
i would be very hesitant to adopt a box that has an owner, whether or not<br/>
that owner is available or not. perhaps atlas quest is just not the persons<br/>
cup of tea and they have stopped using it, perhaps they don't have a<br/>
computer anymore, or perhaps they just don't care. what ever the case it is<br/>
their box until they themselves let go of it. <br/>
<br/>
in my own opinion i would rather see the boxes get deleted from atlas quest<br/>
before i saw them go up for adoption. <br/>
