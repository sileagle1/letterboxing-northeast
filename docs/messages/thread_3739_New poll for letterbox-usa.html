Enter your vote today!  A new poll has been created for the <br/>
letterbox-usa group:<br/>
<br/>
How do you feel about talking with the Land Manager of the park, <br/>
preserve, forest, etc. where letterboxes are planted in your area?  <br/>
Check all that apply. <br/>
<br/>
  o The land is open to the public and I have a right to plant boxes <br/>
there. <br/>
  o I would rather pull all my boxes than talk to the Manager. <br/>
  o I have been confronted by a Manager or Officer and a fine or <br/>
penalty was imposed against me. <br/>
  o Don't ask don't tell. <br/>
  o My letterbox was blown up by the Bomb Squad. <br/>
  o All Managers are opposed to letterboxing. <br/>
  o I don't know / am scared about how he/she will respond. <br/>
  o I will talk with the Manager if I have to, but I would prefer <br/>
going to the dentist. <br/>
  o I will get arrested. <br/>
  o I would be apprehensive /scared if I received an email from the <br/>
Manager. <br/>
  o It is easier to ask forgiveness than permission. <br/>
  o Law Enforcement was summoned to my letterbox. <br/>
  o If I knew what policy was in place, I would feel more confident. <br/>
  o The Manager may like letterboxing, but I will not be the one to <br/>
explain it to him/her. <br/>
  o Letterboxing brings nice visitors, so I would want the Manager to <br/>
appreciate that. <br/>
  o I would feel better if another letterboxer went with me. <br/>
  o I have spoken with Managers, and some are opposed to <br/>
letterboxing. <br/>
  o I have spoken with Managers, and some are in favor of <br/>
letterboxing. <br/>
  o There is no obvious / can't find the Manager at some parks or <br/>
preserves. <br/>
  o The Manager is an outdoors person like us, and will like <br/>
letterboxing when I explain it to him/her. <br/>
