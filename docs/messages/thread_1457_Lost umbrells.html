Preserve looking for the Vampire series along with others in the<br/>
area.  Stuck my umbrella in the back of my pack, but it fell out<br/>
somewhere along the way.  If anyone comes upon a navy blue umbrella,<br/>
I'd appreciate hearing from you and hopefully getting it back.  <br/>
<br/>
We had a very successful morning finding 13 boxes plus a hitch hiker<br/>
up there and didn't get rained on.  Made 14 more finds on other<br/>
trails and an exchange before I had to return home.<br/>
