Ham's (D&amp;D) friends for spending a Saturday afternoon entertaining a <br/>
bunch of letterboxers!!!<br/>
<br/>
Second thank you D&amp;D for planning the event and organizing it to a tee! <br/>
Because you used a "shot gun start" (like they do in golf tournaments) <br/>
things went real smooth! <br/>
<br/>
Finally, if you plan it they will come to box!!! Thank you for every <br/>
one being there.  for some of us it was a long trip.  I just got <br/>
home...of course I boxed my way back but doesn't everyone?<br/>
