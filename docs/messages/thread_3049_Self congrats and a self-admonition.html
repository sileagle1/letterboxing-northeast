                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-636028755">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to talk about my boxing adventure today, in Leominster.<br/>
<br/>
I was really close to 100 boxes, and I had told myself I would get them <br/>
this vacation, and then it was July 3rd, and I picked a series that <br/>
included 14.<br/>
Now, I should have known better than to take my 9 and 6 year old (almost <br/>
7...) on a 14 box hike. I had no map, and so I was really reliant on the <br/>
clues.<br/>
We got about 1/2 of the way before the first clue before my youngest, <br/>
started objecting, but I made him press on, as I didn't know how to pick <br/>
of the clues on the way back from  where I was..<br/>
plus I really wanted to get those boxes. I promised ice cream, museum <br/>
(it was closed), and just pushed him along. The older one was tired, but <br/>
quiet.<br/>
We finally got to what I thought was the halfway point, (It turned out <br/>
to be much farther along than I thought). We had been at it for 4 hours!!<br/>
I had brought only one bottle of water, that I refilled in a brook, and <br/>
no food. I was lucky I had started out early.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I realized we were much farther along, and the kids kept <br/>
walking, while I darted to the boxes, stamped in quickly and caught up <br/>
with them, but on the second to last box,<br/>
my youngest came screaming back to me at the top of his lungs! He had <br/>
seen a *head* and he was terrified. I walked with him, and found a <br/>
doll's head on the side of the trail. Someone had<br/>
polked two holes in the forehead, and there was matted hair on it. I <br/>
could easily see how a young child could mistake this for a real head. <br/>
We looked at it together and put it in a bag at the bottom of my pack.<br/>
I thought someone had put it there to scare someone, but my husband <br/>
thinks it just looks abandonned.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we made it out without further incident, but I am chastising <br/>
myself, for bad planning, and for wanting the boxes more than I cared to <br/>
make it a safe and appropriate trip for my kids.<br/>
We did stop at Friendly's and then two drive bys before we got back on <br/>
the road, so the last memories will be good ones.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I got my hundred :)<br/>
But I learned a lesson!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1995328766">Now that the hike is over, (and thankfully everyone's rested) it sounds like one of those <br/>
family stories that'll continue to pop up throughout time. Our Mom took us on a hike once <br/>
where the police had to find us because we got so lost. We definitely have a laugh over <br/>
that one now! Congratulations on the 100th!!!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>
