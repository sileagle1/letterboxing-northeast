I have never found a box in a hole that was dug.  Boxes are always in an<br/>
area that already exists.  Under a log and debris for example.  And yes,<br/>
putting your hand into a tree can be scary, but we have survived it so far,<br/>
and we tend to poke around with a stick first :)<br/>

As far as a email complaining about reaching into a tree or <br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-696961823">I recently planted 2 boxes by removing pine needles, covering the box with them, and marking the spot with small stones on top. I doubt I have done any harm, and anyone who reads the clues will be looking for the rocks, not digging willy-nilly in the woods. Someone accidentall finding the random rocks under the pine and moving them is likely to walk away scratching his head. Some people think that hiding a box in a stone wall will cause the collapse of the wall. I don't think it necessarilly will, and some mighty good and careful 'boxers hide in walls. Now, if a searcher rips up and destroys the wall, but most, as we know, DO NOT, then the searcher is an oaf (moron).  YMMV<br/>
<br/>
I don't think you can assume that most park managers don't like letterboxers because they dig holes, as most letterboxers don't.  I can't assume why any manager dislikes hide and seek activities in the parks (I don't think most state mgrs. in CT feel this way) but I could take a guess that someone high up in the pecking order sets the tone and policies even if they've never had a box on their property, because they FEAR damage to delicate areas and species and don't want to regret allowing harm come to anything. I can understand that, but it begs the question, why not do more to educate people and clearly mark delicate areas, and post earth-friendly signs depicting things that should not be disturbed and *why*?  Land management of public parks should be more about promoting good use and less about keeping people and activities out. JMHO<br/>
<br/>
Does moving a small section of forest floor debris (needles, natural mulch) to plant a box really cause any harm to that tree or the ecosystem?  You can go down a few inches without touching roots.  Thoughts?  <br/>

Let the flames begin.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-341989711">I think this is not a simple dilemma.  Whether the place or method of hiding is appropriate or not depends as much on the hider as the location.  Rearranging some pine needles and fallen sticks and bark is different than digging a hole.  Finding an existing space in an old stone wall is different from finding an existing cranny that is big enough to hold your letterbox.  Planting a box in an area easily within reach of a path and very obvious (once clues have been followed) is very different from ambiguous clues that require a lot of tramping around.  I have found letterboxes from beginners that were done with great regard for the environment and others by some of the big names in letterboxing that guaranteed harm.  I have given up on some that brought me to a point that I did not feel right continuing, because I was not willing to go off trail or onto private property. And, no matter how careful planters are, there will always be seekers who are not careful.  That said, <br/>
 in an attempt to reduce the impact when I am creating a box, I try to keep in mind a couple of things when deciding on a location:  Does planting here have the potential to anger or offend anyone?  Does planting here have a reasonable potential to cause harm to the environment?  Are my clues and method of cover done in such a way that once someone gets to the location, the actual hiding place of the box is obvious to "the trained eye"?<br/>
<br/>
  It will never be possible to absolutely guarantee that our planting of letterboxes will not  harm the environment, because we truly have no control over them once they leave our hands.  All we can do is make every effort to plant our letterboxes in such a way as to minimize the impact on the environment.  That is what I have always understood as being at the heart of letterboxing, and is one of the things that endears the hobby to me!<br/>
