Flutterby has offered her house as a mid-day stopping point.  Anyone who is <br/>
willing/able to bring some snacks to share with the group for a pot-luck would <br/>

we'll let you know where it is during the event.  (For some reason she'd <br/>
rather me not post her address here...  hmm...)<br/>

I still have not received the event stamp.  I was told that Jude was going to <br/>
carve it?  Jude, please contact me off the list.  :)  I'm sure you've got it <br/>

bonus box in one of my Lebanon boxes for the Winter Drive. I will tell<br/>
you that the box the clues are in is on the list to be visited, but that<br/>
is all I will tell you. See you on Sunday!<br/>

P.S. It should not interfere with the order that the boxes are in.<br/>
