<br/>
It is my birthday weekend coming up and I'm going to Beverly, MA <br/>
to visit my folks. I have told them I want to go letterboxing in the <br/>
area for my birthday.  Any suggestions on which one to go to?  <br/>
There are some in Salem (the next town over from my folks) or  <br/>
should i try some in Gloucester, MA?  <br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for an easy to find box, with a nice set of clues - and <br/>
hopefully a nice stamp.  My daughter and I spent a wonderful <br/>
Rosh Hashanah looking for the three bears in Billerica, Ma.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder why people haven't put any boxes in Hamilton or <br/>
Wenham, MA there are some nice parks there<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>

<br/>
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!<br/>
<br/>
We have done almost every North Shore Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
The ones in Salem are drivebys. The tricky part of the Playground series is<br/>
the discreetness. They are in pretty open spaces, and if there are kids<br/>
playing it may almost be impossible. BUT lucky or unlucky for you gals, it<br/>
will be raining Saturday and Sunday. Give them a try.<br/>
<br/>
There is the Alien Limited Time letterbox on Winter Island. This has some<br/>
nice views of the ocean (ignore the power plant behind the park) but it can<br/>
be a 30 minute walk on the road if you don't want to pay the $15 parking.<br/>
<br/>
The Good and Bad Series is only the Bad now. But an easy drive by. How do I<br/>
know this? We planted these.<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, the Witch Trails/Bridget letterbox has been long missing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
THAN there's Rockport. I would go to Rockport more than Gloucester. A bit<br/>
farther but beautiful views of the ocean. Halibut Point has three. These are<br/>
a bit more of a walk, but only an hour and a half  tops, and that's getting<br/>
three different stamps from different people, without enjoying the views.<br/>
BUT THE OCEAN! Even in the rain!<br/>
<br/>
PLUS near downtown Rockport, Frodo's Voyage, Pirate something, Frog Pond.<br/>
ALL worth a good visit. Spend a day in Rockport and you have got all these<br/>
boxes plus Legolas which is a bit farther down the road past downtown.<br/>
<br/>
Than there''s Lynn. One in Marblehead.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this will keep you people busy.<br/>
<br/>
If you finish those, there's always Newburyport!<br/>
<br/>
ENJOY!!<br/>
<br/>
