well.  The hike is long, but definitely worth it- the sites are <br/>
phenomenal!!!  The first box is Jay's first handcarved stamp--You've <br/>
come a long way, Jay!!  Waterproof footgear is a must right now. Three <br/>
year old "Boo" made it all the way to the first box on foot (we did <br/>
take a shortcut) before hopping in the stroller, and he enjoyed the <br/>
sites,too. The logbooks are in good shape, but you may want to bring <br/>
your own stamppads- one is dried out and the other is totally soaked.<br/>
The absence of some of the more dedicated boxers from these logs was <br/>
rather surprising :0) Happy boxing- Sunshine, Swamp Yankee, Boo, and <br/>

Clan letterbox! <br/>
<br/>
Interesting observation about established folks not in that log -- <br/>
we've actually had those clues on our to-do list forever and just never <br/>
get to Colchester in general. <br/>
<br/>
Funny how that works sometimes!<br/>
