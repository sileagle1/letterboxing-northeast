taking the time to notify me about the box.  It is not<br/>
my box there at the 'nose'  but I will forward the sad<br/>
news to the planter.  I have a notion to post your<br/>
letter on the LBNA talk list as it speaks hightly of<br/>
Geocachers and sometimes in these hobbies , we do<br/>
'lock horns ! !  Would you mind ?<br/>
