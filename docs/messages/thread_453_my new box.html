Will someone please go to my new box In killingworth CT? Almost three <br/>
weeks after its placement and only one person has been there.(If this <br/>
is usual tell me because this is my first box on more than a half hours <br/>
hike.) If no one goes there in the next two weeks(unless someone tells <br/>
me its normal) im going to pull it and put it closer to the park roads. <br/>
Not too close though.<br/>

</span></blockquote>If it requires an actual honest-to-goodness hike to get to, it's <br/>
very normal for it not to get many visitors.  For whatever reason <br/>
(lack of time, lack of physical fitness, or even 'power boxers' that <br/>
want lots of boxes in as minimal amount of time possible), most <br/>
people won't look for a box that's not quick and easy.<br/>
<br/>
I've hidden boxes on hikes that take less than an hour to do, and <br/>
they might get one visit per YEAR.  Astonishing, really.  And for <br/>
those boxes I've hidden that take three or four hours to do, they've <br/>
gone for two years or more without a visit!<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, if you want your boxes to get lots of visitors, you'll have <br/>
to hide them closer to roads.  But I hope you leave it where it is.  <br/>
There's a severe lack of letterboxes on serious hikes for those few <br/>
of us (such as myself) that prefer them to the drive-bys.  <br/>
Eventually somebody will get out to find it, but it could take <br/>
awhile.<br/>

<br/>
I would recommend that you not expect hoards of people to come to your box <br/>
right away. If you have such high expectations, you may find yourself <br/>
disappointed. Some boxes are heavily visitied (several people a month), others can go a <br/>
year or more with out a single visitor, especially tough mystery boxes. When <br/>
we sought out one particular mystery, we were the first ones to find it, and it <br/>
had been there for a year already!<br/>
<br/>
Sure, there are folks who rush right out to a new box, because they like to <br/>
be the first finder, but a lot of us plan our letterboxing trips more casually <br/>
than that. It sounds like your box is in a great spot. A half hour is not too <br/>
far to go for lots of people. I think you have done exactly what you should <br/>
do....let people know it is there and invite them to visit it.<br/>
<br/>
You know how the saying goes..."if you plant it, they will come".<br/>
<br/>
Just remember that southern New England has literally thousands of boxes to <br/>
choose from. CSCM and I are particularly focusing on the older ones, so that we <br/>
can get them before they are retired or go missing. I know there are some <br/>
others doing that too.<br/>
<br/>
So don't worry, they will come...just maybe not as quickly as you hoped.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-831206742">Very good point! Our "Gray Rock Extras" has had minimal visitors in <br/>
the past year and a half. Outside of the 'usual suspects', we've seen <br/>
maybe 8 or 10 visitors. Compare this to one of our drive-up-easy-<br/>
access-to-I-95 boxes and you will see that in about 8 months we've <br/>
had 40 or 50 entries into the easier box. We've even had to make a <br/>
new logbook b/c the old one filled up in about 2 months.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if its reflective of the state of letterboxing in CT, <br/>
however it seems like boxes in the hot spots like Rocky Neck, Haley <br/>
Farm, Mansfield, Goodwin, etc get far more attention and there are <br/>
far more boxes in those areas. Of course on the flip side these parks <br/>
offer some of the more difficult hikes (thinking of Ants Marching in <br/>
Goodwin). <br/>
<br/>
Lou - Give it time to settle. Also keep in mind that some people take <br/>
pride in putting out boxes that no one CAN find!  Chalk it up to a <br/>
good box location and the idea that the few people that come get your <br/>
stamp image are the lucky ones.  We treasure some of the seldom found <br/>
dilemmas in this state. <br/>

Nota Bene - I'd go get this box just to make ya happy but its <br/>
supposed to rain all week! Perhaps next week Maddie and STeve will <br/>
make the trek! <br/>
