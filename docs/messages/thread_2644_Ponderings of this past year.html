found that Every artist was at first an amateur, and that People <br/>
only see what they are prepared to see. There is a neat little book <br/>
I have found in a local library that has a good grasp for words and <br/>
shows me that There is creative writing as well as creative <br/>
reading... Some books leave us free and some books make us free<br/>
Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm!  The miracles of <br/>
genius always rest on profound convictions which refuse to be <br/>
analyzed, Don't be too timid and squeamish about your actions!  I <br/>
have learned that All life is an experiment! Trust your instinct to <br/>
the end, though you can render no reason.  Everything in Nature <br/>
contains all the powers of Nature. Everything is made of hidden <br/>
stuff The reward of a thing well done is having done it! <br/>
<br/>
To me, Letterboxing embodies all these assets.<br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year to All<br/>
