                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-714131160">Alright folks - be honest here - how many of you went boxing this<br/>
weekend? I know that it's a fair number of you in CT at least, but for<br/>
folks up this way in Maine I made a few observations when I was out today.<br/>
<br/>
1) ROCKS <br/>
Yes, rocks - not so much the snow tracks to the box- forget that,<br/>
you're already openly going after that box to begin with - at that<br/>
point, who cares about the tracks? <br/>
<br/>
I'm talking about rocks that cover the spot - they're frozen to the<br/>
ground. They are truly hard to dislodge from their frozen cubby to<br/>
extract a box from. Has anyone else experienced this terrible tragedy?<br/>
<br/>
and <br/>
<br/>
2) STUMPS<br/>
Need a bit of R&amp;D on this one, but how about a sawed off stump that<br/>
has an additonal 1-2 inch thick layer sawed off and then hinged? yes,<br/>
the hinge might be more obvious but it would make for a great natural<br/>
cover and hiding spot inside. You could potentially use black coated<br/>
hinges so that they would be less obvious. One would need the<br/>
necessary tools to procure a sliced off section of stump and<br/>
additionally you might have to hollow out the stump in the middle. ok-<br/>
perhaps this is too much work...<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts on these items?<br/>
Happy winter boxing,<br/>

were only slightly frozen with no snow on them.  I was able to pry <br/>
loose easily but I did smash a finger when the box suddenly "gave."  <br/>
I didn't have my first aid kit or any paper towels or tissues with me <br/>
since I was only going out for one quick letterbox.  I got blood all <br/>
over my log book (the finger bled a lot ... yuk!)  but managed to <br/>
keep the blood off Laurette's beautiful new log book (I hope.) .... <br/>
moral of the story ... don't use your fingers to loosen frozen <br/>
rocks ... or if you do, keep your fingers out from between the rocks. <br/>

<br/>
Hey all! I hope everyone is well!<br/>
<br/>
Now I've had a long day and my brain is tired, so after reading this I'm not <br/>
sure if you are being serious or joking (so please forgive me if I took this <br/>
wrong) , but all that comes to mind is the "leave no trace" philosophy. Not <br/>
covering up snow footprints is one thing (it's silly to hope that one could <br/>
succeed at that), but all out construction of stump storage boxes in the woods? To <br/>
me that goes against my "leave it as you found it" mentality. As for prying up <br/>
frozen rocks, I guess my tendency is to leave them alone if I cannot move it <br/>
without a lever or prying bar. I've helped to repair stone walls...they are <br/>
easy to "topple" and a real hefty amount of work to repair. Anyway, that was my <br/>
first, gut reaction...<br/>
<br/>
Wishing I had gone boxing this weekend...<br/>

  Try letterboxing with a family circus type boy -there are so many <br/>
footprints to every interesting rock and tree an obstacle that  one <br/>
might never suspect any were to a definate destination.  I have even <br/>
been known to make a few un-needed side trips in the name of to many <br/>
