to pepe and davidow (which has this site located there). Any new <br/>
boxers will discover it when they search yahoo under letterboxing. <br/>
And, of course, there is always WOM!! : )<br/>
<br/>
However, this is a good point.  Maybe a poll on this suggestion is <br/>
needed? Either that or a post made at the LbNA talk site should be <br/>
made. <br/>
