Cozy Cavy¡¦s HH Hostel<br/>
<br/>
Cozy Cavy¡¦s is the place to be if you are a weary traveler, looking <br/>
to rest in a comfortable cranny until it is time to head back out on <br/>
the trail again. I have prepared the perfect little locale, tucked <br/>
away from all the commotion of everyday life.  So, please, join me <br/>
for a little R &amp; R! You¡¦ll feel so much better. Don¡¦t forget, <br/>
though, that in order to make room for you, your driver must take <br/>
another traveler with him/her. This is a snug little spot, only room <br/>
for 2!<br/>
<br/>
To find me, head your driver in the following direction:<br/>
<br/>
Find your way to Portland, CT. Via Route 9 North or South, take Exit <br/>
16 (under the bridge in Middletown) and follow Route 17 North over <br/>
the Arrigoni Bridge. Take your first left at the Hess Gas Station <br/>
onto Silver Street. Follow Silver Street to the end and merge right <br/>
onto Brownstone Avenue.  (It¡¦s not a pretty area up by the road, but <br/>
its beautiful down by the quarry!) Look to your right and see the <br/>
beautiful quarries? My Hostel is hidden in there!<br/>
<br/>
Park and the gate or along the road and walk in. I am easy to find, <br/>
a drive-by, you might say!  Walk onto the Promontory past the <br/>
information sign and take in the view, imagine for a minute what <br/>
this area might have looked like years ago while it was being <br/>
quarried.  When the river flooded back in the 1937 it created this <br/>
beautiful location I now call home! Standing at the flagpole facing <br/>
the water, find 40a. Walk in that direction to the edge of the <br/>
promontory and look down. My hole is in the wall directly below you. <br/>
You¡¦ll have to walk down there to find me. I have a triangular door <br/>
at about knee height and if you pull it out gently you¡¦ll find me <br/>
nestled inside.<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to have your driver log his/her visit also, then tuck us all <br/>
back into our safe little cranny! If your driver is looking for more <br/>
adventure, check out the Big Pine Letterbox further down on <br/>
Brownstone Avenue at the Portland Brownstone Quarries and Riverfront <br/>
Park!<br/>

About Hitch Hiker Hostels:<br/>
For those unfamiliar with hitchhiker hostels, they are letterboxes <br/>
with a stamp and logbook of their own, yet they also are guaranteed <br/>
to always contain a hitchhiker . However, YOU MAY ONLY TAKE A <br/>
HITCHHIKER IF YOU LEAVE ONE IN ITS PLACE. Please make sure to stamp <br/>
any hitchhikers you leave into the box logbook and stamp the box <br/>
stamp into the hitchhiker's logbook as well as leaving your personal <br/>
stamps in the box logbook.</div>
