organizers and helpers for the Monster Mash.  The event was fun for <br/>
all!  Thanks also to all those that sent boxes.  We have just found <br/>
a few so far, but it is wonderful to see the work of carvers from <br/>
across the country! We hope to be on the trails again today to find <br/>
some more wonderful boxes.  Again, a great big thank you for a <br/>
wonderful gathering! We enjoyed the boxing, the exchanges, the food, <br/>
the games and meeting more letterboxers!<br/>
