three published boxes there, and was made aware that there was a <br/>
fourth, much older box whose clues are no longer out there.  Don't <br/>
know if the box is or not.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I don't know whether I'll be able to attend the gathering as <br/>
a business trip looms for sometime in October, but I did enjoy the <br/>
view from the top of the Mount!  <br/>
