                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-810210783">The genie has already been out of the bottle for a long long time <br/>
regarding letterboxing and publicity.  Articles are published with or <br/>
without anyone's permission, from AAA to The Boston Globe to Time <br/>
Magazine.<br/>
<br/>
I've been planting letterboxes in three states since 2001, and I have <br/>
yet to see any vandalism done to any of my boxes since the influx of <br/>
publicity.<br/>
<br/>
I've got my boxes listed on both LbNA and AQ.  I have never pulled my <br/>
clues and I don't plan to, either.  I'm of the mindset that I want my <br/>
boxes found, and I deliberately plant them so that parents with <br/>
children can find them with undue hardship.  I plant for *everyone*.<br/>
<br/>
I do, however, applaud the creative letterboxers who have taken this <br/>
hobby to a different, underground level.  I've even been selected to <br/>
receive some very very *very* special WOM clues, for which I feel <br/>
quite honored.<br/>
<br/>
This hobby is continually evolving, and we should celebrate each <br/>
new "twist" as it comes about.  Celebrate diversity in letterboxing - <br/>
from plain old traditional LbNA clues to mystery boxes to AQ to <br/>
private websites to WOM boxes.  There's room for it all!<br/>

passed, the new people either pick it up and run with it, or it dies<br/>

something for everyone. I have had a rash of some of my favorite boxes<br/>
in my favorite spots go missing this year. If that happens, so what?<br/>
Either you replant and make the clues *less available* or you don't<br/>
plant. It's part of the fun.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully some of these new folks that pick it up will follow in our<br/>
footsteps with an appreciation for the finer elements of style.<br/>

<br/>
Seems a flame is happening every 3 or 4 weeks on the 'main list'.<br/>
<br/>
I've enjoyed LbNE because of the 'flame' free postings. <br/>
<br/>
Opinions, dialog and information are (were) freely given without <br/>
egos and/or personal attitudes intruding on the posts. <br/>
<br/>
It is not warranted and certanly not needed to trash a colleage in <br/>
the 'open'.<br/>
<br/>
After all, we are trying to be 'discrete'. lets not lose sight on <br/>
why we (and I) enjoy this hobby in the the first place.... nice <br/>
places, nice people, and a walk in nature.....</div>
