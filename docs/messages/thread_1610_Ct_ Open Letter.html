Today Lobsta and I took a walk at  Milo Light and for old times sake <br/>
went to Jay Drew's Milo Light box.  This was the first box that Lobsta <br/>
and I found and it began our obsession with this 'hobby'  The log book <br/>
was full and the Lady is charge of the Preserve had left a new log book <br/>
with a note saying  "Thanks to all who visit." That was so nice, and <br/>
since the box was now crowded with both log books,  I tucked the first <br/>
one in my pocket to give to Jay. What a Treasure !!  He planted it in <br/>
December of 1999.  There are so many stamps and names that are now <br/>
familiar and it was great fun to read .  I know that Jay will be  <br/>
pleased to see the enjoyment he has given to so many folks.   Now there <br/>
is a new log book, and fresh pages waiting ,  in Mark Pepe's words,  <br/>
"get out there and box " !<br/>
Jay,  I will hand this over to you with a big smile.<br/>

The land managers at Milo Light have been great about letterboxing in <br/>
their Nature Conservancy preserve. If anyone gets a chance to check <br/>
out Butterfly and Lobsta' boxes there, you're in for a treat.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the kind words, Jay<br/>
