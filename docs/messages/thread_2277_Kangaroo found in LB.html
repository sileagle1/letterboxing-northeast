                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1304245931">Today I took my sister, from MT, out letterboxing. We decided that we would  <br/>
do the series No! that I had planted in Wethersfield. When we went to box #6 <br/>
the  stamp was missing and inside the box was a beanie baby kangaroo. The thing <br/>
is  the box was partially open and the Kangaroo was sticking out. I think it <br/>
was  placed there in the last few days becuase it was completly dry and we had <br/>
 recently had a heavy downpore.  Does anyone know how the kangaroo got there  <br/>
or if they are missing their kangaroo. Any info would be greatly appreciated. <br/>
 I'll be happy to exchange the kangaroo for my stamp.<br/>

</span></blockquote>this actually sounds like a geocacher happened upon the box, and as is <br/>
the geocaching tradition 'take something, leave something' -- they took <br/>
the stamp and left the kangaroo? we found a geocache by accident once <br/>
and there were a couple beanie babies in it.  is there a geocaching <br/>
messageboard somewhere you could inquire?  A surprising greeting (a <br/>
kangaroo) from a letterbox!<br/>
