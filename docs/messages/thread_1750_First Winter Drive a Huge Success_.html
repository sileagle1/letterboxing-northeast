<br/>
<br/>
We're all thawed out by now and would like to invite you to visit our<br/>
website for some commentary and pictures of the First Winter Boxing Drive.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the cold temperatures, the group boxed from 9am to about 5pm<br/>
and then relaxed and exchanged over pizza and drinks. <br/>
<br/>
Plans are currently underway for the second drive in this series to<br/>
take place towards the end of February.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
<br/>

thanks to all of the Winter Drive participants for welcoming us to CT! <br/>
Special thanks go to our chauffeurs, the McLean clan, especially for <br/>
putting up with an extra-large kid in the back seat all day! It was great <br/>
to meet everyone, and I was surprised to see how far past F700 I cruised <br/>
during the day after tallying up all the finds and personal travellers.<br/>
<br/>
One question -- since all I did was ride in a car all day, how come I was <br/>
so tired when I got home? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to Chrissy and the Pepes for their work in putting the day <br/>
together!<br/>
<br/>
Doug<br/>

Thanks to Mark and Sue for the much needed hot chocolate, alot of good direction and their ever-awesome website recapping the day, to Music Woman for opening her home to us and all the goodies, to Chrissy for organizing this great event, and to ALL the boxers who made the day a complete success!  I enjoyed every minute.  MayEve<br/>
