weekend and camp in the area (Woodstock) the night before the <br/>
gathering. We will spend the day Saturday boxing and setting up camp. <br/>
We are especially interested in doing the Thompson Train Wreck <br/>
series. Anyone planning on some extended boxing time that weekend? We <br/>
have not had a chance to box in the Northeast section of the state <br/>
yet! Hope to see some boxers on the trail!<br/>
                                    Safe trails, <br/>
