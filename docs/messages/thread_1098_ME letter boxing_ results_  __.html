boxes. We fairly good results.<br/>
<br/>
Birthday Cliff walk, Prouts Neck, We found both boxes there and in <br/>
good shape.<br/>
<br/>
The Caged Bear, Saco Me, No luck finding the bear, we did find the <br/>
second stamp in the area, El Rey<br/>
<br/>
Fiddlehead Box, Saco me, No luck at all, they were working on one of <br/>
the boardwalks. But we had very little luck matching the clues to the <br/>
trail map, or to the trails themselves by walking around:(<br/>
<br/>
April Showers,<br/>
Porcupine Den, <br/>
Spring peeper,all in Alfred<br/>
Found them all in good shape. Porcupine den was a little tricky but <br/>
the clues helped once you saw the right large rock next to the trail, <br/>
then the clues all fell in place. Took a few trys that day but we got <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Nubble light and the Mouser, York me<br/>
Wasn't there, but this box was posted missing right after i left for <br/>
ME.<br/>
<br/>
Was a great Vacation<br/>
