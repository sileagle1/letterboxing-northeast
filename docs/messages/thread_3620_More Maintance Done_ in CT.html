on and are like new :-)<br/>
Hans- New log book and better container (THANKS Jonah's Whalers)<br/>
Don't Forget These - In good shape<br/>
I Wish You.... replaced missing ones<br/>
Melanie - new log book &amp; better container<br/>
I can't walk to Nature of the Forest (Part 2) or My Grandchildren yet <br/>
so if anyone can up date their condition for me - that would be very <br/>
helpful.<br/>
Safe &amp; Happy Trails<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1609381381">Nature of the Forest in People's State was our very first multi-box adventure! We found all 6 in Parts 1 and 2 but the Frog. The clues were excellent, and I am fairly confident Suzanne and I poked and prodded under the correct ledge (as well as a few others nearby just in case!) unsuccessfully twice each! We did find 2 real, live wood frogs while looking for it, though! As I recall, all of the other boxes were in good shape, but this was 2 months ago. I had posted to the group re: the Frog at the time, but they were met with silence. Anyone else out there seen the Frog in People's State Forest?<br/>
<br/>
Again, this is stretching my memory, but I don't recall any prior stampers remarking it missing. I believe we were the first to find it since the fall of 2006, but don't quote me on it! If it turns out to be active, please contact us! It's a nice place to visit even without the boxes!<br/>
