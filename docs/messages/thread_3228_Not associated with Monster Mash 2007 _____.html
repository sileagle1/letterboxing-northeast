I am sorry to send this out to both lists but I wanted to make<br/>
sure it went to everyone. I am thinking of having a Monster Mash<br/>
in 2007 if there is enough interest. I am going to do it a<br/>
little different then the last time. Here is what I want to do.<br/>
<br/>
1. Only ONE letterbox per person will be allowed this time.There<br/>
is a limit of the first 75 letterboxes.<br/>
2. The only way that the letterboxes will be returned is if<br/>
return postage is sent with the letterbox.<br/>
3. All letterboxes must be railroad themed. Because you will<br/>
find out way later if there is enough interest.<br/>
4. I NEED LOCAL HELP WITH THE GATHERING IN OCT .<br/>

<br/>
First I want to apologize for using the name Mansfield Monster<br/>
Mash of 2004. It was just easier to use that name to see if<br/>
there was any interest at all of having an event like that<br/>
again. I would like to think that I am creative a little bit any<br/>
way. I tried to take the easy way out and got burned. I am so<br/>
sorry.Take care.<br/>
<br/>
