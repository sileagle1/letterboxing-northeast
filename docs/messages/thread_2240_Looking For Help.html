Maine.<br/>
We will be traveling to Bar Harbor on vacation this weekend.<br/>
I am looking for a place to stretch our legs/walk the dog and just <br/>
generally get out of the car for awhile.<br/>
We are looking for a picnic lunch spot also.<br/>
We will be traveling Interstate 95N or possibly Route 1.<br/>
Any help at all with this will be GREATLY appreciated.<br/>
If there "happens" to be a letterbox there I certainly wouldn't object.<br/>
Thanks for any and all help.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-882106381">there is a really nice rest area on 95n between kittery and york. no<br/>
playground there but plenty of running room and picnic tables and a dog area<br/>
 it also has a letterbox hidden there. york has a number of letterboxes all<br/>
that are within 10 minutes or so of 95n. there is a playground in york beach<br/>
but i would not recommend it this time of year. would be way too hard to<br/>
find a parking place. hope this helps. <br/>
