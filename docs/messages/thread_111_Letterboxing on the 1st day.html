to visit HOP BROOK LAKE in Middlebury, CT. U.S. Presidents series #1 <br/>
&amp; #2 are both in good condition. Aside from finding more than a few <br/>
of them to be uncovered or in plain sight, it was nothing a little <br/>
creative re-hiding couldn't fix. I also added a few new baggies where <br/>
needed. Aaron's birthday box is a different story. The logbook was <br/>
soaked, and the moisture is causing the metal rings to rust and <br/>
corrode the book. I've witnessed first-hand what this can result in <br/>
if left unchecked.(i.e., a completely destroyed book)If someone can <br/>
get out there to retrieve the book soon, all it needs is a week of <br/>
drying to save it. I searched and searched for "MY HEART" but was not <br/>
able to locate this box. Was I looking in the wrong area? I hope so. <br/>
Perhaps someone can make it out there to check on it soon and let me <br/>
know. "RED SKY AT NIGHT" is in good condition. Neat logbook, RUBADUC! <br/>
Lastly, I traveled down the road to NAUGATUCK where I set off to <br/>
find "CEMETARY SEARCH 1" at the suggestion of a fellow letterboxer. <br/>
The box was in good condition, and I got a H.H.! Add that to the <br/>
other H.H. I found earlier in the day, and my box total for the <br/>
day=15! Just 15 more boxes to my 1st 100! Hmmm....where to next?  --<br/>

(Camera Obscura) in Boston so we decided to drive to Wrenthem, MA and<br/>
visit his aunt and box there. We found three boxes, all placed by Jay<br/>
&amp; Amy: Happy Turtle, Blueberry Confusion, and the Jay &amp; Amy letterbox.<br/>
Nice walking, great company and a few boxes closer to F50, which I<br/>
should hit this weekend. Yay!<br/>
<br/>
On the way down to Boston on New Year's Eve I found the Royal River<br/>
letterbox in Yarmouth. Great stamp! It's just beautiful!<br/>
<br/>
All the boxes I visited were in great shape. It was a very fun way to<br/>
start the new year.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing! Happy New Year!<br/>

NeeDeeps and we went up into the hills of Boston<br/>
Hollow in Ashford CT looking for Paige's Tales. It was<br/>
a successful day. Tough boxes but all were found.<br/>
Beautiful country to hike in. Great letterboxing<br/>
day.....Chuck and Molly.<br/>
