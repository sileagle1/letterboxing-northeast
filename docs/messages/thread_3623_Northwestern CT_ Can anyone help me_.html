Feel free to reply directly to <a href="mailto:dthreedvm01@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dthreedvm01@...</a> rather than through the grouplist if you like. Anyone else wanting to meet the LB force known as Jonah and join us in this mission is more than welcome! Just let me know, and we can set it up!<br/>
