 We are vacationing in Provincetown during the week of Columbus Day, <br/>
Oct 12. We really enjoy the walking/hiking/outdoors experience of <br/>
letterboxing, in addition to the wonderful stamps, we eventually <br/>
find. We will be letterboxing between Providence RI and Provincetown <br/>
MA.  Any suggestions on boxes, where we will enjoy the <br/>
view/walk/forest/beach, while reading to each other from a clue sheet <br/>
and walking right by the boxes *again*  :) , feel free to email me ( <br/>
unless you want to share with the group, also )<br/>
Thanks everyone,<br/>

Provincetown it rained.  This made getting "together since" a really <br/>
great find.  I was nervous about looking in a lobby but found it a <br/>
lot of fun.  The place was quiet and comfortable.  I loved sitting <br/>
on a comfy chair while looking at the log book and stamping in.  <br/>

The location is great, but best of all the writing in the log there is <br/>
fascinating.  Look for it.<br/>
