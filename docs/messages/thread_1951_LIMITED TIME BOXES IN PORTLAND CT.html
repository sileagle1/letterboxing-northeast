                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1495989435">Hey Folks! The Girl Scouts in CT have been busy preparing boxes! We had 7 troops from the central CT area create boxes and submit them. Mr. Safety and I hid them all and wrote the clues. Today we had a gathering for the scouts to find them all. <br/>
<br/>
Now its YOUR TURN!<br/>
<br/>
They are only in place through the end of May, then all boxes will be returned to the troops so they can see who has been there before the year ends!<br/>
<br/>
So...GET OUT THERE AND BOX!<br/>
<br/>
Clues to Letterboxes for the Girl Scout Gathering<br/>
<br/>
Directions to the Portland Riverfront Park:<br/>
<br/>
From Route 9 in Middletown:<br/>
<br/>
Take Exit 16 and follow Route 17N/66W over the river on the Arrigoni Bridge. <br/>
<br/>
Take your first left onto Silver Street (Hess Gas Station on the corner). Then follow below.<br/>
<br/>
From Route 66W:<br/>
<br/>
Follow Route 66 into Portland. At traffic light at Brooks Pharmacy turn left onto Main Street and then take your first right onto Silver Street at the Hess Gas Station. Then follow below.<br/>
<br/>
From all Points.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of Silver Street, merge right onto Brownstone Avenue (You will see lots of oil tanks along the river, it's not pretty, but its safe and you are in the right place).<br/>
<br/>
Follow Brownstone Avenue to the end of the road and park in the parking area near the park sign (limited space so carpool if possible). <br/>
<br/>
Follow the signs into the park and sign in at the table.<br/>
<br/>
MAPS: For those coming on their own I am going to put some trail maps in the Map Box on the Park Sign. Please be kind and replace them when done. They disappear quickly with local folks doing all sorts of mischief! If, by chance, there are no maps, it is possible to do these boxes. Just pay close attention when you walk in and you'll find all the trails as you walk out.<br/>
<br/>
Once you get to the park, go around the gate at the end of the road, this is the Main Trail, which is actually wide and open enough to drive on, but DON'T try it! Stop at the large rock on your right and enjoy the view of the quarries. You'll see an entrance to a smaller quarry that is still in operation today on the right also. Follow the Main Trail as it bends to the left and then again to the right. Follow all the way to the end at the Overlook over the CT River. Here the Main Trail bends to the right, but this is as far as you will go. Imagine that the Main Trail is a Main Street, with many smaller side streets going off on either direction. While walking in notice the side trails going off on either side so you can get your bearings when finding clues. After enjoying the view, begin following clues. I have arranged them in sequence for you to find on your way back to the Main Entrance, which would be the quickest and most efficient way to find them.<br/>
<br/>
REMINDERS: this area has been abused and neglected for a very long time, it is rather rustic looking and with little greenery this season, its not very pretty yet! However, neighborhood folks have become accustomed to coming down here and partying, so PLEASE re-hide boxes carefully! We had to build many of these hiding spots ourselves and make them look like they blend in! Try very hard to study the way they were hidden so you can re-create it when done. Walk around after hiding and check them from all angles to be sure they are not visible. Thanks in advance!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And now to the CLUES!<br/>
<br/>
Troop 2026<br/>
<br/>
From the Main Trail:<br/>
<br/>
On the Main Trail walk all the way to the Overlook and enjoy the view ( you'll be at a very large brownstone rock looking out over the river towards Cromwell. Once you are done, turn around and take 17 paces back from where you came. Looking right towards the river notice a rather large rock that looks like it has a step built into it. Walk around it on the right and look for a pile of rocks on your right. Lift the small flat one to find your prize! Re-bag everything and snap lid tightly! Retrace your steps back to the Main Trail.<br/>

The Brownie Try-It letterbox<br/>
<br/>
By Brownie Troop 2647<br/>
<br/>
From the Main Trail:<br/>
<br/>
Take the Great Cherry Trail (#8) on the trail map. It will be on you left as you begin your journey back toward the entrance. There is no trail sign, but it is quite obvious from the description. This trail has a steep but brief incline. There are two ways to get up it; go straight ahead and just climb or go around to the right and take the makeshift "steps". But either way be careful, it's been wet and muddy an rocks may be loose! (The kids will probably have no trouble with this, it's the adults I'm worried about!) Continue on the trail as it bends and curves. Eventually you will come to a Y, at the junction there will be a skinny tree that looks like its been tied in a knot at the middle, go right (which will feel like a sharp right turn). You'll then come to another Y, again stay right, you will be heading 140 degrees or SE away from the river. Step over a fallen log across the path and take 3 steps. Look for a pile of moss covered rocks on your right (gotta read Anansi and the Moss Covered Rock by Eric Kimmel!). Gently lift the thin flat rock to find your prize! Stamp in and re-hide carefully, be sure to re-bag everything well and snap lids on tightly! Retrace your steps back to the main trail.<br/>

Levels in Girl Scouting<br/>
<br/>
By Daisy/Brownie Troop 2050 <br/>
<br/>
From the Main Trail:<br/>
<br/>
Take the Great Cottonwood Trail (#7). Another left hand trail, this one IS marked with a trail sign on a tree, but you have to actually go into the trail to see it. Follow the trail until it dead ends at the Chip Trail. Turn around and walk back 6 paces (a pace is every other step) to a large flat triangular shaped rock in the path on the left in front of a twin sister tree. We placed a little rock on the corner you should lift, if it's not there, it's the corner pointing away from the trail. Your box is hiding in a hole under the rock. (FYI.We DID NOT dig that hole! That would be awful!)Stamp in and re-hide carefully, be sure to re-bag everything well and snap lids on tightly! Retrace your steps back to the main trail.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Troop 1107<br/>
<br/>
Junior Troop <br/>
<br/>
From the Main Trail:<br/>
<br/>
Take the Big Pine Trail and follow it until you reach Big Pine. This trail on the left is marked, but again, you'll have to actually go into the trail to see the sign. Stand on the big root with your back to the tree looking across the fire ring to the tree standing at the left corner of a large rock. The Troop 1107 box is hidden under that corner, but please go around the right to the backside of the rock to dig it out. Here it is essential that you check the box from all angles to be sure it isn't visible after re-hiding! Re-bag everything and snap lid tightly! Re-trace your steps back to the Main Trail.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Junior Dur Traveling Turtle<br/>
<br/>
Junior Troop 3035 <br/>
<br/>
From the Main Trail:<br/>
<br/>
Take the Chip Path/Chip Trail (Map says one, trail sign says the other, oops!) (large wide open trail on left, it does have a trail sign). Keep a watch out for the Autumn Olive .a square silver sign depicting the tree species.on your left. From the Autumn Olive take 10-12 paces (a pace is every other step) further. Turn onto the Goats Path on the right. Follow the trail a short distance. Just before it begins to climb the rock facing you'll see a large moss covered rock (read Anansi and the Moss Covered Rock by Eric Kimmel!) to the right of the trail. Look below its highest point to find dur Turtle! Re-bag everything and snap lid tightly! Retrace your steps back to the Main Trail.<br/>
<br/>
Mission Possible<br/>
<br/>
By Brownie Troop 3244 <br/>
<br/>
From the Main Trail:<br/>
<br/>
Head back towards the Entrance. You'll come to a trail leading off to the right with a sign that says "TRAIL" on a tree. It will be just before the Main Trail bends off to the left. Follow the trail towards the river. When you get to the fire ring, go straight across it towards the river. Go down the small hill to a gully and stop, do not go up the other side. Take a reading of 210 degrees and look for a rock hiding place under a bush. Mission Possible is hiding here...this is a VERY ACTIVE area... please stamp in and re-hide carefully, be sure to re-bag everything well and snap lids on tightly! Retrace your steps back to the Main Trail.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Flowers<br/>
<br/>
From the Main Trail:<br/>
<br/>
When you came into the park you passed by a very large and high brownstone wall, evidence that this whole area has grown out of the discarded brownstone from the quarry. Go to the wall and locate the one tree growing in front of it. The Flowers Letterbox is hidden in the wall to the left of the tree about 2 feet up. This area sees a lot of traffic! Please be sure the box is not visible when you re-hide it! Re-bag everything and snap lid tightly! Re-trace your steps back to the Parking area. <br/>
<br/>
We hope you had fun!<br/>
<br/>
