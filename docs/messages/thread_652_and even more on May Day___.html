gathering last Sunday. It made a wonderful final stop after two <br/>
weeks on the road (hopefully big sitrep to come on that when I can  <br/>
get used to NOT being on vacation anymore!).<br/>
<br/>
We regret having to leave fairly early on in the festivities in <br/>
order to get home and settle down/unpack. TeamGreenDragon tells us <br/>
that we actually won something in the raffle and that it will only <br/>
cost us $50 to get it from them... ;)<br/>
<br/>
As always, it was great seeing old faces and meeting seveal new <br/>
(including *finally* meeting the Lion and the Sand Dollar (now AM &amp; <br/>
PM, whom I realized only after getting home that we've been seeing <br/>
their stamp in logbooks for a loong time...good luck with the kiddo, <br/>
guys! What do you get anyways when you cross a lion and a sand <br/>
dollar...?)<br/>

I believe when you won the walking stick, I was jumping up and down saying "We Won, We Won..."  So I think one of those sticks is mine.  <br/>
