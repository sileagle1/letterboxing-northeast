MUST DO!!  Although the preserve was very wet today, it was still do-<br/>
able.  The stamps are wonderful for all those Pooh fans out there, <br/>
like me!!! The 3 box Indian Series in the same preserve is also well <br/>
done and very easy to do at the same time.  Several of the boxes were <br/>
not too well hidden, so as we all box after winter snow and ice are <br/>
FINALLY GONE, we need to replace leaves and sticks that were not <br/>
available from under the snow.  The ToadDog is definitely happy to be <br/>
back out on the trail.  Two weeks ago we did two of Bluebird's series <br/>
in Madison, Dirt Paths and The Animals of Rockland Preserve.  All <br/>
boxes were found, but the trudging through the wet snow made me wish <br/>
I had snowshoes!!!  Happy Boxing,Everyone!-Sunshine, Swamp Yankee and <br/>
the ToadDog :0)P.S. A BIG Congrats to Hez, Grumpy and the Mona Dog <br/>
for finding 500 YAYAYAYAY  We look forward to helping you reach <br/>
1000.</div>
