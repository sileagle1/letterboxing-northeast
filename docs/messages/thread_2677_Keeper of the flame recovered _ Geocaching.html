I am SO DELIGHTED for you! To have something go missing is sad, but <br/>
to have it suddenly reappear is PRICELESS!<br/>
<br/>
I know that sometimes geocachers get a bad rap, but I have a <br/>
letterbox in RI that is only a few degrees away from the GPS of a <br/>
geocache. The owner of the geocache and I take turns doing <br/>
maintenance on each others treasures!<br/>
<br/>
I'm doing the happy dance for ya!<br/>

<br/>
  The New England Geocachers seem to be a great bunch.  Two of them allowed me to place logbooks in their caches, for letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
  Turned out I had some Geocaching waypoints near at least 3 of my boxes (these waypoints were white plastic rings with coordinates).  I adopted the cache, so no problem coordinating maintianance for me either.<br/>
<br/>
  I don't like to drive in the winter, so I have been doing nearby Geocaches since 12/27/05.  No GPSr is required; at the cache listing, click on "topozone" and write your own letterbox-style clues.  Done that way, they are harder than most letterboxes.  <br/>
<br/>
  enjoy the hunt!<br/>
