the Gallery at Casco Bay Letterbox!  I was there this past weekend <br/>
and WOW! That's all I'm going to say because I don't want to spoil <br/>
anything for anyone.  <br/>
While you are there check out the employee art show that is not only <br/>
in the gallery but, also, all over the shop.  Fabulous work!  Thanks <br/>
