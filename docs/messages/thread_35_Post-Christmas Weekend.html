Of course, I have to work on the 26th (and I'm <br/>
hosting dinner for roughly 20 of my nearest <br/>
relatives) but Saturday would work for me.<br/>
<br/>
Where are you planning on staying Phyto? Perhaps we<br/>
could get a troop together for some good ole fashion<br/>
boxing in the snow (or hopefully lack thereof)<br/>
<br/>
Also, I happen to have the 2nd of January off from<br/>
work and would possibly be open to travelling to the<br/>
great state of Maine to start the New Year with<br/>
some wonderful boxing adventure (or downhill skiing).<br/>

<br/>
The weekend after the 25th is lovely <br/>
The new years weekend 2nd-4th is also dandy<br/>
<br/>
All in all, it would be grand to travel and get together!<br/>
I sense some boxing fever coming on - quick get the thermometer :-)</div>

or 27th in CT. We may very well be in either Fairfield or Glastonbury,<br/>
CT (although we might not be at either and might end up in NY instead<br/>
- who knows - it's still up in the air exactly who we're going to<br/>
visit after Christmas).<br/>
I'm not a huge cold weather fan, but perhaps the letterboxing fever<br/>
that Phyto has managed to pass on to me will keep me warm for my first<br/>
winter letterboxing season. We both own cross country skiis and<br/>
snowshoes - as long as I'm moving to keep warm I'm generally OK and<br/>
not too much of a wuss :) <br/>
I'm curious to see how the more experienced letterboxers deal with<br/>
finding boxes in the snow and covering their tracks afterwards. I also<br/>
wouldn't be averse to a carving lesson from some of the more talented<br/>
amongst you (I know TGD and DrewClan are great having seen a few of<br/>
their stamps first hand and know there must be others out there with a<br/>
knack for it as well) Besides, that's a great excuse to go inside for<br/>
a bit, warm up those frost bitten fingers and indulge in a cup of<br/>
steaming hot cocoa (mmmm... with chambord and godiva liquor added it's<br/>
even better! I can taste it now)<br/>
