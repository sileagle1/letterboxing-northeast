                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1715706871">OK, I was catching up on my reading in Cook's Illustrated (Sept./Oct. 2005), and they had a rating of food storage bags.  I thought this might be useful since we use bags for our letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
WVTR: Water vapor transmission rate: grams per meters squared per day, which is the rate at which moisture passes through the plastic film.  THE LOWER THE NUMBER, THE BETTER.<br/>
<br/>
DURABILITY: Bags three-quarters full of spaghetti sauce were dropped from a height of 3 feet onto a plastic tarp.  Bags that survived two drops were rated good.<br/>
<br/>
The recommended food storage bags are:<br/>
<br/>
Glad Freezer Zipper Bags: WVTR was 7.14<br/>
Second thickest bag tested, has airtight double-groove seal, which held fast even through two rounds of the spaghetti-sauce drop test (sounds tough enough to withstand New England winters and spring thaw).  <br/>
<br/>
Ziploc Freezer Bags: WVTR was 7.79<br/>
Sturdy, slick and airtight.  Single-groove seal was not quite sturdy enough to withstand stress test.  Has a wide opening however!<br/>
<br/>
Hefty OneZip Storage Bags: WVTR was 10.14<br/>
Usually performed as well or better than the thicker freezer bags and slider seal was watertight (very promising for keeping logbooks dry).  However, water vapor transmission rate (they used bread storage.  It took about 12 days for water to penetrate), was not as promising.<br/>
<br/>
Ziplock storage bags: WVTR was 11.35<br/>
Classic zipper design with an airtight seal, which helped it perform remarkably well, especially given the thin film it's made of.  The flimsy gauge made ladling sauce into this bag a chore.<br/>
<br/>
It was a really interesting article to read.  It sounds like the Glad Freezer Zipper Bags are definitely the best!If you can, pick up a copy and see how the others rated!<br/>
