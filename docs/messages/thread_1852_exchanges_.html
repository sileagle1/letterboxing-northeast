<br/>
I went through her book this morning and, can you believe she got exchanges that I DIDN'T get!!!!!??? Geez! If only they were on plain white acid-free paper, I'd cut and paste, but I just can't do that to my book! AArgh!<br/>
<br/>
We missed some people entirely...but Bluebird and flutterby both got in M &amp; M's book!<br/>
<br/>
Well, perhaps another time!<br/>
