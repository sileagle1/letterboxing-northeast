following boxes:<br/>
Ship to Neverland<br/>
Fallen Stars<br/>
You Otter See This<br/>
<br/>
(it also may be in Bluebird's car)<br/>
I remember stamping into Ship to Neverland, and then we headed out to Fallen <br/>
Stars and You Otter See This.  I had the logbook in my pocket, but didn't need <br/>
it for FS and YOST, so if I lost it there, it fell out of my pocket.  If <br/>
anyone is going to Windham, please let me know if you find my logbook.  Hope the <br/>
rain doesn't ruin it!  I was just going to start a new one!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
