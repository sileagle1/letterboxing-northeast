                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1392729794">We'll be out east later this month and would be interested in recommendations anyone might have for Maine and New Hampshire. We prefer longer, more rigorous hikes and enjoy finding some boxes along the way.<br/>
<br/>
We'll be flying in/out of Portland and only have 1 week out there. We will definitely spend time in the southern part of the states due to some LB events. We probably won't go too much further northeast of Portland, but are looking at hikes in the White Mountains.<br/>
<br/>
Please post to the board or send a private message if you have some recommedations for good letterboxing hikes.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

It's called Pentagrams set II and it's in Randolph NH.<br/>
<br/>
It goes up Mt. Randolph and beyond. Was almost too rigorous for me, but I don't hike much. Took me about 5 hours. <br/>
<br/>
I really liked the clues. You don't need a trail map because everything is extremely well marked.<br/>
