&gt; &gt; Prayer Rock was carved and planted by The Vermont Viking, one of<br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; founders of LbNA. The boxing community lost Eric to cancer several <br/>
&gt; &gt; years ago, but his wife Susan has continued to be an inspiration<br/>
and a <br/>
&gt; &gt; resource to letterboxers ever since.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Sue did replace the old logbook this year, so the log is<br/>
preserved in <br/>
&gt; &gt; her home. But she is worried that the original stamp is likely<br/>
missing. <br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm sure that she would welcome any offers from talented carvers to <br/>
&gt; &gt; replace the stamp. Any one have the time?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Sorry to bear this sad news, Jay in CT<br/>
