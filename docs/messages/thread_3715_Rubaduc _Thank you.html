one of the raffle baskets, but couldn't quite fit into the kid sized <br/>
Cootie Crew t-shirt, so she kindly gave it to my youngest son, Timbo, <br/>
along with 2 cootie crew patches for Timbo and his brother!<br/>

They were quite gratified, and I am sorry to say that they earned the <br/>
slogan at the gathering, as well....<br/>

Rubaduc is a gem in the letterboxing world. I don't plant anymore but <br/>
if I did I would make a "Queen of Misfit Letterboxes" stamp just for <br/>
her.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the great places you have taken me, and I officially <br/>
apologize for all the great names I have called you will toiling up <br/>
those hills. <br/>
