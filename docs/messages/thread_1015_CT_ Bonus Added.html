my "Of All the Things I've Lost" series in Clinton. It got misplaced <br/>
under his saw when he made the backing for it! Fish-or-Man <br/>
helped me add it in as a bonus today - heads up to those of you <br/>
who have already done been to Peter's Woods.<br/>
This is just more of the fun Hiker Lou and I have had on local <br/>
trails this week.</div>
