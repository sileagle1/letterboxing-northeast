                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2004981920">On Friday, Moonbeam and I ventured out to Gillette Castle to have <br/>
lunch along the CT. river. Afterwards, with our bellies full, it was <br/>
off to pick up a few boxes. First we visited "Cove Cemetery"(cool <br/>
stamp!) then off to "Sherlock's Home" ***Both boxes have full <br/>
logbooks and dried-out inkpads!---also, box#1 needs a new <br/>
container*** Being that I was with no supplies, I could not provide <br/>
the needed repairs.(sorry!) Then, the "African Queen"(good condition) <br/>
and "The Grinch in CT" (another cool stamp S&amp;R!) We followed those up <br/>
with "Flower Drum Song" on the way home.(logbooks are just about full <br/>
also!) Then it was back to the house for a quick rest before setting <br/>
out on my own to Sleeping Giant to grab the "Tower" box(M&amp;M's) for my <br/>
last find of the day. Thanks for all the cool boxes guys!!   --<br/>
