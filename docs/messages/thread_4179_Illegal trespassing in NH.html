I am writing you regarding a disturbing trend whereby various Geocachers have <br/>
been trespassing private property in their zeal to find their clues including my <br/>
land which is in Bradford NH. My surveillance cameras caught two Geocachers on <br/>
Sept. 26, with GPS devices, hatchet, book and cellphones on their belt, breaking <br/>
through my barriers by a bridge and trespassing my property with blatant <br/>
disregard for the POSTED and NO TRESPASSING SIGNS clearly marked and on display <br/>
like Christmas lights.�<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if they were from your organization but so far Geocache.com had <br/>
denied it although they admitted that one of their caches was within a couple <br/>
hundred feet. The local police thinks it was one of theirs but a Geocache <br/>
official is strongly denying it and has recommended that I look into several <br/>
other Geocache organizations. If you know of any caches that are on West Meadow <br/>
road in Bradford, please let me know and you should also immediately delete any <br/>
coordinates that are toward the south end of that road. The trespassers not only <br/>
committed criminal trespass, they also chopped down part of a small tree to <br/>
notch an obvious sign for future geocachers but proceeded to wander more than <br/>
200' into my land and were there at least a half hour making mocking gestures to <br/>
my camera as they left.<br/>
<br/>
I am not saying these people were from your Opencaching organization but I do <br/>
want to know if you have any caches in that area of Bradford NH? Additionally, <br/>
you could be of help by clearly stating that your organization strictly <br/>
prohibits the trespass of any private property marked with POSTED or NO <br/>
TRESPASSING signs regardless of whether they think there is a cache there or <br/>
not.�<br/>
<br/>
Thanks very much,<br/>

I'll hold my tongue on my true feelings on cachers on this one. It's just upsetting that the distructive nature of caching in general puts a black mark of shame on other hobbies that hunt tupperware in the woods.<br/>
