<br/>
  Looks as if I will miss hugs from the pups tomorrow .  Donna really wants to get the box of the month  and my promise to go with her when ever she had time . still sticks. <br/>
  Any chance you would be able to hold off planting more in Old Lyme till next week ???I would love to go with you into that little land trust  and hope perhaps you would have time to also check out that other trail at Champlain north  area  ?  The white trail in Laurel Hill is also one to take a look see .  At Champlain South are a few more to investigate as well .  So many trail, so little time .<br/>
  Have a nice day <br/>
