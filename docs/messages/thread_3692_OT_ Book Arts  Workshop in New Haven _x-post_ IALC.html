many using Coptic Stitch to sew them together.I came across the<br/>
following  workshop in New Haven, CT that I thought some of you might<br/>
be interested in. <br/>
<br/>
On Sunday, February 3,from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., the Creative Arts<br/>
Workshop is hosting a class called "Coptic Sewing with Drum Boards" at<br/>
it's facility at 80 Audubon Street in New Haven. The cost for<br/>
non-members is $85. I signed up but do not know yet if there are any<br/>
additional charges for materials. The instructor will send additional<br/>
information after sign-up. Basic tools such as bone folder, scissors,<br/>
etc., are probably requried. <br/>
<br/>
Here is the course description: <br/>
"Coptic sewing is a chain-like stitch that is exposed on the spine of<br/>
a book. It is very versatile and can be used for journals, sketchbooks<br/>
and artists books. In this workshop, students will learn one type of<br/>
Coptic sewing. First we will practice by sewing signatures of a soft<br/>
cover exhibition catalogue. Then we will create a small hardcover<br/>
blank book, with drum board covers, which lies perfectly flat when<br/>
open. In addition, we will review other possibilities for these sewing<br/>
and board techniques, including their use in certain book repairs. A<br/>
list of tools and materials needed will be sent to students upon<br/>
registration. Previous handcraft experience is recommended.<br/>
Instructor: Susan Klein studied bookbinding at CAW and Center for Book<br/>
Arts in NY. She worked as a bookbinder in the Preservation Department<br/>
of Yale University Library for almost ten years, repairing books in<br/>
the circulating collections. She has also studied and taught weaving,<br/>
knitting, drawing, printmaking, and origami, and has exhibited at CAW<br/>
and other craft galleries in CT and NY. Cost: $85; members: $77"<br/>

Hope to see some boxer-bookmakers there! Might be a lovely way to<br/>
while away a cold winter Sunday and chase the doldrums away.<br/>

send the course catalogue to you about four times a year. The classes<br/>
do fill up quickly.  We have taken many courses (and summer art camps)<br/>
there and they are always professional and courteous.  Check out their<br/>
exhibits sometime, a wonderful display of creativity.<br/>
