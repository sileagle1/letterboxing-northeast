                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1833253117">Hi all.  I am writing from sunny Florida, where I am visiting my parents<br/>
(and, of course, letterboxing--found two at Disney yesterday).  At this<br/>
point I'm not sure whether I can do dinner after the gathering, but it's a<br/>
nice idea. So, for the moment, put me down as a "maybe" on the dinner.<br/>
<br/>
Since I live on Route 9, can I skip the Pike and drive to the gathering<br/>
via Route 9? If that were quick, then maybe I could stay on for dinner. <br/>
Warrior Woman, would you recommend that?<br/>
<br/>
Gotta run--we are off to Cocoa Beach!<br/>

</span></blockquote>Yep, take Route 9 to 135 in Westborough.  Head toward Westborough <br/>
Center, go around the rotary and STAY ON ROUTE 135.  Harvey Farm is <br/>
on the left less than a mile away, parking entrance is on Maple <br/>
Street.<br/>
