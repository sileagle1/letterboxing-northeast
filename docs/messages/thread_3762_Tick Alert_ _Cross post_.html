As we all know, warm weather brings our lovely tick friends out to play. If<br/>
you are like me, though, this fact may not be foremost on your mind as you<br/>
set out for a hike. On this, the first day of Spring, I flicked TWELVE ticks<br/>
off my (fortunately light-colored) pants while I was out hiking. Granted, I<br/>
was hiking our newest trail, that is flagged but not yet built (and<br/>
therefore lots of bushwhacking), but it was truly a wake-up call! Just<br/>
thought I'd send out a little reminder.<br/>

<br/>
My son got Lymes Disease summer before last.  We had a hard time  <br/>
protecting him from insects because he has very sensitive skin, and  <br/>
even reacted to the natrapel and other "gentle" pesticide  <br/>
treatments.  Finally I found Buzz-Off clothing, which uses a  <br/>
synthetic version of something in chrysanthamums to repell insects.   <br/>
My son and I wear our "letterboxing clothes" every time we go out,  <br/>
and never get bitten my mosquitos or followed home by ticks.  My  <br/>
husband thought the clothing was silly, until the day we all went out  <br/>
(him wearing his major DDT containing substance) - he got bitten and  <br/>
we didn't.  It's a great relief not to worry about the ticks any more.<br/>
<br/>
Too bad they don't make socks for dogs!<br/>
