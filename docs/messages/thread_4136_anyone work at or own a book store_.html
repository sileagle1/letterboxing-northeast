have to tell them all about it !! they are always interested for sure , and it <br/>
can get to take a long time ~ but perhaps you could just use your own judgement <br/>
after finding the one that is there -- and plant yours .  If they are interested <br/>
and are boxers , they will see the clues once you put them on line anyway .!  <br/>
When you do come to town, be sure to hunt the other boxes in both the down town <br/>
and several of the out buildings at the Main Book  Barn.   You will love all <br/>
three places . <br/>

They know about the boxes, right? If I go to the childrens one with a <br/>
box to plant, and ask permission, we assume they will say its ok?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>

&gt; No, that is the main one , a real old barn with quite a few 'out' <br/>
&gt; buildings all<br/>
&gt; housing books in a farm setting complete with goats and friendly cats .<br/>
&gt; The Children one is right in town , just a few doors from the DownTown <br/>
&gt; Book<br/>
&gt; Barn , it is wonderful , a childs dream place . [ I love it !]<br/>

&gt; &gt; Subject: [LbNE] anyone work at or own a book store?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was wondering if anyone owns a book shop, works at one, or knows<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone that does? Preferably a book shop, but possibly a library? I<br/>
&gt; &gt; figure a fellow letterboxer would be more open to the idea :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Would like to plant a box at one somewhere in Eastern CT (or possibly<br/>
&gt; &gt; not too far into MA/RI) and am hoping to find a place that a letterbox<br/>
&gt; &gt; would be welcomed at. Otherwise, I may just stop by a local book store<br/>
&gt; &gt; to ask, explain letterboxing and hope they are not hesitant to allow it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>
