Both boxes are mystery boxes in the commonwealth of MA.  Before we <br/>
post the clues, however, we're going to verify that the written <br/>
clues are accurate enough to get hunters to the boxes.<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if someone other than us was willing to verify <br/>
them as well.<br/>
<br/>
What do other placers do?  I have no friends nearby that are <br/>
letterboxers ... and no one really that I can think of to use other <br/>
than asking other letterboxers to hunt them.  Of course, if someone <br/>
acts as a "beta tester", they'd have to be privy to the starting <br/>
location of the clues.<br/>
