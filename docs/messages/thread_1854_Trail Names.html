for a while.....though our little clan is growing so fast we're gonna <br/>
have to consider going to an actual group trail name!  Of course that <br/>
means I'd have to recarve our family stamp ONCE AGAIN which is <br/>
certainly a daunting task. My the dilemma's we face...and *I* thought <br/>
compass work was difficult! <br/>
<br/>
We were considering taking Patrick and Amy's abbreviation idea but <br/>
that would result in "Shhh" and we don't want anyone thinking we're <br/>
trying to silence the opinions of fellow 'boxers! <br/>

-Steve in snowy syracuse....no wait....we're still in CT, it just <br/>
feels like Syracuse!</div>
