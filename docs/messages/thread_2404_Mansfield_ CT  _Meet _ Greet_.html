                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-679424435">Beedle from Maine, phynstar from NY and sojourner from CT will be <br/>
spending Columbus Day weekend letterboxing in the Mansfield area.  <br/>
This will be Beedle's first experience with CT 'boxing, and what <br/>
better introduction than in Mansfield!!<br/>
<br/>
If you're planning on being in that area on Sunday, October 9, bring <br/>
your lunch and join us for a short "Meet &amp; Greet" at Mansfield <br/>
Hollow State Park!<br/>
<br/>
It's not a gathering, just a low-key, no-frills opportunity to chat, <br/>
eat lunch together while getting some exchanges, and enjoy the early <br/>
fall weather.<br/>
<br/>
WHERE:  Mansfield Hollow State Park picnic grove, Bassetts Bridge <br/>
Road, Mansfield, CT.  (Off Route 195)<br/>
WHEN:  Sunday, October 9th<br/>
TIME:  12:00 to 1:00pm<br/>
<br/>
From the entrance, drive as far as you can go, past the ball field <br/>
on the right and the 2 wooden outhouses, to the picnic grove.  You <br/>
won't miss us - we'll have a bright orange tablecloth on our picnic <br/>
table!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there!<br/>
