Antiboxer2 and I have vacationed there for many years and take advantage of all the wonderful hikes, spectacular views and fresh clean air!  This is the first time that we have letterboxed there and here is the status of the boxes that we visited.<br/>
<br/>
Cathedral Ledges Series - everything in great shape here<br/>
Eastern Slopes Inn Riverwalk - great shape<br/>
White Horse Ledge - Pete and Wanda haven't signed in yet?  : )  This isn't an easy hike  - great stamp, but would have been disappointed if it was missing.<br/>
Diana's Baths - great location! logbook full<br/>
Diana's Bath Too - great shape<br/>
Elephant Head - logbook full<br/>
Red Bench Letterbox - missing, but nice hike - saw bear scat<br/>
Fall Foliage - one of the most interesting stamps that I've come across letterboxing.  It was 2 separate stamps.  One was a tree and the other was the leaves and you overlay the stamps when stamping in. 2 colored ink pads - wonderful idea.<br/>
<br/>
Our last day, we were going to do more letterboxing, but Anti boxer2 decided he wanted to try hiking Mt. Washington that day.  We took the Tuckerman's trail to Lion's Head trail.  Wonderful day for hiking and a great end to our vacation!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who planted these boxes.  Filled in our vacation time quite nicely.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
