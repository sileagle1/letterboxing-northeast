and Creatures of Myth and Legend. When we got to Ant #10,  on top <br/>
of that box was a Troll Box. Both boxes were Soaking in water, with <br/>
much water inside. We dried as best we could, and contacted the Ant <br/>
planters, but I couldn't find a listing for the Troll box.  The log is <br/>
drenched and needs time to dry. We aren't near the area normally or I <br/>
would have brought it home to dry.  If anyone knows the planter of the <br/>
Troll box, please tell them it needs to come in to dry!  Thanks  <br/>
