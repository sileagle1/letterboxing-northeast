not listed there that group of boxers won't find your clues.<br/>
<br/>
Also, many people do not log their finds on AQ.  When you log on and check<br/>
your boxes on AQ you can look at how many hits the clue has gotten, that may<br/>
be an interesting number for you to look at as well.<br/>

I have a question for VT 'boxers: do most of you only do Valley Quest boxes?<br/>
Do any of you use AtlasQuest.com to find clues to 'regular' letterboxes? The<br/>
reason I ask is, we visited Woodstock, VT about 2 1/2 years ago (fell in<br/>
LOVE with it, BTW) and (IMHO) planted a nice 'box on a nice trail not too<br/>
far from downtown. To date, there has only been 1 find, according to our<br/>
AtlasQuest log information. We really expected for there to be a lot more<br/>
finders or at least word that the 'box was missing or something. It's called<br/>
"Woodstock in Woodstock".<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>
