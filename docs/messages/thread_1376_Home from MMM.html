Chuck and those who organized it did a fantastic job.  It was great to meet those people I had only met online.  You are even nicer in person.  (Brian doesn't bite in person).  You all made me feel so welcome at my first gathering.  Thank you.  Tomorrow I will count and see just how many boxes and exchanges we got.  By the way, what does the Monster Games stamp count as????  Is there a category for other?  <br/>
