<br/>
Jim Harvey closes the farm to the public on December 24.<br/>
<br/>
He has a few trips planned for January.  I am hoping<br/>
to nail him down for some weekend in January.  It<br/>
could possibly be in February, though.  I don't know<br/>
yet.  He's looking as his schedule.<br/>
<br/>
As noted in my previous post to the LBNE group, the only<br/>
sanitary facilities is one portolet.  For this event,<br/>
he'll need to arrange for the parking lot to be<br/>
plowed, a second portolet for the day, and I need to<br/>
find a few conference tables.<br/>
<br/>
Since his barn is actually a country gift barn, he<br/>
will have someone to come in to man the register if<br/>
anyone wishes to make purchases.  He has some really<br/>
cool stuff.  Trust me on this one.<br/>
<br/>
The space inside is rather crowded, so I am thinking<br/>
that we will have the food inside where it is warm,<br/>
and place the conference tables just outside the<br/>
door for stamp exchanges.<br/>
<br/>
There are a LOT of letterboxes in the nearby area, including the one <br/>
at the farm itself.  I will pull that letterbox out of its hiding <br/>
place for the event, since the place where it is hidden cannot <br/>
withstand the heavy traffic it would endure for an event.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has plans of placing "event only" boxes, please understand <br/>
that you will not be able to plant them on the farm itself, nor in <br/>
the barn.  The barn is filled with a lot of fragile items.  We want <br/>
to respect the space.  If you wish to do an "event only" box, please <br/>
have them on your person, like a traveler, or out in the open, on the <br/>
exchange table.  Or plant one in the many nearby forest and trail <br/>
areas.<br/>
<br/>
Brian of Team Green Dragon has already volunteered<br/>
to carve the Event stamp.<br/>
<br/>
(Thank you, Brian)<br/>
<br/>
I'll let you all know the date just as soon as *I* know<br/>
the date!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your patience.<br/>

gathering but am busy on Jan. 10 and 17...any Saturday after <br/>
that, or any Sunday in January will work for me. <br/>

But please help me out--I can't find a message that says where <br/>

</span></blockquote>Gracious ahem- I mean, Fierce (!) - Warrior Woman has taken it upon<br/>
herself to contact Jim - the owner of a farm in Westborough,<br/>
Massachusetts. There is not date or time that has been officially<br/>
established for this gathering as of yet.<br/>
<br/>
If you check the POE letterbox clue it ought to provide enough<br/>
information See ref:<br/>
