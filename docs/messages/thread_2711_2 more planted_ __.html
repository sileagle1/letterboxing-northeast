<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We went down to Walpole's Bird Park yesterday in hopes of finding 5 boxes.<br/>
Miss Emilie had other ideas, but we did find 3, including a gorgeous walk<br/>
across several bridges.   The other two will have to wait for our next trip.<br/>
Note to self:  late afternoon is when toddlers are tired, bad boxing time.<br/>
Duh!     Luckily, she fell asleep on the way home, so I got Historic Millis<br/>
#4 hidden, and then last night, carved "Shrubbery Surfing."    Being awake<br/>
at 6:30a and knowing that hubby wasn't leaving for another half hour, I<br/>
darted out the door and planted SS before Em woke up.    It's definitely<br/>
easier to plant and count paces, etc for clues when not with baby.<br/>
Hehehehe.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have loved some of the ideas on the list this week about hiding spots and<br/>
have a great new idea for a whole series .. just gotta figure out my<br/>
containers.  :-)<br/>
