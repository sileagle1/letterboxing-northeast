<br/>
I have been lbing lightly for a couple of years, but on Friday, I am planning to take<br/>
a friend out for the first time... she has a 9 and 6 year old, and so do I.<br/>
<br/>
Can any of you suggest a lighter series in West Hartford or closeby, that would be a good<br/>
intro to letterboxing for some kiddos?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any suggestions!<br/>

Fun clues, not too difficult hiding locations, nice carves. There are several other short series there, as well as some individual boxes with longer hikes.<br/>
