Army Reservists run a certain risk, and I got my marching orders.  Nothing very dramatic - I'm an instructor, so I'll be going around the East Coast for a year (or so) training battalion, brigade and division headquarters units in lovely locations like Fort Dix, NJ, Fort Drum, NY and Fort Bragg, NC.  On occasion, if I get two or more days idle, I can come home and visit Diane.  It's not what you'd call a hardship activation like so many others!<br/>
     So I'll be out of the loop for a bit.  Diane still has her ears on, and our boxes will still be maintained.  It's also possible I'll get some other active duty families involved in the hobby, too!  Military dependants like to keep occupied when Mom or Dad and I are off doing Army Stuff...<br/>

Auf Weidersehen!<br/>
