just a little apprehension.  Little did I know that there would be <br/>
so many open arms! I had an amazing time meeting new friends and <br/>
getting reacquainted with a few old. THANK YOU to Chuck, Molly, <br/>
Chickabirdie, Teach and Preach, The NeeDeeps and ALL the others who <br/>
made this gathering such a wonderfully memorable event. OK, now I'm <br/>
ready for the next!!   Blessings, MayEve</div>

<br/>
Now, I was wondering... how many people were there? We got 90 exchanges, including 10 Personal Travelers, but we realize that there were a lot more people than that..<br/>
<br/>
I hope to meet the rest of the group in the next gathering  :-)<br/>
