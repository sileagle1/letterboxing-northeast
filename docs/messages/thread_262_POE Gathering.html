Mapliners, Music Woman, Teach &amp; Preach, Phyto and everyone who made <br/>
me feel welcomed. I started the day without an exchange and by day's <br/>
end had made 56 new friends. Also thanks Warrior Woman for a great <br/>
place and gathering.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry I didn't make the Tweed's gathering after but I felt guilty <br/>
leaving my wife all day, so I headed home.  I should have stayed, I <br/>
came home to a empty house. My wife &amp; daughter went shopping for the <br/>
day and didn't get back till 8:00 pm.<br/>

    Diane and I had a GREAT time yesterday!  It was a real hoot to put faces to names and stamps!  I think we are lucky to have seen enough of the ames on the trail, first, then met y'all together - it gave us a kind of a context and a sense of shared experience already.<br/>
    But forget THAT - next time I'M going for the FOOD!  Incredible thank-yous to all who made this a great event!<br/>
