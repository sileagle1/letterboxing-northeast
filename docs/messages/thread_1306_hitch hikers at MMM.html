                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1383098931">Hi all,<br/>
  Just want to suggest that folks apply  common sense before <br/>
bringing a HH to a gathering -- if the logbook is likely to be <br/>
filled up by the gathering -- maybe it should be planted at the <br/>
gathering instead of put on a table.<br/>
<br/>
 Of course this suggestion reflects my personal bias. I have tried <br/>
to keep our HH packages/boxes small so they more easily fit into a <br/>
host box. This usually meant a small logbook.  I would like my HHs <br/>
to travel to several boxes before getting a full logbook. <br/>
<br/>
   For the Monster Mash I would also like to suggest (not dictate) <br/>
that folks consider putting the HH in one of the many boxes set out <br/>
for the event. That way lots of people can find them and perhaps the <br/>
log will collect not just several personal stamps, but several <br/>
stamps for the MM boxes as well -- that would be a treat for the <br/>
person who placed the HH!<br/>
<br/>
   Just my thoughts - ignore if they upset you!<br/>

<br/>
A couple years ago when only 40 people came to a gathering and it <br/>
could be discretely left out for others to happen upon, well, that <br/>
was fun! <br/>
<br/>
Nowadays there's over 100 people going to gatherings and you could <br/>
easily fill up a pack of note cards with one event. <br/>
<br/>
It's ultimately OK to bring them to gathering and I don't think we <br/>
should scare people off. Perhaps discretion is paramount? If a few <br/>
folks go out in a group to box together, bring it out then! <br/>
<br/>
Just our 2 cents....<br/>
