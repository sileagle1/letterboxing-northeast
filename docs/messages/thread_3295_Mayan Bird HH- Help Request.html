full. However, somewhere along the way the stamp seems to have been<br/>
switched out with another hitchhiker. : ( <br/>
<br/>
I loved that stamp so I beg of you... if you find yourself near<br/>
Dennis, MA or have seen or have in your possesion a hitchhiker that<br/>
doesn't belong to the log book it's with, please contact me!!! It<br/>
seems to have been swapped with a store bought feur de lis stamp, in<br/>
or around the Happy Birthday Chunna 2005 letterbox on June 21,2006.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who may have information, please let me know! It looks like a<br/>
bird, obviously.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
