The following box(es)/series are alive or require attention:<br/>
<br/>
Thomas Hill Standpipe - missing, last visited on 2/11/06, this was one<br/>
of my first Bangor plants, and I can only guess that it wasn't<br/>
re-hidden very well. This will be replanted - SOON!<br/>
<br/>
Sklar Park - in great shape. Added some new plastic zip bags. Last<br/>
visitors in November.<br/>
<br/>
Stella - great shape. Large box size for hitchhiker additions ;)<br/>
<br/>
Dancing Bubs - also, in good shape, added some plastic bags.<br/>
<br/>
Prentiss Woods - some ice crusties, but to be expected. Added some new<br/>
plastic bags, and will be downsizing the boxes to small lock'n'lock<br/>
containers in a week or so. The boxes are too large for the locations<br/>
and the logbooks are nearly full enough to justify a transition. Last<br/>
visitors to this location in march of this year!<br/>
<br/>
Arbor Way - only 1 box is still active in this location - Black bear.<br/>
It is alive and well with the last visitor in November.<br/>
<br/>
Horse Feathers - these boxes were bone dry and in great shape - not<br/>
very many visitors...<br/>
<br/>
Easter Hunt '04 - a box I placed for a friend. In great shape in a<br/>
location that is a joy to find during the right season. Bring a picnic<br/>
in good weather and enjoy the butterfly garden nearby.<br/>
<br/>
and this brings me to Rocky and Bullwinkle. This darn Moose is still<br/>
on the loose, and to date, not that many finders have accomplished<br/>
this fantastic series of Isosceles'. I highly suggest the search for<br/>
it is well worth the effort. These are still in tact though I might<br/>
wait for mudseason to subside.<br/>
<br/>
The Standpipe will be replaced soon.<br/>
Letterboxing in Maine to go offline for good as well.<br/>

well, I made sure of it because poor hiding is a pet peave of mine..<br/>
Problem may be that during the winter there is no foliage to camoflage<br/>
what we were doing in such a highly residential area. <br/>
We felt "exposed". <br/>
