<br/>
I set this last one up for a Sunday because my February Saturdays filled up <br/>
fast, with family obligations, etc.  And we all know how well planning it for <br/>
that specific day turned out for me.  ;)  At least it sounds like *you guys* <br/>
had fun!  ;)  I'm really glad it went on without me.  If I was laying around <br/>
puking all day *and* I knew that I'd derailed plans for 27+ people, I would have <br/>
been sick and guilty.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, I will plan a March drive-by, and I will plan it for a Saturday.  I <br/>
have to check my calendar and see which Saturday will work best.  :)<br/>
