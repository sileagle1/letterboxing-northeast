I am pleased to announce I have reached another milestone.  I knew I <br/>
was comming close, and it was just a matter of time.  Today I went to <br/>
Rocky Neck State Park to finish up the boxes there that I started last <br/>
year.  When I got to Pineappletopia of the Fruit of the Dune series by <br/>
Laurie, I hit F 500!<br/>
<br/>
I also found another box after that to start on my next 500.  It is <br/>
unlucky to stop at a round number.<br/>
<br/>
So I have kept my New Year's resolution to enlarge my F-ness.  Now I <br/>
know Wanda is watching for me to enlarge my P-ness also.  Don't worry, <br/>
I have a three box series in the works.  It is in a place where there <br/>
are no boxes yet (amazing).  The only thing I will say is it will be a <br/>
long hike with my first hand carved stamps.<br/>
