But I am enviously reading all the comments about the gathering and I was curious.....It sounds like there were a LOT of letterboxers there. How did you manage to all stay discreet as you were all roaming around hunting out the letterboxes? Anyone have any stories they would like to share about how they accomplished this? Just curious! <br/>

Tatanka and I went for the remote, rougher terrain boxes on the <br/>
Friday before and the Sunday after the Event.  We didn't run into <br/>
anyone at *all* on the trails.  In fact, we were the first finders on <br/>
a lot of these boxes (Who Let The Dogs Out, in particular, which we <br/>
did first in honor of Tatanka's dog, Shane).<br/>
<br/>
As for the boxes at the event (The Great Pumpkin, The 10 Monsters), <br/>
there was *NO* attempt at discretion!  Huge hordes of folks went out <br/>
in packs.  It was hysterical!<br/>
<br/>
Our F count isn't nearly as high as the rest of the bunch because we <br/>
did have Shane with us, and we deferred to his liking (long long <br/>
hikes instead of in-and-out-of-the-truck).  He was one tired dog at <br/>
the end of the day!<br/>
