                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1678124908">Hey all ...<br/>
<br/>
Had a nice Saturday 'boxing with Lundy and Choi up in Andover.  Our <br/>
main purpose was to collect the Stairway to Heaven series in Ward <br/>
Reservation, but also (for me) to pick up the other boxes along the way.<br/>
<br/>
After doing well with our walk up Boston Hill, checking on one of <br/>
Choi's boxes, and assisting in the planting of another, we headed over <br/>
to Holt Hill and the final part of our hunt.<br/>
<br/>
Although Lundy and Choi already had found Tung 'n' Gruve's Due North, I <br/>
had not, so while Lundy went off to pull the last Stairway to Heaven <br/>
series box, I hunted Due North ... and came back instead with an <br/>
orphaned box!<br/>
<br/>
The box was a mess, only sopping wet paper and no logbook.  A very <br/>
rudimentary stamp found in the box seemed odd and there was no <br/>
reference to the box's name or placer.<br/>
<br/>
Upon deciphering what we could from the papers we found, we discovered <br/>
that Team Randalstik had happened upon the box in the same manner I <br/>
had -- while looking for Due North.  The stamp turned out to be one <br/>
carved by the youngest member of the Randalstik team -- aged 5 (which <br/>
explained the carving)!<br/>
<br/>
When I first found the box, Choi and Lundy had thought I might of found <br/>
another orphaned box -- Girl Scout Troop #3703 -- but it was not.  Sure <br/>
enough, however, based on Lundy's memory, we also found the remains of <br/>
that box as well -- far off of where the clues directed us.<br/>
<br/>
There we sat upon the solistice stones atop of Holt Hill with four <br/>
letterboxes -- the fourth Stairway to Heaven series box, Due North, and <br/>
two orphans!  Of course, with all the boxes out at the same time, we <br/>
had to be careful to remember what was what!<br/>
<br/>
We ran into another letterboxer on the hill -- someone new to the hobby <br/>
we guessed -- but he didn't stick around long enough to chat or <br/>
exchange with any of us.<br/>
<br/>
After logging into Due North and Stairway to Heaven, we contemplated <br/>
what to do with our two orphans.  We had plenty of fresh bags to <br/>
repackage the boxes, and Choi had one extra logbook.  We decided to <br/>
spruce up and replant the unnamed orphan -- which Choi <br/>
rechristened "Flying Spider's Orphan" after the little carver who had <br/>
left his contribution in the box!  We replanted it in a slightly <br/>
different location to move it away from Due North and Choi officially <br/>
adopted it (Team Randalstick -- if you would like to adopt it instead, <br/>
please let Choi know as I'm certain he will turn it over to you).<br/>
<br/>
As for the Girl Scout Troop, we couldn't spruce it up quite as much as <br/>
we had no more extra logbooks, but we did hide it in a better location <br/>
and revised the clues accordingly.  That box is currently listed as <br/>
adopted by me, although I may pass it off to Choi as it will be easier <br/>
for him to maintain.<br/>
<br/>
So -- look for two old but new letterboxes out there atop the hills of <br/>
Andover!<br/>
<br/>
And thanks to Lundy and Choi for hunting with me!<br/>
