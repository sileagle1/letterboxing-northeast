I am so surprised with the numbers of letterboxes in the immediate <br/>

As our newest homesteaders, Team Green Dragon, can attest, it doesn't <br/>
take very long to have visited every letterbox in our area. We also do <br/>
have semi-permanent visitors like the the von der Insels to help.<br/>

So far I've only gotten to some of Bicycle George's MBTA boxes, loved <br/>
the clues. I have a whole bunch of clues printed, and although it is a <br/>
bit nippy out, can't wait to grab them after work. So many boxes in <br/>
such a small area!</div>

Today we went down to Cape Cod and loved the Woods End box at Eel <br/>
