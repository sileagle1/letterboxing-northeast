This is why I will never place a box into a stone wall, historic or <br/>
not. It is unneccessary with all the places one can use *near* a stone <br/>
wall (and use it as a landmark in the clues). <br/>

Many people still don't have that straight in the their heads.  A pace is 2 foot falls. (left and right or right and left)  A step is each time you put your foot on the ground.  Also, the person who hid the box last, stuck it way in and up on a rock in the cave so it wasn't easy to spot.  Thanks for everyone's comments.

<br/>
<br/>
I wholeheartedly agree -- not just about stone walls, but about flora <br/>
in general.  I'm always mildy dismayed when hunting for boxes to <br/>
discover their exact location without much effort because of a <br/>
noticable "letterboxer's trail" to the box.  We are all familiar with <br/>
the SPORs and SPOTs -- and many you can probably see these <br/>
little "paths" that lead off trail as well.  Sometimes they are as <br/>
obvious as crushed ferns or other plant life, but often they are as <br/>
seemingly benign as the lack of flora where it should likely be.<br/>
<br/>
The challenge is that, perhaps suprisingly, it takes very little to <br/>
destroy ground vegetation in the woods.  There is a distinct reason <br/>
why most conservation and park agencies demand people to stay on <br/>
trail.  While in order to participate in this hobby, I'm willing <br/>
to "bend" that rule a little to forage off trail slightly, I implore <br/>
planters -- and finders -- to consider and be cautious of the <br/>
potential damage you may due to the plants along the way.  Most <br/>
woodland groundcover is not like the grass on your front lawn -- it <br/>
cannot sustain multiple people trampling it.  The result is the lack <br/>
of vegegation in a certain area -- the start of a new trail, in <br/>
essence -- as recognizable to me as our wonderful SPORs are.  As with <br/>
SPORs, most non-letterboxers won't notice, but those of us with now-<br/>
trained eyes do, and we recognize that what we are noticing is <br/>
nothing less than destructive.<br/>
<br/>
I have boxes located in stone walls -- and in tree hollows -- and in <br/>
other various natural crooks and caverns.  My hope, nay, my <br/>
insistence, is that hunters of my boxes do their best to ensure that <br/>
they follow the "Leave No Trace" principle to the fullest as <br/>
(hopefully) I have tried to do as well.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
