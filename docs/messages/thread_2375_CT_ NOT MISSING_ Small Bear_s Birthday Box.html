I'm sorry to say however, that the wall near the box was torn apart!  It looks like people were tearing apart the wall to find the box.  The box IS NOT in the wall.  It was NEVER in the wall.  The clues DO NOT say it's in the wall.  It was always under the leaning tree by the flat boulder.   <br/>

PLEASE DO NOT TEAR APART STONE WALLS, PAINSTAKINGLY BUILT BY FARMERS AND WORKERS LONG AGO.  BE SMART IN YOUR LETTERBOX HUNTING.<br/>
