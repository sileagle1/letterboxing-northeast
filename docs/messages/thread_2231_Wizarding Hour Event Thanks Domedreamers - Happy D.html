                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-909698235">I managed to get there about 10 or 11-ish with long-absent Betz.  I really liked the HP stamp ~ very nice work indeed.  I exchanged with the Domedreamers and left the Happy Dance HH with them.  They will have to figure out how to stamp part of that mystery event stamp into the HD-HH log book. <br/>
<br/>
Happy Dance is a beautifully made HH.  We already had that box and moved it along a long time ago. Another boxer had given me the heads-up that it was at our Demented Directions Mystery box a couple of weeks ago. I kept an eye on it because although this HH is meant to travel between mystery boxes, that means that it may sit an awful long while unattended.   I noticed on Geocaching.com that someone has planted a cache just feet from our mystery box and our box has already been accidentally discovered by cachers.  Rather than take a chance on this little gem of a HH going missing, I asked Dan to snag it from our box so I could move it along.  The Wizarding Hour was cryptic enought to be a mystery!  So the Happy Dance HH is on the move again. Thanks, Domedreamers, for taking it into your care.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't notice many 'boxers about.  I was hoping to run into Music Woman and I brought the wedding photos. But Betz wanted to see Willy Wonka first so we got to the Waldenbooks just before book sales began.  The rest of the evening at the mall was spent waiting for Betz to get her book.  I saw one mom with long blond hair showing off her event stamp image to a clerk. She was very happy to have gotten this great image.  She didn't keep her brood there too long though, and opted to get a "reservation" on a book rather than keep them up.  I was too tired to start an exchange by that time.  I remained anonymous.  <br/>
<br/>
We came back to RI via 395S to 95N and we hit some dense fog patches. It was slow-going and squinty for miles. I really think that Dunkin Donuts shops should catch up in CT.  In RI they are plentiful and many are 24hrs. Not so in CT!!!  What that state holds in letterboxes we match with DD shops!  ;-)  It was a brutal ride home without my DD coffee. It had been about 5 pm when  I last had one. I was getting grumpy.  After getting Dan from Prov I had driven about 170 miles. :::phew:::  Sans caffeine.  (And no, no mongrel knock-off "Dandy Donuts" coffee was acceptable.  I do have my standards.)  I mean, c'mon, CT... If you're going to keep the roads dark and dreary without adeqate lighting, I would like to see a few more orange and pink coffee shop signs to light the way. <br/>

  Thank you Domedreamers for making the one night event letterbox "The Wizarding Hour". It turned out to also be a nice mini gathering. Boxers came from 3 states, CT, RI and NY. <br/>

You must have been in "that" part of Connecticut  ;-D<br/>
Come a little farther west and you will find pink and orange every half mile.<br/>
Why, our little town has 4 shops!<br/>
<br/>
Glad you made it home safely in the fog.<br/>

<br/>
"A Dunkin' Donuts on every corner! A Dunkin' Donuts on every corner!"  I'd raise my cup high in the air and chant this every time a new one opened...<br/>
<br/>
I did actually see a few a Dunkin' but they were, alas, closed. Even the one just a short distance from the mall was closed when we finally rolled out of Norwich. What's an addict to do?  I did see a Tim Horton's proclaiming 24 hrs but the lights were off...  :::sigh:::<br/>
<br/>
I think I know the location of almost every shop in my little state. We just may have the distinction of having most DD per square mile in the world.<br/>
<br/>
At least I know my needs should be met down New Haven way. :-)<br/>
