Quest and then go on to Coventry.  As much as I love to letterbox, I <br/>
did not go out again this weekend- my fingers just got too cold <br/>
stamping in.  Swamp Yankee met up with M.W. yesterday, but I whimped <br/>
out!!!  Has anyone done the Irish Tinker series mentioned in the <br/>
subject of this post lately?? We looked and looked for box #2, but <br/>
came up empty.  All other boxes were found as well as, Corney, <br/>
Charter Oak's Grandson, CT State Stamp, and Pumped Up.  All boxes <br/>
were in fine shape.  Happy Boxing Everyone- Sunshine :0)</div>
