<br/>
Hopefully he will join the group here, but if not, please email him directly if you would like to plant a box. (I changed his email so yahoo wouldn't hide it from you, just change things back to normal to contact him).<br/>
<br/>
Happy spring, Jay in CT<br/>

Hello! <br/>
 I began letterboxing a few months ago as part of some research I'm doing for a <br/>
summer camp program on Treasure Hunting. The camp, called Explo, takes place at <br/>
Wellesley College, MA, during the last six weeks of the summer. I am an <br/>
instructor for the camp charged with creating a Treasure Hunting curriculum, <br/>
within which I'd like to incorporate letterboxing. <br/>
 I am writing because I need help. My students (6th-8th grade) will be confined <br/>
to Wellesley's campus, and there is only one letterbox planted on the campus, <br/>
the directions for which are fairly straightforward and don't involve any <br/>
compass use. I live in Pittsburgh, and fear I will not arrive at Wellesley in <br/>
time to (cleverly) hide two letterboxes and write and encode directions before <br/>
camp begins. <br/>
 I saw an old news article that mentioned John Chapman lived near Wellesley and <br/>
hid letterboxes there. If he or anyone in the Wellesley college area wants to <br/>
hide a couple of letterboxes on campus for me, please let me know. The <br/>
directions need to be somewhat cryptic (enough that it'll take an hour or so for <br/>
a group of students to find them) and incorporate some wayfinding with a <br/>
compass. <br/>
 I know this is a lot to ask but if anyone is interested in helping out I'd <br/>
really appreciate it. Also, any advice on box placement or writing directions <br/>
would be great. I can be reached through email at <a href="mailto:a.tyler.nelson@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a.tyler.nelson@...</a>. <br/>
 Thanks for your help and for promoting letterboxing! <br/>
<br/>
Yours truly,<br/>
 Adam Nelson<br/>
