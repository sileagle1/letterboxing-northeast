<br/>
Out of curiousity, I was looking at the number of published boxes in<br/>
New England (3,297) and starting thinking -- has anybody made it a<br/>
goal to clear a state?<br/>
<br/>
Now that I've started 'boxing in Connecticut, I've made it a goal to<br/>
clear towns.  For example, a full 'boxing day in Eastford a month or<br/>
so ago picked up all the boxes in that town except one (of course<br/>
someone has since planted another box there since my hunt).  A similar<br/>
attempt in the town of Ashford was somewhat successful, until foiled<br/>
by the challenge of Paige's Tales.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway ... although a state like Connecticut, with over 1600 published<br/>
boxes (and hundreds more WOM) might take years to "clear", a state<br/>
like Rhode Island (250 published) or Vermont (75 published) might not.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, my weekends are rather full in the fall, and clearing a<br/>
state requires some serious effort, but it's gotten me thinking that<br/>
maybe, just maybe, I'll concetrate most of my letterboxing hunts in a<br/>
particular state in an attempt to clear it.  Hmmm ... Rhode Island<br/>
here I come?<br/>

that idea of doing all the boxes in a particular state like we've <br/>
been trying to do for years!  Besides our home state of RI, where we <br/>
have  found over 500 boxes, not counting our own several dozen, of <br/>
course, we used to mostly concentrate on CT. Every time we'd get <br/>
within a box or two of completing CT, out would come another dozen or <br/>
so boxes! Ultimately, between bonuses, add-ons, WOM's and many boxes <br/>
that have come and gone, we figured it would be pretty impossible to <br/>
get them all! In fact, it was pretty amusing to us to see that the <br/>
total number of boxes listed on LbNA for ALL of New England is <br/>
several hundred LESS than the number of boxes we have already found <br/>
just in CT alone!!! <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it's a nice goal, but the idea of "filling" a state can be <br/>
just as fun as "clearing" one. After all, when we first started out <br/>
letterboxing, there was only one box in the entire state of Nevada - <br/>
a Mapsurfer at the complete other end of the state from where we were <br/>
going - so it was absolutely thrilling to be able to double the count <br/>
of Nevada boxes by planting two boxes near Las Vegas, instead <br/>
of "clearing the state" of its one! And if we ever get to North <br/>
Dakota, we'll hope to double the box count there as well!:-)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this "letterboxing party" goes on for a long time yet to come, <br/>
and that we never actually "clear" any of the states, as new boxes <br/>
continue to get planted, even as old boxes go missing or "retire"!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers and thanks,<br/>
<br/>

I'd hate to think that.</div>
