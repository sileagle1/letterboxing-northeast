stamp for the event and everyone there gets the image. I then carve <br/>
out a portion like the date of the event or some piece and the <br/>
revised stamp is issued as a box or HH. Then the event one is unique <br/>
and the rest of the LB workd can have a piece of the fun. This might <br/>
not work with every image but I have chosen some ahead because it <br/>
would work well.  Leader of the Pack</div>

something in a corner that is then removed. The stamp then can be circulated for <br/>
everyone's enjoyment. Placing the box at the site of the gathering would be nice.<br/>
