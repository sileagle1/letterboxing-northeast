I saw the image of the stamp was supposed to be a dog body with a fish tail. The whole area was also incredibly overgrown with some vine. Sorry your box was wrecked! <br/>

 <br/>
I did replant this box and put it in a slightly different location.<br/>
 <br/>
Please check the clues if you are going out that way to find this one. <br/>
 <br/>
Hopefully this one will last longer as it will not be replaced again.<br/>
