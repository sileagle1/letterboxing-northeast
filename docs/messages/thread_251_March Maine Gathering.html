The date for the "Letterboxing at Laudholm" gathering will be Sunday, <br/>
March 21st from 11 am to 4 pm to be held at the Wells National <br/>
Estuarine Research Reserve in Wells, Maine. There will be a potluck <br/>
lunch from 11 to 12:30 with plenty of boxes planted on the 7 miles of <br/>
trails here - some just for the day and some new ones that will <br/>
remain here permanently.<br/>
More details coming soon including a potential exciting guest speaker <br/>
(let me clarify- she's definitely exciting, but we have to make sure <br/>
she can definitely come- that's the part that is potential). <br/>
Nautilus and Phyto will be co-hosting this event but would welcome <br/>
the assistance or suggestions of others.<br/>
Kindly let us know if you plan on attending so we can get an idea of <br/>
numbers. You can respond on the list or to either Phyto or myself <br/>
directly via e-mail. Thanks!<br/>

there, so heating it up shouldn't be a problem. We'll also be using real <br/>
