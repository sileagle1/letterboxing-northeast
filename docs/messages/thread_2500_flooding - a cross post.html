and the dam breaking. there is a lot of boxes in the<br/>
hillsboro/washington/henniker etc. area planted by rtrw and uneksia. it<br/>
would be wise to not plan on searching for them until i have a chance to<br/>
check them out. hopefully this week or weekend. we lost our furnace in the<br/>
floods so are dealing with no heat right now and some foundation damage. i<br/>
will also be checking on any other boxes that could have been damaged or<br/>
lost in the floods. will make a report as soon as the water recedes enough<br/>
to get to the spots. <br/>
