The snow is FINALLY leaving! A strong wind is blowing.... so the mud <br/>
will be drying up....<br/>
<br/>
And I heard this is going to be LOTS of fun! Having never been to a <br/>
gathering - and I got snowed in for the last one - I can't wait to go <br/>
to this one!<br/>
<br/>
Has EVERYONE signed up? Maine is beautiful in April... flowers <br/>
blooming, buds on trees, the air is clear - and NO BUGS yet!<br/>
<br/>
Though I know there will be cooties a plenty! Come and join in the fun! <br/>
I want to meet EVERYONE!!!!!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
And I'm bringing the BIG pot of coffee for those firmly addicted to <br/>
liquid gold!  Brews 100 cups at a time : )</div>
