                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-593918369">Well, seeing as how Rhode Island and Massachusetts have declared states of <br/>
emergency due to what they're calling Blizzard '05, I would say that the <br/>
same would be true for letterboxes in the New England area as well. When all <br/>
of this snow is over, most letterboxes in the area will be under at least a <br/>
foot of snow. That means that, when spring thaw finally arrives, there will <br/>
be LOTS of water and any boxes in low-lying areas or any that are close to <br/>
streams/rivers/etc. will be in danger of being lost. Any damaged and/or <br/>
non-waterproof boxes will likely get soaked right through. Also, the winds <br/>
are quite strong, (sometimes reaching tropical storm strength!) so trees are <br/>
likely to be blown around a bit resulting in lots of fallen branches. All of <br/>
this chaos may result in damaged or lost boxes so I personally will be <br/>
contacting every placer of boxes that I find/can't find for the next few <br/>
weeks to let them know what kind of shape their boxes are in, for better or <br/>
for worse. I think that if everyone who ventures out in the next few weeks <br/>
contacts the placer to let them know how their box is doing one way or the <br/>
other, there will be a lot less confusion when spring arrives. I mean, <br/>
haven't we all followed the clues to a box only to find that it was missing <br/>
but not reported as such on the LbNA website? Rather than let that happen, <br/>
we should band together and make sure that placers know the condition of <br/>
their boxes even if they are not able to check on them themselves. Better <br/>
communication equals less confusion, right?<br/>

going to be carrying some extra baggies and logbooks, so whatever it is that I <br/>

tell me if my boxes need some TLC, and everyone whose boxes I've "helped" has <br/>
been very appreciative as well.  :)<br/>

</span></blockquote>Oh contrary to this statement - Maine is alive and well - and boxes<br/>
are being planted as you sit here and read this... (rubs hands<br/>
together mischeviously) so, when the spring thaw finally arrives and<br/>
all the snow instantly sublimes to fog when the radiant sunbeams hit<br/>
the crystalline snowflakes, the water instantly evaporates and not a<br/>
drop remains in our preccccciiouuussss - doh! - I mean letterbox.<br/>

boxes.  I will update the clues if there are reports that would <br/>
indicate trouble.  Something like "Reported missing but not <br/>
verified".<br/>
