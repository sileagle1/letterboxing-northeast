relatives live right in the middle of all the quests.  It  is basically a book of <br/>
letterboxes created by school classes and other people in  the community <br/>
designed to share their special places with others.  Go on  line to <br/>
_www.vitalcommunities.org_ (http://www.vitalcommunities.org)   and click on the icon for <br/>
Valley Quest for more info.<br/>
