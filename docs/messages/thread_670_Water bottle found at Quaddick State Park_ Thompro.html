It was wedged up in a tree. We thought we remembered someone saying on the day of the gathering that someone had lost a water bottle. This bottle is in a black and red insulated covering. If it's yours, contact us and we will make arrangements for you to get it back.....Chuck, Chickabirdie and Molly<br/>
