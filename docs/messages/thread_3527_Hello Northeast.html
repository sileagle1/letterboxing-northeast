It grows in clumps on the ground like an innocent ground cover, up to big bushes that will swallow you whole. ;-)  Trust me on this, I fell into one. It also will grow into a thick, hairy vine that will engulf, choke, and suck the life out of a full-grown oak. I'm not kidding. Come to RI and be amazed. Someday we will disappear into a p-ivy patch between CT and MA, and people will forget RI was ever here. (Though, many people already don't know we are here, and think we are part of NY. But I digress...)<br/>
<br/>
Please let us know if you want to chance boxing here.  We are not careful or carful...  we are caffel here, and we won't let it get you if you box with us.<br/>

Thanks everyone for the great welcome here in the board! So far I have <br/>
found 5 boxes here in CT. One of them was one of the CT state park <br/>
boxes. I think it is great that the state premotes letterboxing like <br/>
that. One thing I noticed about the trails here is all the poision ivy. <br/>
I have never seen so much of it before. I guess I will just have to be <br/>
extra carful. <br/>

Very quick... good for a leg stretch.<br/>

On the way over to Newport you can stop at this one in Jamestown... another<br/>
quick one<br/>

This one says it's missing, but if you are going to be right there anyway<br/>
(and if you are in Newport then at some point you will be at Brenton Point!)<br/>
it's an easy one worth the try since it sounds like the planters haven't<br/>
checked for themselves yet, so perhaps it is there!<br/>

  We are headed to RI, Newport area, for a family<br/>
  reunion on July 21. Anyone from that area want to<br/>
  tell what their favorite boxes are in that area?<br/>

  arms are itchy-rashy. It's just beginning to clear<br/>
  up. Never had a problem with it ever in my life and I<br/>
  am 52 years old!<br/>

  Also I do think Skyscraper is missing but it's still worth the short walk to the location to give it a try, it's a real nice walk.  Lots of bunnies there! <br/>

&gt; Sorry to get in here late Ryan but wanted to welcome you as well. <br/>
Don't know if you remember us but we met several years ago at the Great <br/>
Lakes Gathering in MI.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope to see you again soon. Welcome to box-rich CT!<br/>

  Funny you should mention that box. I have wanted to go looking for it for some time and thought about doing it soon, but I think I'll wait until it's not so busy in Newport. I'm a little nervous that if I find it, I'll give it away. I just checked with the placer and it seems to still be there. Something to continue to look forward to!<br/>

  Our favorite box in Newport is "land sailing" <a href="http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/drewclan/coastal.htm#Land" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/drewclan/coastal.htm#Land</a> <br/>
<br/>
  Just a warning it is a fairly long walk, and hidden very well in a busy location. <br/>
  Still, great clues and one of our most memorable finds.<br/>
