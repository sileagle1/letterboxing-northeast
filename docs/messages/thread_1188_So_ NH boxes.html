I'm just starting and having a great time, though my significant <br/>
others are not so intrigued. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway...<br/>
<br/>
Gilson Road Letterbox, Nashua - a quick almost drive by box; found <br/>
in fine condition<br/>
<br/>
Rosemary's Shower, Sunapee - quick and fun while visiting the <br/>
Sunapee Craft Fair<br/>
<br/>
1886 box, Nashua - an easy find, good condition<br/>
<br/>
Mines Falls Park - a really nice walk and the box was fine<br/>
<br/>
Max &amp; Jack Cheese, Amherst - another great place for a walk, a fun <br/>
and informative box<br/>
<br/>
Ponemah Bog, Amherst - Always wanted to visit this spot and <br/>
letterboxing brought me out there. Box intact and drier than we were <br/>
as it was a rainy day when we went and water dripping from the <br/>
shrubs and trees made my fleece weight about 20 lbs.<br/>
<br/>
Susie Sells Seashells, Rye- found intact, nice view.<br/>
<br/>
Hollyberry letterbox, Exeter- a bit of a challenge to be discrete. <br/>
Box there and intact.<br/>
<br/>
Elizabeth Jane Garner Bouruereau, Exeter - Again intact, a nice walk <br/>
along the river.<br/>
<br/>
That's it so far...</div>
