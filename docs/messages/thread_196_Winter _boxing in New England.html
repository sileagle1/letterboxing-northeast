I like going for hikes, but I also like unfrozen digits - so I think I'll wait until the temperatures rise to the 30's.<br/>

  Dave and I just got back from a foray to check on our 'Creek Letterbox' in Vermont. We grabbed a couple of our friends from Burlington and headed south. The snow kept us from finding too much and the 'creek 'box' is pretty iced up. We think it's still there, but couldn't pry up the rocks that were frozen together. We did find a letterbox along 91 North that was not snowed in! It felt good to come home with at least one find. ;) We'll save the rest until a bit of a thaw. <br/>
