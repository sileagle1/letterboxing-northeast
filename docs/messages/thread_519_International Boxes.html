                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1797120491">Hi everyone, Happy Easter!<br/>
I was wondering if anyone knew how to access clues for boxes in <br/>
Mexico?  The main site says there are two there, but I can't find <br/>
the clues.  I will be heading down in two weeks and would love to <br/>
drop off a hitchhiker I found today.  Any help would be much <br/>
appreciated!<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Peace Amy</div>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>You might want to talk with the person that placed the hitchhiker <br/>
before moving it to Mexico.  They may love the idea, but it's likely <br/>
that Mexican letterboxes don't get much traffic and the hitchhiker <br/>
could languish for months or years before it's found, which the <br/>
creator of the hitchhiker may not like.  So it might not be a bad <br/>
idea to ask permission before moving it out of the country.<br/>
<br/>
If the hitchhiker is one of mine, I'd love for it to make a trip to <br/>
Mexico, though.  :)<br/>

</span></blockquote>Wish I could help you there, but I don't know anything about the <br/>
boxes in Mexico either.  *shrug*  If you want to visit Guatemala, <br/>
though, I'm your guy!  :)<br/>
