We were able to find The Little Red Schoolhouse and Blue Jay at Blue Pond as well as North-South Trail - Oceanside. All of these boxes were alive and well in South County RI.<br/>
We also found the Genie's Lamp HH. Must be good luck for the von der Insels, we found a HH in our very first box 2 years ago!<br/>
