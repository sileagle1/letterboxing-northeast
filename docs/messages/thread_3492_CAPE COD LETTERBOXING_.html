later this evening and hoped that someone might see this post and be <br/>
able to help.   We will be staying in Mashpee, and would like any <br/>
information on any letterboxes within a fair drive that you might <br/>
recommend to us.  With the price of gasoline, I'd appreciate any <br/>
help... I would hate to just go searching aimlessly and come up empty <br/>
handed.   Thank you so much for any help!</div>
