I have never been happier to see the retirement of a box I did not <br/>
find. My mother is jumping for joy. My grandmother was 2 years old the <br/>
last time the Sox won and she was thankfully lucid today  for long <br/>
enough to understand that the boys had won again and share a big smile.<br/>
<br/>
OK, back to your regularly scheduled program. Never mind those of us <br/>
dancing along the streets today - heck, we're half convinced there was <br/>
an obscure rule change that will be invoked to declare STL the winner <br/>
within a week. I mean, a Sox team without heartbreak????  ;-)<br/>

needs to be "86'd" is there any way you can wait 86 days to retire the<br/>
