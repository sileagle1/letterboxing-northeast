a zine dedicated to all things letterboxing called Letterboxine. This is the creation of the <br/>
very talented and creative Team Radandalstik.<br/>
<br/>
  It's loaded with all kinds of good letterboxing stories, poems, info and my favorite- an <br/>
interview with Warrior Woman where she reveals the origin of her trailname. Watch out <br/>
nosey RV people, she's armed now (with a signature stamp)! <br/>
<br/>
  If you were fortunate enough to get the premier issue at the Event, curl up with your copy <br/>
and be amazed. This is just the thing to tide us over from one event to the next and <br/>
actually creates a new niche for the written word. I wish Team Randalstik the best of luck <br/>
with future issues and hope we get details soon on how to get future issues. Bravo!! <br/>
