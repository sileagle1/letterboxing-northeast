<br/>
I am taking 2 weeks off, 9-20.July, and I would like to try doing some <br/>
of the "Four Directions" series:  <a href="http://4directionsmain.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://4directionsmain.blogspot.com/</a> <br/>
I normally 'box alone but these are too demanding and remote for my <br/>
usual M.O.; a second vehicle alone, if not extra eyes, seems prudent.<br/>
<br/>
Any folx interested in doing one or two of the Four Directions?  Reply <br/>
here or e-mail/PM.  I'm open to suggestions so if you've done some/part <br/>
of the series and want to finish/pick-up where you left off, I have no <br/>
preference as I've done none of it.  Going where the wind blows...<br/>
