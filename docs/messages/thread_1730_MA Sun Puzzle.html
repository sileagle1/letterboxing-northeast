Placer option, and also posted to this listserv about the missing box,<br/>
but never heard back. Too bad, because I really like the first stamp<br/>
and would love to have the second half of the sun face.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for writing.  I'm pertty certain we had the right spot, but all we found in the tree was a dollar bill. If you ever hear from anyone about the box, please let me know.  If I hear anything, I'll contact you. I try to keep up with the list but sometimes it's overwhelming and my delete key takes over.  ;-)  <br/>
