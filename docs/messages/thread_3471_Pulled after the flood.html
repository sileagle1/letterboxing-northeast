I have had a lot going on in my life, so before last week it had been since September since I went out.  It felt great to finally get back out there after so long.  Last week I did the "Raggedy Ann and Andy and the Wishing Well" series in Vernon, CT and yesterday I did the "Rainbow Row" series in Manchester, CT.<br/>
<br/>
In addition I finally got around to planting the "Ship it" series I carved over a year ago.  Its in the Nike Recreational Area, the same trail that I used to have "The Great Race" series.  Here are the clues for those interested:<br/>

<br/>
Hopefully things will stay calm for a little while so I can get a lot more boxing done this summer.  See you guys on the trail<br/>
