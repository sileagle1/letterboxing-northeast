I'd been planning on doing it since TT mentioned it, and even took a ride with Betz to find the place.  But Real Life conspired against our trip.  Betz has issues at home, my husband told me that he absolutely cannot take any time off now, and we couldn't even try to jump on the Free Campsite for the weekend because of another commitment tomorrow. So if I attempted the Sun.-Wed., that would mean me alone with the camper. That's just not going to do. I can't imagine backing that camper into a wooded spot by myself and doing all the things that Dan does routinely with that camper. Sometimes you just gotta let things go...<br/>
<br/>
We may take a day trip out to the cape and try to catch up with the group. I have a few 'boxers cell phone numbers.  I hope you all have great weather and a good time 'boxing.  The weather should be mahhhvelous.<br/>
