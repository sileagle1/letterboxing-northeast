                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-141973126">Hey fellow NE letterboxers...<br/>
<br/>
Some of you may have wondered where I've been lately.  I'm still<br/>
around, although I've been on a hiatus from letterboxing the last 5 or<br/>
so weeks.  As I shared with some of you at the Mystery Gathering,<br/>
Anjabanja and I are no longer a couple.  It's a sad thing but both us<br/>
realized that the relationship had gone as far as it could and it was<br/>
time to part ways.  We've expressed our interest in remaining friends,<br/>
and have stayed in touch somewhat, but only time will tell whether<br/>
things can successfully transform.<br/>
<br/>
Anja was my companion and best friend for the time we were together<br/>
and when I happened upon letterboxing last May she was the first I<br/>
told about it.  We started participating in this hobby together and<br/>
although we didn't use a team name we were very much a team.<br/>
<br/>
When the relationship came to an official end, I lost my motivation to<br/>
continue the hobby for a while.  This is principally because I am the<br/>
type of person who finds significantly more enjoyable in doing things<br/>
with someone else thus being able to share experiences rather than do<br/>
them alone.  Matter-of-fact, I am usually not interested in doing<br/>
things by myself.  As much as I truly enjoy letterboxing, I could not<br/>
see myself enjoying it as much if it were only me on the trails.<br/>
<br/>
I do not intend to abandon this hobby altogether, and may try to<br/>
engage in it solo hoping that I'll find it just as fun as I did when I<br/>
was hunting boxes with Anja.  Hopefully, it will only be a matter of<br/>
little time before I find another partner whom I can share this<br/>
wonderful hobby with.  And, who knows, perhaps Anja and I will get<br/>
together occasionally to hunt a few boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be heading back to my boyhood home (the Finger Lakes section of<br/>
NYS) this weekend for a long Thanksgiving holiday with my dad, and I<br/>
think I'll take the clues to various boxes in the area with me. <br/>
Perhaps hunting those boxes will prove that I can enjoy this hobby<br/>
solo -- we'll see.  When I return to MA, I don't know if I'll return<br/>
to actively letterboxing or not.<br/>
<br/>
So, my hiatus from this hobby may last a while, but I assure those of<br/>
you to whom I've made your acquaintence over the past five months that<br/>
I will return at some point.  And, if, in the meantime, any of you who<br/>
live near me want another member of your hunting party some weekend<br/>
day, send me a message and maybe I'll join you.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be updating my website at some point to remove much of the<br/>
journal that is there as well as strike Anja's stats from the page. <br/>
Even though we split on amicable terms and will try to remain friends,<br/>
I don't feel comfortable maintaining the "Letterboxing Adventures of<br/>
Scott and Anja" when only Scott remains.  Anja has kept her journal<br/>
and stamp, though, so you may see her continue to participate in this<br/>
hobby.<br/>
<br/>
The two boxes (Red Horse and Mary's Lamb) that were placed by Anja and<br/>
I will remain for letterboxers to hunt and I will maintain them.  The<br/>
clues will continue to be available on my website.  The third box<br/>
(Willard Clock) was in the process of being put together when the<br/>
relationship stopped; placement of this box has been indefintely<br/>
postponed.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not completely sure why I felt compelled to air my story here on<br/>
these boards, but perhaps it is because I feel a part of this<br/>
community and, as part of the community consider my fellow<br/>
letterboxers friends that care enough to wonder "what happened to<br/>
CPAScott?"  So, here I am to answer that question.<br/>
<br/>
We shall speak again.<br/>
<br/>
Fondest regards,<br/>

Like a family, we rejoice during the happy times and are saddened during the trials. I'll venture to say that your letterboxing family is here if you need us - so don't hesitate to call.<br/>

Even though we have never met personally, we feel we've met you through <br/>
your posts.  We send you our prayers and best wishes.  We too thank you <br/>
for such a difficult e-mail and I'm sure everyone who reads your e-mail <br/>
wishes both of you the best.<br/>
<br/>
If you're ever in the Southeastern part of MA and want to hunt some <br/>
weekend, drop us a line.  We could always use another hunter.<br/>

Hang in there,  and I just want to remind you  that what Mark Pepe <br/>
said,  is right.  Many folks in our letterboxing community are ready to <br/>
give support.  I can promise you that all you have to do is ask .  Don't <br/>
ever feel you must go out alone.  Someone will go, someone with talk and <br/>
someone with listen.  I know .<br/>
Happy trails<br/>
