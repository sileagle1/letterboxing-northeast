The box is cracked but totally dry inside thanks to it hidie-hole in <br/>
the wall. Ink pad fine-stamp reminds me of Elton John song "Blue <br/>
Canoe". If you do go here, please wear orange regardless of the <br/>
season. There are discarded deer parts in one corner of the lot: at <br/>
lease 3 deer heads, a ribcage and other parts in garbage bags which <br/>
leads me to believe this is an area where hunters are illegally <br/>
shooting deer. I saw lots of spent shotgun shells along the first <br/>
part of the trail, unfortunately. Also, please note that the trail <br/>
which crosses the powerlines on the way back to your car has many <br/>
overgrown prickers along it. On a positive note:  I have never ever <br/>
seen such a grand sycamore tree! Jay was sure right about there being <br/>
many a near champion tree in our N.E. forests. Re. replacement box: <br/>
it has to be the same size so as to fit its' spot.  It is a small <br/>
flat rectangular box with tan lid (maybe Glad brand??).  Jay <br/>
frequently uses this size box.<br/>
