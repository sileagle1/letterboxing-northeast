                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1996674850">The Connecticut Audubon Society is having their 2010 Earth Fair on Saturday April 24 from 10 am to 3 pm. They are interested in having a letterboxing information booth there. They are adjacent to Earle Park where there are several boxes, and they are very letterbox friendly.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone who could come to the fair and man the booth? Do we have display boards with general info that we could use? I can post it as an event if those who come can help explain letterboxing to the visitors.<br/>
