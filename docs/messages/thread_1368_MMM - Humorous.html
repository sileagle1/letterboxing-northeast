that was in there.  As I came out and sat in my car, I was amazed at <br/>
the number of people who came in and out.  You could tell some were <br/>
letterboxers.  It is a difficult plact to be discreet.  I think the <br/>
store owners should be commended for letting all of track thru her <br/>
store.  Buy a grinder - they are the best.  and don't forget the <br/>
other lb in the store!  <br/>
