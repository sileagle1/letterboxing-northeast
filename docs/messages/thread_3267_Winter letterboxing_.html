cup of coffee or even a meal while boxing. Re. outdoor boxes: snow <br/>
shoes, x.c. skis and small hand held garden-type spades (mine is made <br/>
of bright orange plastic) do come in handy. If you do dig out a winter <br/>
box, just make lots of cofusing tracks around the l.b. site...walk <br/>
backwards, walk in circles, you get the idea--keep box hidden. Truly <br/>
dedicated boxers join fly south for the winter. Truly, truly dedicated <br/>
boxers migrate with the monarche butterflies to Mexico. <br/>
  Enjoy!<br/>

</span></blockquote>I used to go away to the Virgin Islands in February, but last year I<br/>
couldn't swing it so I started the "Desperately Seeking Sun" event for<br/>
my fellow northern boxers. Here in Central New York we get a LOT of<br/>
snow and a LOT of gray days in the winter. This was a feeble attempt<br/>
to have a party with other winter-bound boxers. <br/>
<br/>
The day of the event it was BITTER cold....15 below zero with the<br/>
windchill...and snow was blowing everywhere. I had no idea if anyone<br/>
would even show up, but to my surprise they came from everywhere! We<br/>
had nearly 60 people for that event and it was a LOT of fun. Great hot<br/>
food and steaming cups of coffee, tea and hot chocolate. I learned<br/>
that northern boxers are HARD CORE boxers and will box in nearly any<br/>
weather. I still remember Jiggs walking back into the lodge with<br/>
icicles hanging from his coat...<br/>
<br/>
There was plenty to do outside AND inside, so you could take your<br/>
choice of collecting exchanges and personal travelers  around the<br/>
roaring fireplace or brave the elements to get the boxes sent from<br/>
talented carvers all over the country. It was so much darn fun, we are<br/>
doing it again! Already we have nearly 50 people signed up and it<br/>
isn't even November!<br/>
<br/>
Check out the pictures of your fellow Snow Boxers, and if you would<br/>
like to join us, please do. There is also an after party called<br/>
Desperately Seeking Suds. :)   This year we have an entire lodge to<br/>
ourselves and the trails are flat..making it easy for snowshoes,<br/>
crosscountry skis or hiking. There may even be ice fishing boxes<br/>
involved...depending on the ice thickness!  As always, there are games<br/>
for the kids and a KIDS ONLY letterbox as well as a challenge for the<br/>
adults as well. The famous Lock Wench Raffle Baskets will be back and<br/>
everyone who attends gets a door prize. We'd love to have you!<br/>

I enjoy boxing in all kinds of weather, including the heart of <br/>
winter.  Sometimes the weather helps make a boxing foray a little <br/>
more special, and always more memorable.  <br/>
Just be extra careful when it's icy...been there, done that, got the <br/>
bruises (fortunately no scars)! <br/>

We live in Maine, though it is not as far north as you can get - we<br/>
are in the Central Highlands region, we still receive a fair amount of<br/>
winter. I'd say our boxing continues all year round. We enjoy this<br/>
time of year the most with less tourists and crisp fall days. The<br/>
boxing until the end of November is great in Maine - and New England<br/>
in general IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
If the weather prevents us from searching for boxes, we use the indoor<br/>
time as an opportunity to brainstorm box ideas for the upcoming spring<br/>
and summer season. It's a great time to curl up with a hot beverage<br/>
and carve some stamps, create clues and spend time repairing other<br/>
boxes from the last season. There is no shortage of letterboxing to be<br/>
done.<br/>
<br/>
There are some indoor boxes to be found as well.<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

P.S. - yes to the shovel, I have a bright orange plastic one that I<br/>
have been known to use in extruding a snow-covered box from time to<br/>
time ;)<br/>
