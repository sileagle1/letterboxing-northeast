I think a good central location would be Wild Oats in<br/>
Andover. It's the Rt.28 exit off of Rt. 495 (heading<br/>
to Andover, not Lawerence). You'll go through an<br/>
intersection with a car dealer on the left and bridal<br/>
shop on the right. Go straight until you pass a mall<br/>
area on the left (McDonald's etc) and start heading up<br/>
a hill. Wild Oats will be on the right. Have everyone<br/>
meet at the parking area to the right of the store.<br/>
<br/>
This is where we will converge...!<br/>
around 10ish or so... perhaps a bit earlier...<br/>
then box till mid afternoon<br/>
<br/>
Anyone is welcome... <br/>
questions email me <br/>
