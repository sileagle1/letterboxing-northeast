                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-856437039">While stamping in to Lunette - Zerubbabel Collins #1 in Mansfield, we found a stamp on the ground near the box.  It is a store-bought stamp in the image of a daisy.  The last people to sign in used the trail names priclwood, bucket girl, rare rose and cactus boy.  The daisy image was on this page.  I looked on AQ but these names do not come up.  If anybody knows them and they want the stamp back, please ask them to contact me.<br/>
