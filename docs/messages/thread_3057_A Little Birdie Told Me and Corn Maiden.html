One of the stamps I have is "A Little Birdie Told Me" and it's a small bird about an inch square with the wings extended upward.  It's body has a sort of Aztec or native American look to it...  cut like an angular maze within the border of the bird's outline.  The name of the box is part of the stamp. We got this image at the Mystery Gathering in RI on Sept. 20, 2003. We didn't make any notation on it as to what kind of letterbox it was or how we got the image. :-(    [Not the only one we were remiss in adding important info to our logbook over the years.]  <br/>
<br/>
There is a box by this name that is a stationary box in Washington by Wingnut so I don't think it's that box, and I know it's not the HH carved by Green Tortuga because he wrote back to me and the description of his doesn't fit.<br/>
<br/>
Can anybody identify this box for me?<br/>
<br/>
Also, it's on the same page as Corn Maiden, which was planted for that event, IIRC, right near the site, and I can't remember who carved that one. Can anyone enlighten me? <br/>

<br/>
Yes, I know, but I wote to Green Tortuga to confirm if it was or wasn't his, and he says this one is not his. It does not fit his description of his HH, which was very tiny. I thought I mentioned that in my original post. There must be yet another one out there...<br/>
<br/>
It isn't marked as a HH in my log, and most HH have at least that 2 letter designation, and usually a lot more information. &lt;shrug&gt; It may have been a plant for the day.<br/>

I got an email confirmation that ALBTM was indeed a SpringChick creation as a traveling event box, now retired. It's a nice carving, isn't it? <br/>
<br/>
But Corn Maiden, IIRC, belongs to phantom phiddler, and is also retired.<br/>

Oh, I hope Tom has another MG, but there is already so much going on this fall, I'm afraid there might be a conflict.  We are hoping to make it up to the Albany area in October.<br/>
