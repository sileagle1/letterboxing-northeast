Actually, I'd like to get an F500 badge.  If anyone has a bunch,<br/>
please let me know and I'll purchase one.  I'm 65 away, so it won't be<br/>
long.<br/>

(after the F100 one that Mapsurfer made initially disappeared), but <br/>
she didn't make an F1000 one (though it's on her "maybe someday" to do list).<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1075278194">Well, we'd heard about Mapsurfer's F100 box getting "tied up" by a <br/>
few people who were trying to reach F100, while literally hundreds of <br/>
letterboxers all around the country who had already reached that goal <br/>
were waiting for it, and could have been stamping in! Hopefully, <br/>
that  box is now well on its way again!<br/>
<br/>
The box that we have been really curious about, though, is <br/>
Mapsurfer's F500 box. He had sent it to us, with some pass-along <br/>
clues, asking that we try to keep it in chronological order and have <br/>
people stamp in their 500th box stamp, if possible. We actually <br/>
turned it into a photo album of all the people who had by then <br/>
reached F500, along with the date they attained that goal, got most <br/>
of them to stamp in at a athering at KJ's in Mansfield,CT, and then <br/>
left it in the mailbox at Dan and Melissa's house in Preston,CT (and <br/>
we still have the "thank-you" that they e-mailed us for getting it to <br/>
them, too!) <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, no one seems to have heard anything about that letterbox <br/>
for almost two years now, and quite a few more letterboxers would be <br/>
eligible to stamp in by now, too! If anyone cares to do the research <br/>
or follow-up to get that Mapsurfer box back in motion, that <br/>
would "prolly" be a good thing to do!!!Cheers,<br/>
