this weekend. We welcome one and all to join in by adding an ornament<br/>
or even ornaments. We are adding The 8 Gifts of Hanukkah to the yard<br/>
this year as well. O Letterbox Tree will once again be the large white<br/>
pine on the side of the yard. The 8 Gifts of Hanukkah will be hidden<br/>
around the shrubs beneath the lighted dreidel and menorah windows<br/>
decorations to the left of Snoopy's door. The window ornaments are due<br/>
to arrive early next week and will be affixed to the windows<br/>
immediately. After you have placed your ornaments/gifts, message<br/>
ArchimedesScrew with their names and description. She will post what<br/>
we have received so far on St. Nicholas Day, December 6th. <br/>
<br/>
Location: 40 Mockingbird Lane, West Yarmouth, same as the Haunted<br/>
Halloween Hunt<br/>
If you need further directions, let us know.</div>
