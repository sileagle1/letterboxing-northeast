hearts as we watched him fade away. It was very hard and extremely sad.<br/>
It's too good to believe, but we have another wonderful dog!  "Ace" <br/>
has been with us for 4 days.  We've taken him out on the river 3 times <br/>
and he LOVES it!!!  He seems to be a very sweet boy, well behaved, and <br/>
very willing to give us the affection we miss from our ToadDog. He is <br/>
MUCH more mellow then Toad was. For those of you who plan to attend <br/>
our gather Oct.14, you will get to meet the new dog in our lives. Go <br/>
get those 8 boxes so you can meet him!!!<br/>
