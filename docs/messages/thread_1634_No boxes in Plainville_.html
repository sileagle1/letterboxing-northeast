<br/>
There used to be a box at Norton Park in Plainville, but I think I recall it being reported as missing recently.  There's a nice walk in Cheshire, 2 boxes, called Riverbound Farms.  It's right down the street from my home and I never even realized it was there until I started letterboxing.  Check it out if you can!  Enjoy your visit with friends.<br/>
