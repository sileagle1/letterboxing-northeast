Dartmoor reunion in Leominster on Saturday:<br/>
<br/>
Native Son #8: Thomas Pecorelli [Rustypuff's PFX 1000]<br/>
Native Son #10: Major Samuel Stone Hall (Buckskin Sam)<br/>
Janet's<br/>
Native Son #9: Don Featherstone<br/>
<br/>
All were found in place, intact, and dry, however, the building<br/>
section in which Native Son #10 is hidden will soon be torn down to<br/>
make way for an addition more in keeping with the architechtural style<br/>
of the original part. The placer is aware of this situation.<br/>
<br/>
At the reunion itself, the Here There Be Pirates PLB and the Boil &amp;<br/>
Bubble HH passed through. There were also four other items that showed<br/>
up which can't readily be put into any of the established categories.<br/>
I don't think I should say anything more about them than that. The<br/>
placers/launchers will know what I'm talking about.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Deanne and Dave, and all of the other attendees, for a great<br/>
time!<br/>
