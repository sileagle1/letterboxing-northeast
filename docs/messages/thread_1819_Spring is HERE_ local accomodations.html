It's come to my attention that several of you are considering spending Saturday night in the Hudson Valley and some possibly Friday for a little extra boxing or to just avoid the long drive.  Because of the location of the gathering, hotel prices go through the roof the first couple of weeks in April.  We are just a few minutes from Marist College, Vassar College and West Point, who have commencement the following two weekends.   As an example, the rate for the Econo Lodge which is currently $54 a night jumps to $116 for Saturday May 14th (verified by myself and Jude) There are a few out of the way motels, but not only are they not aesthetically pleasing (trying to be polite here), they are usually booked solid by the numerous apple orchards in the Valley to accommodate the migrant workers (I kid you not.)<br/>
<br/>
I have an option to offer anyone interested.  I can rent the Lodge which is within the park, sleeps 20, is heated, has bathroom and shower facilities and a full kitchen.  You bring the linens, food and cooking utensil.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment with just the people who expressed interest so far, the cost for 1 night is about 1/2 that of a hotel. The more people who commit, the lower the cost and I if you are wondering, I'm not making any profit off the rental.  Anyone interested in more details please email me off list.  <br/>
<br/>
We now return to our regularly scheduled programming...<br/>
