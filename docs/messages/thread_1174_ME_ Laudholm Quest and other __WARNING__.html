Folks - I just got a report that Great Blue Heron of the Laudholm <br/>
Quest as well as Nautilus' Otter in the Pines was left out in the <br/>
open.<br/>
<br/>
Saco Heath #2 was graciously replaced by Giddy a few months ago in a <br/>
new hiding spot. It should NOT BE MOVED to the original location due <br/>
to the sensitivity of the wildlife in that location. My clues have <br/>
been updated to reflect this and it should have never been relocated.<br/>
<br/>
*****PLEASE DO NOT MOVE A BOX FROM WHERE YOU FOUND IT UNLESS YOU <br/>
NOTIFY THE PLACER.*****<br/>
<br/>
I don't in any way shape or form appreciate this as I also live a <br/>
good 3.5 hours north of this location and would not like to get in <br/>
trouble with the powers that be in that area.<br/>
<br/>
This is a warning - if my boxes are left out in the open to be <br/>
destroyed, they will ALL go away. They will be pulled until further <br/>
notice or until you can figure out how to take care of the product.<br/>

</span></blockquote> I have also found many boxes lately just thrown on the ground and <br/>
barely covered and I have noticed that more often then not they are <br/>
boxes in a series, maybe people are too anxious to get to the next <br/>
box that they aren't hiding them. Because looking for a box that <br/>
isn't even hidden is not much fun in my opinion, I've been looking <br/>
for more single boxes with longer hikes, those always seem to be <br/>
well hidden.<br/>
