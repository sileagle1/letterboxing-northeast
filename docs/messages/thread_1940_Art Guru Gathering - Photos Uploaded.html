<br/>
I would also like to thank Merenwen and Olwe for a great gathering and <br/>
giving me a chance to take my new Nikon for a spin. Mainers know how to <br/>
do it up in style... I have uploaded all the photos, so if anyone wants <br/>
to take a look, feel free. They are in the album entitled "Art Guru." <br/>
(duh)<br/>
<br/>
PLUR and Happy Trails,<br/>

We wish we could have gone, but we did stop in to Art Guru a few weeks<br/>
before the gathering and met your fine hosts. What a cool store! Once<br/>
the babe is born we'll try to make it to one of the New England<br/>
gatherings.<br/>
