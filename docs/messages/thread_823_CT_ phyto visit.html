<br/>
Just wanted to let 'yall know that I'll be coming to CT this weekend to pick up my <br/>
wedding dress (finally!). I've also got some great news. The kind gentleman from the <br/>
Warner Theater has saved my box, and I am to "pick it up at the box office" on Friday. <br/>
He was intrigued by the stamp and said that the staff was enjoying it, but I'm not <br/>
exactly sure if that means he was interested in letterboxing or not.<br/>
<br/>
I'll try and soften them up to the idea of a more fixed location for the Warner Theater <br/>
box. I'll have news on that soon.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, I'm looking forward to potentially finding the new Engraver <br/>
"EMBRACE" box (woohooo Scandal - I love it) and other new area boxes in the <br/>
Torrington/Winsted/greater Litchfield and Hartford County area. I might even take a <br/>
shot at the Mark Pepe new "Sad Clown" Mystery. If anyone wants to meet up for a <br/>
Sunday picnic keep in touch and perhaps we can get-together.<br/>
<br/>
Connecticut here I come!!<br/>
