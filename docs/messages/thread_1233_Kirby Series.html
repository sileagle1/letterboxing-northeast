clues should not be changing for awhile!<br/>
<br/>
Why I moved the boxes? If you are curious... I realized they were <br/>
rather close to a few others placed around the same time. Turned out <br/>
to be a good thing, as I think one of them was in a party spot <br/>
(judging by the strange entries in one book). The King Dedede box <br/>
has a new logbook.<br/>
