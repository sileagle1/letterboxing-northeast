</span></blockquote>For microboxes, I strongly suggest this also. I had to draw small sketches for <br/>
myself when placing Hirundo, and Portland East End has a hand-drawn map to <br/>
accompany the clues for finders. Good suggestion Northstar! <br/>
<br/>
Have you tried using the hand-drawn maps that go along with each Valley Quest? <br/>
They are a hoot! I love that small children can make such an exquisite map, it puts <br/>
some of us to shame!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing!<br/>

<br/>
A special thanks to all of you who came to the mini-gathering on <br/>
Saturday.  It was great for my students to meet other people who <br/>
share the same interest.  Your enthusiasm was apparent throught the <br/>
day and I am sure we have 6 new addicted letterboxers.  It was nice <br/>
to meet some new people.  I was especially suprised to meet Columbia <br/>
Bugs who have been letterboxing for as long as I have but we had <br/>
never met.  I hope you all enjoyed yourselves.  We will be at <br/>
Sleeping Giant next weekend on Sunday.  I hope even more people can <br/>
make it!<br/>
<br/>

It was good to meet you too. You have a great thing going on with your class. If our enthusiasm didn't get them hooked then I am sure yours will. Thank you for a great day and for all your patience with our slower hikers. <br/>
