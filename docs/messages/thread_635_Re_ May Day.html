April Showers was my series as well as  The Outhouse!  The outhouse was done as a joke to see who would realize the numbers on the wall were actually clues!  Evidently word was passed around about it (bad, bad :) ) and then someone wrote the clues down on paper and left them to be found!  But I'm glad everyone enjoyed it so much! No harm done!<br/>
