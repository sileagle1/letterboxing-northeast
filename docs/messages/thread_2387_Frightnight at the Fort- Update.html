will now be held at the Fort McClarey picnic area, which is right <br/>
down the street from Fort Foster on Route 103. Same day....October <br/>
22nd....new times...9-4. We're going to have many boxes, so we <br/>
thought we'd start a little earlier.<br/>
<br/>
Come one come all to Frightnight at the Fort. It's a day sure to be <br/>
filled with fun for all ages with special games, crafts and prizes. <br/>
This will be a potluck event, so please bring something to share. <br/>
There is a covered picnic area and bathrooms nearby. There are <br/>
plenty of boxes in the area, so plan to spend the day. We are going <br/>
to have quite a few event only boxes, so plan your day accordingly. <br/>
<br/>
There will be 2 costume contests at 2pm...one for kids and one for <br/>
adults with prizes awarded at 3pm.<br/>
<br/>
Please RSVP if possible either on Atlasquest or by e-mailing me at <br/>
oceanwytch at yahoo dot com.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there!<br/>
