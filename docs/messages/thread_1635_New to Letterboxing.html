<br/>
I discovered Letterboxing in the Cape Cod Times article.  I'm now <br/>
obsessed and I haven't even found my first letterbox yet!  I'm just <br/>
wondering before I go.....I will be letterboxing with my (almost) 20 <br/>
month old.  Any advice/help/hints to letterboxing with a little one?  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you &amp; looking forward to finding these treasures :)  <br/>

I have no great wisdom to impart about boxing with young ones (I <br/>
have boxed with 7-9 yr olds) that isn't the same sort of approach <br/>
you'd use for most any activity with them -- mostly be ready to <br/>
enjoy that kids change the pace -- sometimes slow things way down, <br/>
sometimes darting about like dragonflies. <br/>
<br/>
Don't expect to cover the same distances with a little one as you <br/>
would alone -- seems obvious, but you'd be surprised. I am sure you <br/>
are already toting all the requisite kid supplies, but just review <br/>
them with an eye to what might be handy during your jaunts in the <br/>
woods .... bug spray, sunscreen, water, etc depending on weather and <br/>
terrain.<br/>
<br/>
Many letterboxes are geared for adults, and even those aimed at <br/>
children are still a little much for a twenty-month old so make sure <br/>
there is plenty of time for joy and discovery and adventure for your <br/>
letterboxing companion who doesn't have the benefit yet of <br/>
unravelling a mystery along the way to a box.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!</div>
