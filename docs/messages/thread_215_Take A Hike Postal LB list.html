letterbox.  This time I made room for 100 letterboxers.  I thought I <br/>
would start to collect the addresses now since that takes the most <br/>
time getting this whole thing together.  I hope everyone who wants to <br/>
get this letterbox will cause I don't like leaving people out.  I <br/>
sent out the It Postal letterbox today for those of you who are on <br/>
that list to look forward too.  And just a reminder not to post your <br/>
address on the list.  Just e-mail it to me.  There are five people <br/>
that I have already e-mailed who wanted to be on the list for It who <br/>
did not make it and I already have those five written down.  So 95 <br/>
places left.  Hope to hear from many of you soon.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
