in the summer which makes letterboxing a special challenge as it's <br/>
hard to do both, so to those of you who plant with bike riders in <br/>
mind we send a heartfelt thank you. Sunshine you were right when you <br/>
said we wouldn't be satisfied with only 500, 1000 here we come!!!<br/>
Again, thank you all,<br/>

Tomorrow is the most important thing in life. Comes into us at midnight very clean. It's perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands. It hopes we've learned something from yesterday. <br/>
