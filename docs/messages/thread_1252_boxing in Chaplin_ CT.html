started off finding all ten of the Fairy Tale series, and the Fairy <br/>
of the Falls. I then found WWI Silent Night and the CT State Stamp <br/>
series-Windham County, which was my first find in that series. I then <br/>
traveled to get South Carolina and had Christmas Around the World. <br/>
And speaking of Christmas, I found The Best Christmas Pageant Ever <br/>
with the U.H.O. hitch hiker. I then went to Diana's pool and got Town <br/>
Crier with some Maple Falling Leaves and Molly's Day series. I ended <br/>
my day finding Knight &amp; Day. What a great way to spend part of a <br/>
holiday weekend! Hope yours was as successful as mine.<br/>
