Yes there are 51 boxes but there is no way you can get them all in one day just means that choices need to be made as to what ones they want to do ! If you do Holts hill there are so many things to enjoy that they will only get 12 in a few hours ( 4or 5 hours) Wonderful hike but well worth it !So when people get together its more about the social part of the day than the amount of boxes !Sorta like a mini gathering ! But i did put them in order so as to not waste time and gas !Been to there neck of the woods and got open arms so extending that thanks !<br/>
