this afternoon. "Itty Bitty" is a microbox--wow is it tiny. My stamp <br/>
in the logbook consists of smudged ear tips of my catstamp sig. The <br/>
eagle stamp is very detailed for such a small stamp. <br/>
  I drove to find the second stamp.  Headed along-side track. A dog <br/>
came trotting towards me down the tracks unattended so I turned and <br/>
left.  <br/>
  Went across the road and found Carolyn's "Watchful Eye" l.b. so it <br/>
was quite the eagle-ish day.<br/>
