This Sunday works well for us but next Sunday could be a little <br/>
tricky. What with all the other stuff going on. ;)<br/>
 As for Bluebird vouching for us...I don't know we've had our <br/>
problems in the past. It's hard to live up to the standards of one of <br/>
the nicest people you could ever meet. And get her together with <br/>
Butterfly, well how could anyone not but pale in comparison.<br/>
