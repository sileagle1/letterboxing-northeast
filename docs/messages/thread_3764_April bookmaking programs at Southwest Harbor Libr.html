some information about upcoming April programs/talks at the Southwest<br/>
Harbor Public Library (where I work.) One of our staff is involved in<br/>
a book and card making group/exchange and their work will be showcased<br/>
in the library along with several talks by some of the people involved.<br/>
<br/>
All events are at 7pm on Thursdays: On the 10th there will be a<br/>
workshop at on making artist's books; the 17th will be on a talk and<br/>
workshop on making pop-up books; and on the 24th will be a talk and<br/>
workshop with the members of book artists group.<br/>
<br/>
For more information contact the library at 207-244-7065.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
