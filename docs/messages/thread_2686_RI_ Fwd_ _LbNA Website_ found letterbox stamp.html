Message: <br/>
I notice you have a missing RI letterbox.  My son found a letterbox stamp last weekend on the shores of the Pettaquamscutt ("Narrow") River down there.  It shows two girls paddling a canoe -- lots of red ink.  Is this yours?  Do you know where/to whom it belongs?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Maya Howard<br/>

</span></blockquote>Well, I'll see what I can do. If the person who contacted me is<br/>
willing to mail it back then I'll clean it up and save it for a safe<br/>
return. Sure seems like this warrants an IALC get-together ;)<br/>
<br/>
I'll let you know how it turns out!<br/>
Thanks for the info.<br/>

GOOD NEWS! Maya kindly put the stamp in the mail to me and I received <br/>
it yesterday. Many thanks to Maya and her son for their generosity.<br/>
<br/>
I hope the rest of the series has remained and that the Girl Scouts <br/>
are still having fun finding them. <br/>
