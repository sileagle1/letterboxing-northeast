I went to the DEP in Marlborough today to find information about an unmarked trail off the Airline Trail.  During the conversation, I was told that the DEP is currently coming up with new policies on planting letterboxes in the State Parks.  I can only tell you what I was told - when the policies are completed the information will be posted to the DEP website - sometime this year.  They are considering that all boxes require a permit.  Any boxes without permits would be removed.  That's all I know, but thought I should disseminate the info to the group.  <br/>

&gt; Hi All!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I went to the DEP in Marlborough today to find information about an <br/>
unmarked trail off the Airline Trail. During the conversation, I was <br/>
told that the DEP is currently coming up with new policies on <br/>
planting letterboxes in the State Parks. I can only tell you what I <br/>
was told - when the policies are completed the information will be <br/>
posted to the DEP website - sometime this year. They are considering <br/>
that all boxes require a permit. Any boxes without permits would be <br/>
removed. That's all I know, but thought I should disseminate the info <br/>
to the group. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Enjoy!<br/>
