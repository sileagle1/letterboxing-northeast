two of the boxes that I had searched for two weeks ago are indeed <br/>
missing. Number 2 box of The Women of the Revolutionary War is MIA <br/>
and The Mary Lemist Titcomb box is also MIA. Music Woman was there to <br/>
help me find the number 3 box of When I was a girl in the Martin. I <br/>
still had the old clues. She also led me in the correct direction for <br/>
Stars and Stripes Forever, which has the incorrect degree reading. <br/>
Another group that she helped with is the Watership Downs series. I <br/>
could not find the yellow arrow, and was unsure as to which trail to <br/>
head out on, but she knew just where to look! I then followed her to <br/>
Caprilands and we both got that stamp. I should have asked her to <br/>
stay with me when searching for the Red Bird of the Red Bird and <br/>
Skungamaug River boxes. I looked all through the pricker bushes <br/>
(ouch!!!) and just could not find it, but did find the other one. But <br/>
between today and yesterday, I was able to find BenE, Eternal Love, <br/>
Kind of Corney, all 8 of the John Wayne Series, Presidential Animals, <br/>
Glass Factory, and If Wishes Were Horses. The only one with anything <br/>
to report about is Eternal Love: the stamp is in two pieces, but <br/>
still useable. I want to thank Music Woaman again for all her help <br/>
today! Could not have done it without you!!!<br/>
