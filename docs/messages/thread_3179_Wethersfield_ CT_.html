You are correct, it is a Christi production.   I corresponded with <br/>
her via e-mail a couple of times during the spring about her <br/>
letterbox, and she graciously gave me the clues.  Thanx Christi!  <br/>
(That was about the time I was planning to plant my "Red Onion" 'box <br/>
but had just learned of her original plant--it was mentioned in <br/>
another 'box's active, published clues.)  <br/>
I posted here or on the LbNA talklist asking if anyone knew the <br/>
placer of the original Red Onion LB, and thereafter she contacted <br/>
me.  I was hesitant to duplicate someone else's 'box but she told me <br/>
to plant.  (I still think her stamp is better than mine.  And mine <br/>
would have made a great hitchhiker starting out from her 'box! :p)<br/>
The long and short of it is that she has not had the time to check <br/>
on the 'box or repost the clues...and it is a beautiful stamp, too.<br/>
