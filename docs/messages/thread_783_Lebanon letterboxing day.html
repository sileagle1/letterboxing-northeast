headed to Lebanon, quite a letterboxing mecca, if I do say so! One <br/>
unexplored by me. I found Lebanon Loop (#4 of the series). If not for <br/>
letterboxing (specifically, Leader of the Pack) who would have known <br/>
this peaceful park existed?  Wasplanning to find the others in <br/>
series  today but, ah well. I shall return!<br/>
   "Ol' John Joseph's Railroad Yard Series" is highly recommended. <br/>
Pleasant hike-great bird watchng spot--clues are clear and stamps are <br/>
really well carved. <br/>
  I then headed to the "Castle of Scovell" series.  After stamping in <br/>
one stamp and trying to fit another, I realized a return visit with a <br/>
sheet of paper would have to be planned.  The stamps are certainly <br/>
well worth the visit. Just be wary. Houses are near by, plus people <br/>
park near the cemetary to go fishing at the nearby river.   <br/>
  Just a short jaunt today, but most enjoyable.  Then home to weed <br/>
the gardens and move some plants around. <br/>
