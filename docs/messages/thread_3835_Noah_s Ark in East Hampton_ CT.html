<br/>
  Mostly that box #7, Ladybugs, has been relocated due to some destruction in the area.<br/>
<br/>
  Also, box #10, Bunnies, and box #29, Doves, have completely disappeared <br/>
<br/>
  I was very saddened to see the area down by the river, yellow trail, so covered in trash. I really wish that I had had a garbage bag with me. Although I would have needed quite a few of them <br/>
<br/>
  On a happy note though, it is very nice that people are continuing to add to this series in "pairs". <br/>
<br/>
  PLEASE remember to be stealthy and to re-hide these boxes completely so that all of these wonderful boxes, by so many talented people, will be around for a long time to come for others to enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-85843101">~Great news. This series is all in place and ready for more finders. <br/>
<br/>
  My husband and I took our three pups out for a great hike to check all of the boxes, and of course a swim afterwards. We even met up with letterboxers from Maryland doing the series!!<br/>
<br/>
  The two boxes that were formerly listed as unavailable (Bunnies &amp; Doves) are now back. The Bunnies were re-carved by the original carver {CW Sun Seeker of UT} and the Doves were found after being dragged away by a critter quite a distance from their hiding spot by Donutz716. A big THANK YOU goes out to both letterboxers. <br/>
<br/>
  I was a little dismayed at how the boxes were hidden though. Most were visible, with the exception of the first few that the duo from Maryland had re-hidden. <br/>
<br/>
All of the boxes contents were double bagged originally, but most of the baggies were missing from the inside of the boxes. Where have all the baggies gone...?<br/>
<br/>
  PLEASE take the extra minute to make sure those contents are given the best chance of staying dry and that the boxes are completely covered so that others may have the fun of finding them.<br/>
<br/>
  I did read some wonderful comments in the log books and it seems that most everyone has truly enjoyed themselves doing this series. <br/>

  P.S. There have been some slight revisions to the clues too.<br/>
