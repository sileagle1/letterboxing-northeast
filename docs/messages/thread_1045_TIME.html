you imagine the amount of responsibility that goes along with that <br/>
kind of fame?  First of all, you have to carry a magazine everywhere <br/>
with you, then there are the autographs and bothersome groupies, the <br/>
paparazzi...the list goes on.  Poor Lori is forced to carry 20 extra <br/>
copies in case Brian's gets wet.  You all know he's going to frame <br/>
that thing.  After all, it was the "SOCIETY" section.  I wonder if <br/>
he can make frames as well as he carves stmps?  Lori, you're a saint.<br/>
Solor and Binx know what I'm talking about...feel free to chime in <br/>
guys.  In closing, Brian and Lori will have an autograph booth at <br/>
the 4H gathering in August.   Don't have a copy, you say?  Fear not! <br/>
Brian will be topping off the trunk before they leave.  A sharpie <br/>
will be provided as well.  <br/>

Maine was great. <br/>
