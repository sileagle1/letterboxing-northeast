nickerson on Cape Cod.  I have a question, We are planning a camping <br/>
trip for July and would like to try Nickerson ( I used to camp there <br/>
MANY years ago!)<br/>
<br/>
Can any one suggest a good area and/or site.  We have a pop up <br/>
camper and would prefer something more wooded and a little less <br/>
crowded.  Please be as specific as possible it's a big place!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
