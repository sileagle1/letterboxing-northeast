that article available in your clues.  That way everyone can make up their<br/>

since there are so many families that letterbox and so many letterboxing<br/>

to be made aware.  It may discourage some people.  I think that's ok....you<br/>

I'm a single dad and I would feel very uneasy bringing my kids out to find this box. <br/>
Frankly, I don't care what these guys do there, but I don't want to be involved, and I <br/>
certainly wouldn't want my kids seeing any of it. I just don't think a known "anonymous <br/>
sex park" is a place many people, especially families, will feel comfortable letterboxing.<br/>

great trails.  Saw lots of people running, walking their dogs, etc. <br/>
located behind a nursing home. Planted a small series there.<br/>
<br/>
Little did I know that not only did this park have a draw for people <br/>
to engage in anonymous sex, it also drew the druggies and people with <br/>
nothing better to do than create mischief and mayhem.<br/>
<br/>
My boxes were quickly muggled (you needed to have the clues to know <br/>
where they were- they weren't visible from the trail). The stamps <br/>
were stolen, boxes filled with leaves or thrown aside. <br/>
<br/>
 At one box I found a bag with a pair of jeans in it, a newspaper, a <br/>
tag from a dog and a picture of a guy showing what he was most proud <br/>
of (if you get my drift).  Now my husband didn't believe me, but Miss <br/>
Prisspott found the same thing earlier.<br/>
<br/>
I've also found used condoms and "toys" (ahem), along with drug <br/>
paraphenalia.  At that point it's becoming a public health issue and <br/>
has nothing to do with people's personal sexual choices which have <br/>
never been my concern nor have I had the least interest in.<br/>
<br/>
I pulled the boxes, pulled the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Another new letterboxing family in my area planted a box in the same <br/>
park recently.  After a short period it was "adopted" by a group of <br/>
kids who apparently gather there to do drugs.  This box is well off <br/>
the trail and well hidden. You wouldn't know it was there without the <br/>
clues.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, there is too much of an opportunity at this point of coming <br/>
upon something I don't care to see in this park, so I no longer <br/>
visit.  Too bad, it could be a great park.<br/>
<br/>
I'd pull them if I were you.  It's just to risky for someone to come <br/>
upon<br/>
