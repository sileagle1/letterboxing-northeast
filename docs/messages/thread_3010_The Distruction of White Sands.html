I'll never understand why people do that - apparently they can't see they are hurting themselves as well as everyone else.<br/>

Keep your chin up - you did make a difference and the fact that you care speaks volumes.<br/>

</span></blockquote>I hear you loud and clear.  I know of other places that are beautiful and <br/>
isolated that have become "off limits" because of the hangout syndrome.  The <br/>
solution is for the site to become more heavily used by legits.  If folks find <br/>
that they are intimidated or are putting themselves at risk, it makes sense to me <br/>
that law enforcement, forestry, and decent folks need to follow your fine <br/>
example, maintain the area and increase the traffic.  Someone earlier posted that <br/>
they are not good looking etc but that younger, more attractive people might <br/>
be in jeopardy--that is not the way sick minds work.  Looks don't matter and <br/>
age doesn't either.  Gender might not matter either.  If someone is sensing <br/>
danger, we all ought to take care of ourselves and then, take care of the <br/>
problem.  <br/>
<br/>
My family has been going to a waterfall in Maine for 60 years or more and <br/>
starting with my father, we plan to leave it better than we found it.  We take <br/>
trashbags and fill them with BW cans and other unpleasant litter.  We have not <br/>
prevented the parties, but we leave it beautiful for the next folks 3 or 4 <br/>
times each summer.  Recently, I was pleased to hear that my half-brother's stepson <br/>
and his family are also carrying on this tradition.  So then it's more like 8 <br/>
summer cleanup visits.  It's like we adopted this one spot.  We care about <br/>
all the pretty places and we clean as we go, but this waterfall is a special <br/>
place.  As long as we can get there,  we will continue.  Wouldn't it be great if <br/>
places could be up for adoption by families, clubs and other groups like <br/>
letterboxes can be adopted?  Last year, the wheeler group that I belong to got a <br/>
grant to clean up a piece of wild land that had become a car dump.  It was very <br/>
satisfying to see the land cleaned up.  I wonder if we could petition judges <br/>
to assign some of these places as public service alternative sentencing <br/>
options?  Hmmm.  The picnic area, the end of Northstreet, Riverbank Park,  mile 73 of <br/>
the interstate....<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and be hopeful--stewardship is an aspect of character that <br/>
developes from your example.<br/>
