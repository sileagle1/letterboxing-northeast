Rustypuff picked up The Case of the Missing Mascot and the Weezil<br/>
series. All are in place and intact, although Weezil boxes #1 and #2<br/>
both contained a small amount of water.<br/>
<br/>
20040229:<br/>
At the POE gathering, we stamped into the Mountain High and Little<br/>
Acorns of Happiness postal letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
At the event hostel, we left the Pusmobile HH and took Buddy's Bug HH.<br/>
<br/>
Rustypuff and I gang-boxed with several other boxers to find CrAzY<br/>
cAtErPiLlAr &amp; bIzArRe BeAtLe, both in place, dry, and intact.<br/>
<br/>
Ship's Log, which we received from Wanda &amp; Pete on 20031221, was<br/>
delivered into the hands of another deserving 'boxer.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all involved in the POE gathering.  These things just get<br/>
better and better!<br/>
<br/>
Next up: Maine.<br/>
