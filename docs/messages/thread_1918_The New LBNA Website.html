<br/>
Now that I can do that on LBNA.... the obsession becomes GREATER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Not to mention that with 2600+ finds.....  It will take me FOREVER!<br/>
<br/>
Now.... if LBNA can get the ones that I've already found to "hide" like they do on atlasquest.... (hint hint.... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the great addition to the website!  Now I need to get wireless broadband so I can update my logbook at school, at rehearsal, ..... who needs time to work when there's so much letterboxing work to be done!!!!<br/>
