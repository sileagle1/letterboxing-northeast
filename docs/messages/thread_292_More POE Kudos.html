<br/>
Sue and I had a wonderful day at Farmer Harvey's today. The weather <br/>
was mild, the boxers the best, and the exchanges and HH were <br/>
plentiful!<br/>
<br/>
Special thanks to Warrior Woman for arranging such a special day, <br/>
Brian from TGD for carving not only 1 fantastic Event Stamp for POE <br/>
but the second after-gathering "Sadie Hawkins" Event Stamp for <br/>
Tweed's Restaurant. By the way, for any of you that couldn't figure <br/>
out the "Eik was Danish" clue - it was an anagram for "Sadie Hawkins."<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Phyto for the felt pouch demo, to all of the boxers with <br/>
personal travelers, all of those that brought HH to share in the HH <br/>
Hostel and everyone who brought the delicious food.<br/>
<br/>
Also the after gathering meal at Tweed's was time for all of us <br/>
hardcore boxers to gossip and eat. Thanks to all who attended.<br/>
<br/>
It was surely a day to remember and to . . . . .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there and box!!!<br/>
<br/>
