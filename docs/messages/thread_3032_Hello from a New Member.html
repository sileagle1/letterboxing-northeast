I just started letterboxing this spring, so I'm very new to the hobby<br/>
(I think I'm up to a whopping 13 found).  Most of the time I'm bumming<br/>
around UNH, pretending to work on my MS thesis when I'm instead<br/>
perusing letterbox clues and wishing I were anywhere but at work.  <br/>
<br/>
This past weekend, I camped with a bunch of friends up at Moose Brook<br/>
State Park, and got the (brand-new: I was the first!) letterbox at<br/>
Crystal Cascades on my way up Mt. Washington on Saturday.  It took me<br/>
6 hours, but I  made it to the top (my first attempt on this mountain,<br/>
plus I'm woefully out of shape) via Tuckerman Ravine and back down<br/>
over the Lion's Head, taking another 3 hours to get back down.  My<br/>
friends all hike a lot faster than I do, so I was pretty much alone<br/>
from the base of the ravine headwall up to the summit and the entire<br/>
way back down.<br/>
<br/>
I am so very very sore today!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-159423537">I was thinking that myself, on my trip back down.  It was starting to<br/>
get late into the afternoon (I hit the summit at 3:40 and started back<br/>
down at 3:50!) and I was hurrying because I didn't want to still be on<br/>
the mountain when it started to get dark - but I didn't want to hurry<br/>
to much in case I tripped and injured myself!  As I came out the<br/>
bottom, I met up with them, "just" on their way back up to start<br/>
looking for me.<br/>
<br/>
I've done other hikes by myself - but they have all been much smaller,<br/>
as when I did Mt. Major to snag the Compass Rose letterbox :)  So I do<br/>
have some confidence in my abilities to take care of myself - but it's<br/>
a pretty big difference between Mt. Major and Mt. Washington, both in<br/>
size and in the number of people you're likely to meet on the trail!<br/>
