October 4rth.<br/>
Update by Hawkwind and Mienu:<br/>
"Where the Sidewalk Ends" and "Berenstain Bears" will need new log<br/>
books soon.<br/>
Poor Pinocchio was left out in the open without his lid! His logbook<br/>
was completely soaked and ruined. We have it and will try to replace<br/>
it in a couple weeks. <br/>
(I will be in Maine for the weekend, so I am not sure when I can get<br/>
back to replace the log book.)<br/>
We found the "Witch Craft" H.H.(left by the Bigelow Hollow Staff) at<br/>
the "Very Hungry Caterpillar" After some coaxing on "Witch Crafts"<br/>
part Hawkwind was convinced to bring her along on one of her trips<br/>
north or northwest.<br/>
"The Lorax" is in need of new Marvy Markers. We found "The Bunny Hop"<br/>
H.H. at "Is Your Momma a Llama?" and after realizing that she has been<br/>
waiting patiently for quiet a while for a lift Hawkwind and Mienu<br/>
remembered a lovely spot in the north east that she will like. She is<br/>
safely residing with Hawkwind until her move in the near future.<br/>
Poor Eeyore from "Winnie the Pooh!" The forestry workers have been all<br/>
around his house! But he is safe and so is his house! Poor "Misty" on<br/>
the other hand has had part of her trail along the lookout wash out<br/>
and the going is very tricky, but she is still resting safely with the<br/>
rest of the ponies.<br/>
"Where The Wild Things Are" will need a new green stamp and there is a<br/>
large tree across the trail on the way to our visit with "Ferdinand",<br/>
but he is also safe.  We enjoyed our "Green Eggs and Ham" and were<br/>
very tickled to find "Horton Hears a Who" or actually he heard us!<br/>
"Stega Nona" has also had some forestry work going on in her area and<br/>
other than the need for an orange ink pad she is safe and happy. <br/>
We were absolutely taken with "The Cheshire Cat", he had the most<br/>
wonderful logbook we have ever seen!<br/>
Poor, poor "Alexander and the Horrible, Terrible Rotten Day"! His area<br/>
has been trampled a bit by the workers also and the tree with 4 blue<br/>
spots on the way to "The Secret Garden" is missing, again a causualty<br/>
of the forest workers.<br/>
The lamp post to "The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe" was safe and<br/>
sound and burning brightly.It was rather strange to see a "Fish Out of<br/>
Water"..but he was happy as could be so we wandered on to visit "Mrs<br/>
Rumphius" and her beautiful flowers. There has also been some forestry<br/>
work done in her area but she is also safe. Lastly we stopped to rest<br/>
with "The Nights of The Round Table" the night on guard will need to<br/>
have his armour polished with some new gold ink, but he is doing well.<br/>
(Will be sending out a SAS postcard to the guardian of the box.)<br/>
We replaced quite a few bags that were worn out as well as a couple<br/>
'blotters'. There is a need for new log books soon as well as more<br/>
bags and ink pads. <br/>
All in all a wonderful day of LBing!</div>
