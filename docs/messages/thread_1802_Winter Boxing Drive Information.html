excited?)!!!<br/>
<br/>
The projected date is Sunday, February 27.   Looking at my schedule, that <br/>
seems to be the only weekend day I'm free, between family stuff and rehearsals <br/>
(I'm in another play... and there will probably be a box there just like there <br/>
was for Drood).<br/>
<br/>
We'll be doing this one in Lebanon.  I've planned a lot of boxes, just like <br/>
last time.  However, since they're all in one town, we'll be spending a lot <br/>
less time driving from box to box.  Here's the route, in case you want to print <br/>
the clues:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Sunny Days series (pending how much snow there is on the ground).  There <br/>
are 9 in this series, but it still adds up to a pretty short walk.<br/>
2.  Pioneers in Lebanon<br/>
3.  Gray Goose in the Town Pound<br/>
4.  Hidden Cemetery series/Baby D Turns 2 (same location)<br/>
5.  Baby D turns 1<br/>
6.  Red Brick Meetinghouse/Jonathan Trumbull Library (first in Lebanon Loop <br/>
series) (same location)<br/>
7.  Tymfurkoffi!<br/>
8.  Local Heroes<br/>
9.  A Night on Lebanon Green<br/>
10.  My First Love<br/>
11.  Pot O' Gold<br/>
12.  Lebanon Loop 2<br/>
13.  Lebanon Loop 3<br/>
14.  Lebanon Loop 4/Bear Tracks (same park)<br/>
15.  Castle Scovell series<br/>
16.  Gray of Liberty Hill<br/>
17.  Lebanon Lions<br/>
<br/>
Whew...  <br/>
<br/>
Soon I'll send out a list of box-to-box directions for everyone to print, but <br/>
first I'm going to email it to Flutterby, since this is her hometown, so she <br/>
can check it for accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
More details to follow!<br/>

</span></blockquote>OK, so I forgot to do this.  Sorry guys.  I'll do it before Sunday, though, and bring several copies.  It shouldn't be tough.  It's not a huge area.  And I have a map of Lebanon that I can make a couple of copies of too.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if I'll be able to check my email between now and Sunday morning (going to MA for my little sister's birthday) so if anyone has anything urgent to ask, Flutterby has my cell phone number.  She can give it to you. :)  I *think* Stacy of the MayDay Lilies has it too, from the cast list of Once Upon a Mattress?  So you can ask them to give it to you.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, I'll see you at 9 am at Bartlett Brook.  Can't wait!  :)<br/>
