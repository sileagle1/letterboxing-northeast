<br/>
My 12 year old son (Dune Dude) had a half day off from school about a <br/>
week ago, so we decided to go out and grab a box or two.  This is a <br/>
weekday (Wednesday I think), during the day, around 12 noon.  We head <br/>
to the Bellingham/Franklin area.<br/>
<br/>
We went to find Sand Dollars and Sense (which, ironically for you, <br/>
had a HH in it).  It looks like practically a drive-by, in the middle <br/>
of a commercial/residential area.<br/>
<br/>
Now this location is a nice spot, not a hunting area at all.  But do <br/>
I trust that everyone follows the rules about hunting?  No way.  I <br/>
don my blaze orange, and make my son do the same.  Don't we look <br/>
ridiculous walking around a fishing pond with blaze orange on!<br/>
<br/>
We find the box, stamp in, start chasing each other around the field -<br/>
 and gunfire erupts.  Having had a lot of firearms training, I *know* <br/>
this is not hunting rifle fire.  This is someone shooting a semi-<br/>
automatic at a target.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, my son also knows the rules about firearms.  He drops to <br/>
the ground (as did I).  The semi keeps firing in bursts.  During a <br/>
lull, I screamed out "CEASE FIRE!  CEASE FIRE!".  Fortunately, <br/>
whoever was doing target practice in their back yard with a Glock (or <br/>
whatever) heard me and stopped firing.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, this scared the living s**t out of my son, who now <br/>
REFUSES to go letterboxing with me, after being my trusty companion <br/>
for two years now.  I can't say I blame him, and now I am a little <br/>
skittish myself.<br/>
<br/>
It was a Murphy's law day for us - BIG time!<br/>
<br/>
However ....<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to finding your next Millis box (I think I have <br/>
the first four already) - whenever you *do* find your clues and post <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
And you bet I'll be wearing blaze orange, too.<br/>

more stamps and went out last night and planted two boxes (with a 3rd<br/>
waiting!).  :-)   Historic Millis #5 (for which I went out and re-figured my<br/>
clues, and then later found my orig. clue sheet on the bathroom floor..silly<br/>
me, I searched the car, not the bathroom) and Mr. Ranger, sir!  Are both out<br/>
there.  :-)    Had fun playing with my #1 blade.<br/>

I think we're heading to Franklin to box today.  :-)<br/>
