<br/>
I do, however, have to caution you to do the red trail loop in a counter clockwise fashion and to head back the same way. The field of nettles is very high and unforgiving as of this evening!!! Poor Baby D had to be carried through it and  Doodles and Reilly were trying to walk without having their feet touch the ground. Other than the fact that it was a bit painful (to me as well in shorts) it was actually rather comical watching it. At least my husband was smart enough to wear long pants and boots!!<br/>
<br/>
Because it was placed a week late, it will remain out longer than usual. I will be pulling this box early in the morning on September 29th. <br/>
