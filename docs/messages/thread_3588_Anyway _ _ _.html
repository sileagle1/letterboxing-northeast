we change the subject of the board and not give them another word one<br/>
way or the other HERE.So what kind of projects has everyone been<br/>
working on recently?I'd love to hear what your summer pursuits have<br/>
been.I have been involved in a group Tarawatch.org trying to Save the<br/>
Hill of Tara in Ireland from destruction.I may even be going out there<br/>
to stand in front of bulldozers in about a month when I get my<br/>
passport.I found out about this amazing piece of history when I sent 5<br/>
boxes to Ireland to be planted a couple years ago.Illia planted them<br/>
there and the clues take you from a Fairy Tree,intrigued, I googled<br/>
the Hill and was brought close to tears that a small piece of me was<br/>
in a place so stunningly beautiful and full of magic.That is when I<br/>
found out about the proposed M3 Motorway and the fact that it would<br/>
run dangerously close to the Hill thus destroying any<br/>
monuments,walls,henges,etc. that got in the way.The fight has been<br/>
going on since 2003 and we are very close to losing now thanks to the<br/>
treacherous Ex-minister of the environment Dick Roche so properly<br/>
named is he!He gave the ok to destroy Lismullen Henge which was<br/>
unearthed not far from Tara during construction and refusing to force<br/>
the construction crew to re-route.After having sworn to protect Tara<br/>
during his election campaign.It's on the list of the top 100 most<br/>
endangered sites as is Stonehenge.They continue to try and sell out<br/>
our Heritage to the highest bidder and I for one am very angry!If<br/>
you'de care to help check out    tarawatch.org <br/>
or thier Yahoo group       <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hilloftara/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hilloftara/</a> <br/>

left in their place asking that messages filled with hate be sent to a <br/>
provided email address.  I expect that the requested responses were a big <br/>
part of the thrill or whatever.  I do not doubt that the thief iis enjoying <br/>
reading these posts.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just had a blast this weekend at the Come Fly a Kite Gathering in <br/>
Cape Elizabeth, ME.  Some of the boxes in that area were missing, some <br/>
apparently only temporarily.  130 people sat around with each other, meeting <br/>
and chatting.  I didn't see more than half a dozen people actually boxing <br/>
that day (Wanda was one, of course.)<br/>
