<br/>
Back in December when Ice Scream Sunday first came into being,<br/>
oldpatterns and I had never been to an event, and Team Randalstik was<br/>
the weathered veteran with one under his belt.  Saying we really<br/>
didn't know what we were getting into was a bit of an understatement.<br/>
<br/>
But when we finally went "public" with the event, we were immediately <br/>
overwhelmed by all the positive feedback, helpful advice and requests<br/>
to lend a hand.  And it just got better.<br/>
<br/>
When the day finally came, it was truly amazing to see so many<br/>
letterboxers in one place, ready to stamp, exchange and box their<br/>
hearts out, in spite of the fickle weather.  I was happy to finally be<br/>
able to put some faces to names, and I missed many.  The barn was full<br/>
of goodwill, and the generosity of the group was clearly apparent with<br/>
all the bountiful potluck food and ice-cream paraphernalia brought by<br/>
attendees.<br/>
<br/>
What a great hobby.<br/>
<br/>
We'd like to give special thanks to Warrior Woman, Orion,<br/>
VickieandLundster, J.E.S.S., CPAScott and the Lazy Letterboxer for all<br/>
their help and support.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to acknowledge oldpatterns for all her hard work coordinating<br/>
the event, and Team Randalstik for his amazing work as stamp/Zine boy.<br/>
<br/>
I do have one complaint however - ok, maybe two.  Yes, the weather<br/>
could have been nicer.  And the people attending the event could have<br/>
eaten more ice-cream!  I now have approximately 2 gallons of cookies<br/>
'n cream in my freezer - this is not a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
But otherwise, myself, oldpatterns and Team Randalstick were very<br/>
happy to host you all.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

for team Randalstik). I hope you were able to feel like guests at your own event. And I can <br/>
relate to complaint #2-I still have a big jar of praline sauce in the fridge but the family <br/>
doesn't seem to mind! <br/>
<br/>
Take care, Orion<br/>
who would've thought you were all old pros!<br/>

There's always a conflict when something cool gets planned. As for weather, it rained, snowed, and sleeted on us when we drove out to Tahoe, but we were psyched about being there, just like all your attendees were happy to be *there*.   Wish we could've been there!  Maybe you could do this again...  sometime. Or we could come over your house and help you out with that ice cream problem. :-)  &lt;LOL! As if we need it after all the chocolate we've been eating and all the food we were *forced* to eat in CA&gt;  Sounds like you had a great gathering, anyway.<br/>
