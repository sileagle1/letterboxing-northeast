<br/>
Please avoid this box for a while. We've received some reports and <br/>
are in the process of re-tooling the location for this box.   We've <br/>
come to question how safe it is to cross this road and don't want <br/>
anyone to get hurt. We'll re-post as soon as OSHA approves the new <br/>
spot (grin)! <br/>
<br/>
Also....If our email has been spamming anyone with bogus mail, drop <br/>
us a line. I think we're getting spammed saying that we're spamming <br/>
people... but who knows!  <br/>
