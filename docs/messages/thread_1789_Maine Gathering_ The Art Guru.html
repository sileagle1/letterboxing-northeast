I feel compelled to make a comment here. I follow Mark Pepe's page religiously and <br/>
noticed that there is a carving contest as part of the planned Art Guru festivities. I am <br/>
pleased that it isn't humanly possible for me to be there since I'm on the left coast. <br/>
With the likes of Legerdemaine, TeamGreenDragon, Jay Drew, Phyto, etc. I would feel <br/>
totally outclassed by the potential carving talent in attendance. <br/>
<br/>
I do hope that newbies and those with less time to devote or more modest skills with <br/>
their carving tools aren't discouraged by this. I would never want one of my stamps to <br/>
be judged against another letterboxer's. I hope that the only person I ever have to <br/>
compete against in this arena is myself. As time goes by, my carvings get better and <br/>
better but I don't think I'll ever be as masterful as some... Peace, Funhog<br/>

dumbfounded by the the creativity of the subject matter at hand. One<br/>
of the many reasons that I love this state of Maine is because of the<br/>
community of people that I always find so open to the idea of peace<br/>
and harmony. As I work towards my own personal goals of awareness<br/>
aligned with the practice of Buddhism, I always find support in the<br/>
people and nature that surrounds me in this beautiful state.<br/>

I am writing to try to explain the purpose behind this "Contest"  If there was a <br/>
better word to use I would but I did not want it to be a competition.  What it is <br/>
all about is a group of people working for an important cause.  I know it <br/>
sounds silly that acrving a stamp with this theme can have an impact but the <br/>
power of postive thought in every carving will make a difference.  I was even <br/>
hoping that people would plant them in there area after so all the other <br/>
letterboxers that go and visit that box will be blessed with that good peace of <br/>
mind.  When I vote at the gathering I wont be looking for the best carving skills <br/>
but the carving that means the most to me.<br/>
<br/>
It was wrong of me to keep the list only open to people coming to the <br/>
gathering.  My only reasons behind it were that of the postage cost of mailing <br/>
everyones art copies back.  If you wish to join in the experince and are willing <br/>
to mail a few dollars along with your art work I would be happy to mail you <br/>
back the collection of art work if you are unable to attend the gathering.<br/>
<br/>
With that all said there is only a few more days to sign up.  Please e-mail me <br/>
off list if you are interested and for more details go to Mark and Sue Pepes <br/>
web page.<br/>
