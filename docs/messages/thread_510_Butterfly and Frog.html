&gt;Well start off by coming to the May 2nd gathering at Quaddick State Park in Thompson so we can meet and get to know one another and we'll go from there.I know the Northeast corner of our fine State like the back of my hand, and I don't mine giving a tour now and then.The most stamps that I helped people find in one day is 56, but I like braking records lol.But keep in mine...that's not what letterboxing is all about and it might take all the fun out of it if you run through it instead of enjoying the walk.Lenny...NeeDeep </span></blockquote></div>

Are you accepting any more additions?  We'd like to hitch onto that <br/>
tour...hahaha...and I doubt we'd be doing 56 boxes (read my post on <br/>
SGSP mini...explains it all)...<br/>
