Just wondering if anyone could let me know of boxes that they recently found or were MIA.  Clues to any unpublished boxes would be welcome as well.  It has been far too long since we've gotten out and we are anxious to find some hidden treasures.<br/>

cracked) and if anyone would be able to fix that for me I'd be eternally grateful.  <br/>
Anyway, it's called The Weight of Water, and it's been pretty popular.  I just <br/>
got a report on it the other day so I'm sure it's still there.  :)<br/>

I found Susie Sells Sea Shells in August and it was also in good shape.  :)</div>

We found the following boxes (apparently last finders) before the  winter:<br/>
<br/>
Susie Sells Seashells - Good Condition with a cute story behind it when you  <br/>
find it.<br/>
<br/>
Treaty of Portsmouth - Orion said in an earlier email that it got buried  <br/>
under a landslide and will be replaced elsewhere in the future. It's too bad  <br/>
because it is a very nice walk in a beautiful area.<br/>
<br/>
Live Free or Die - Good Condition and I think it is one of the most  visited. <br/>
It is in a very cool area. The logbook is full. Bring an index card or  <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
If you have time and energy there are a few in Kittery, ME that are in  great <br/>
areas and are worth seeking.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>

able to hit.  The kids enjoy letterboxing but aren't number driven <br/>
and really enjoy exploring the different locations.  We will bring <br/>
extra supplies so we can replace boxes, logbooks or bags if we find <br/>
any in need of repair.  Now I just need the weather to cooperated.  <br/>
