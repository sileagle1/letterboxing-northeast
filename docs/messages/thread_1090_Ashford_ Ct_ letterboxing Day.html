with weeds{{cough! cough!)) I escaped for an afternoon of boxing. <br/>
First stop: Ashford's Nipmuck Picture This l.b.  It sure had me <br/>
studying the unique rock formations of our N.E. forests. (Chuck, box <br/>
was very wet inside, but not cracked.  I dried and rebagged <br/>
everything. No harm done.) On to Nipmuck Trail l.b. Very nice hiding <br/>
spot, though I kept thinking of the hiker recently bitten by a snake <br/>
on Bear Mt. Poking sticks are our friends. Heard, then saw a black <br/>
snake on my way out. <br/>
  On to "Rain/Sleet/Snow"..I thought! that's the trouble with <br/>
printing double-sided clue sheets. I meant to get R.S.S. but followed <br/>
the clues to :Once Was Mine" by mistake. Thought that 3/4 mile <br/>
description was not feeling right..  Nope, did not bring Boston <br/>
Hollow clues but do plan on a return this fall if not sooner with <br/>
husband and picnic lunch in tow. What a pristine view!<br/>
  Ran out of time to do any more Ashford boxes today, but am eager to <br/>
return for more. I hiked on parts of the Nipmuck Trail I'd never seen <br/>
before and it was lovely (and cool).<br/>
