I have lived right next to a National Park for over 35 and I have seen the destruction that has been caused by millions of people going off the marked park trails.  Erosion has become a huge problem because vegetation has been destroyed.  Even trees have been damaged by people wearing down the soil around their roots.

 places to hide boxes that don't run the risk of pushing people to break rules.  And if a place like that can't be found, then perhaps the park isn't the place to plant a box.  Many of our parks are in very fragile condition.  As public lands shrink, more people are using the parks and the negative impact is huge.  Let's not let letterboxing add to that.<br/>

Drew Family and the logbook contained a couple entries by the local <br/>
park rangers.  They were positive, and commended the placer for <br/>
including warnings about being environmentally sensitive in hunting <br/>
the boxes.  That particular box has been in place for many years.  It <br/>
didn't look like anyone had found it accidentally, which is saying <br/>
something as it is in a popular area on the most climbed mountain in <br/>
the world.  It's all comes down to good placement! :)<br/>

is  the potential of damaging fragile areas. I'm sensitive to this <br/>
when boxing and placing on Cape Cod. My main concern, in general, is <br/>
neglected boxes.  A neglected letterbox is  a piece of  non-<br/>
biodegradable plastic. We all do our part to repair boxes in need of <br/>
care, but what about the e-mails sent to placers who do not respond?<br/>
I'm willing to adopt but not sure of process. (Red Hat letterbox in <br/>
Marlborough, is one case in mind).<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1722442494">Please, please do not put boxes off trail on mountains! By doing so, <br/>
you encourage people to create new "trails" that cause erosion and <br/>
cause plants and trees (some endangered and protected) to suffer damage <br/>
and even die. Erosion also contributes to mud slides, change in <br/>
weather, and horrible trail conditions. <br/>
<br/>
Also, above tree line is the alpine zone where plants can sustain <br/>
incredible damage just by being walked on once. Those plants are trying <br/>
to survive in that harsh environment and don't need boxers tramping <br/>
over them to get to a box. <br/>
<br/>
I agree with the others. If there isn't a suitable spot right next to <br/>
the trail, you should be placing the box on that trail no matter how <br/>
cool or "perfect" the spot might be for your stamp.<br/>
