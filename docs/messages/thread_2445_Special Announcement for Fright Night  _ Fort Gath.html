the organizers would like to announce that at the event there will <br/>
be 2 costume contests...<br/>
<br/>
One for the Kids, and one for the adults<br/>
<br/>
Both contests will begin at 2 PM. This is to allow people to be able <br/>
to change into costumes &amp; back to regular wear for boxing &amp; other <br/>
surprises.<br/>
<br/>
For the kids the Grand prize will be a Build a Bear specially themed <br/>
for Halloween. There will be other prizes as well!!!<br/>
<br/>
For the adults we have just added another category for the contest.<br/>
A special prize will be given to the costume MOST resembling a <br/>
LETTERBOXING TRAIL NAME ( hopefully other than your own)! This is <br/>
meant as a fun creative twist on traditional costume contests...<br/>
<br/>
Remember that costumes can make great hiding spots for boxes:)<br/>
<br/>
Some more surprises may be leaked out shortly. We hope anyone <br/>
considering coming will email myself or oceanwytch on yahoo. We also <br/>
have RSVP list set up on atlasquest.....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks <br/>
