<br/>
Lately a lot of your messages have been getting flagged as spam.<br/>
I'm not sure why this is unless Yahoo has made some kind of upgrade <br/>
to it's filters.<br/>
<br/>
As an example Chuck's latest message ended up in the spam folder. <br/>
Although I don't see anything different about it than any other <br/>
message Chuck has posted in the past.<br/>
<br/>
Since I don't get notified when something is flagged as spam it might <br/>
take me a little while to aprove the post. I do check here on a daily <br/>
basis so if a message doesn't show up right away it will be just a <br/>
short time before it will.<br/>
<br/>
Of course if you post something and it doesn't show up after what you <br/>
consider to be a reasonable amount of time shoot me an email and I'll <br/>
look into it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

of spam by suddenly adjusting their filter rules.  It will block the <br/>
spam, but sometimes legitimate messages get caught also.  I have <br/>
heard of this happening with many ISP's, etc.  Sometimes they will <br/>
adjust them back when the wave is over, and sometimes not.<br/>
