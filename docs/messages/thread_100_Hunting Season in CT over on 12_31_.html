Has anyone else checked out the regs and does that seem right?<br/>

include shot guns, but I'm not sure.  I have a good friend who's bummed since <br/>
he hasn't shot a deer yet this year, and is under the wire.  Thank goodness <br/>
he's off from work this week, so he can go out every day until the New Year!<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-618652739">Deanne, I read the CT regs that Heidi and Steve sent. It says 12/31 is the end of deer hunting in CT.  Small game hunting continues, <br/>
though--for some animals until end of Feb.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I wouldn't discourage anyone from going, but I think I myself will wait for a pretty spring day when everything's green and <br/>
wildflowers are blooming and hunting season is long past. A nice weekend day when you are likely to run into other letterboxers would <br/>
be ideal!<br/>

link we sent and pull it up.  I know for a fact that waterfowl <br/>
continues on into January. I'm not a deer hunter so I don't pay much <br/>
attention to that side of the sport.   Frequently the small game <br/>

Spring Turkey season also!<br/>
