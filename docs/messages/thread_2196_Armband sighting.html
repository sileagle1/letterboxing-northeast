your point of view, but I SWEAR we saw someone wearing one of the <br/>
Pepe's Just Get Out There and Box wristbands this weekend. We were <br/>
driving southbound on I-91 around Brattleboro in southern Vermont on <br/>
Saturday when a red Cherokee whizzed by. The passenger was waving her <br/>
arm out the window in the evening breeze with a nice manicure and that <br/>
distinctive wristband. Anyone on the list?<br/>

</span></blockquote>We saw that the Trustees of the Reservation in Mass are selling <br/>
wristbands for their organization that are the same color as the <br/>
boxing bands, and I'll bet that there are lots of others out there in <br/>
the same green color.<br/>

Now, if anyone sees a new blue Scion Xb festooned with letterboxing <br/>
bumper stickers on the back, you can be pretty darn sure that you've <br/>
spotted Silent Doug or Clueless!<br/>
