The "Dyslexic Queen" letterbox, a part of the Octopus placement has <br/>
been upgraded to a Hitchhiker Hostel.  The rules do not match those of <br/>
the Christmas Spirit Hostel across the street.  This is a large hostel <br/>
and can accomodate boxed hitchhikers.  It has 1 HH now.<br/>
<br/>
Plese follow these Hostel Rules to increase fun for everyone<br/>
<br/>
1. There should always be at least one hitchhiker in residence.<br/>
<br/>
2. If you take a hitchhiker, you should leave a hitchhiker.<br/>
<br/>
3. Exception to rule one: If you arrive with no hitchhikers, and there <br/>
is more than one hitchhiker in the hostel; you may take one hitchhiker <br/>
without leaving one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Christmas Spirit Hostel was a refuge for hitchhikers over the <br/>
winter.  It needed to retain its hitchhikers so that people who donated <br/>
one could reclaim one in exchange later, if they desired.<br/>
<br/>
The new hostel's rules are meant to promote hitchhiker travel, and <br/>
thereby fun.<br/>
<br/>
Hitchhiker Etiquette 101<br/>
1.  The hitchhiker you leave should be stamped into the hostel logbook <br/>
when you leave it.  The Hostel stamp should be in the hitchhiker log.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Record any hitchhikers you take or leave, in the hostel logbook.<br/>
<br/>
3.  If the hitchhiker you are taking was not stamped into the hostel <br/>
(for example I forgot my stamppad today), do a good deed and stamp it <br/>
into the log.<br/>
