                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-369411732">~I wanted to let everyone know about an incident that happened <br/>
to me this week. I was in Scotland at Spignesi Wildlife Management <br/>
Area. I was attired in my blaze orange as was my dog. I saw a couple <br/>
of hunters (wearing blaze orange as well) across a field, made eye <br/>
contact and proceeded in opposite directions. Later on we came across <br/>
each other (while I was stamping in) at a stone wall. We talked, the <br/>
dogs barked etc. There was no mistaking the fact that we were all <br/>
aware of each other. The hunters moved on and I proceeded 20 steps <br/>
down the same wall to a bonus box. As I was stamping into my log book <br/>
I heard a shot and bark from the tree I was standing next to rained <br/>
down on me! I was furious (and scared). I confronted them out on the <br/>
trail. Their response was-'well, it is hunting season. You shouldn't <br/>
be out in places where hunting is allowed!'<br/>
     I am not in any way against hunting or hunters. I also do not <br/>
want to come off as believing that all hunters are this careless and <br/>
inconsiderate. Carelessness makes me furious though. I realize that <br/>
all of us are out there and I would like everyone to be safe. Please <br/>
everyone have on blaze orange and make some noise-bells, whatever. At <br/>
least as hikers we will be doing all that we can to be safe. If there <br/>
is anything else that we should be doing please post to the list so <br/>
that everyone will be aware of it.<br/>

    Your story is unbelievable!  How incredibly stupid could those hunters have been.  The scary thing is, if these are people who previously saw you and spoke to you, I worry about the hunters that we don't meet along the way.  The other frightening thing is that I believe Spignesi Wildlife Management Area is named for a DEP officer who was accidently shot and killed by a hunter.<br/>
<br/>
Be careful out there this weekend!!<br/>
