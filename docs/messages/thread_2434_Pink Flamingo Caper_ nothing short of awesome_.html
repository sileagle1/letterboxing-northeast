wonderful event it was incredible.<br/>
<br/>
Please add our thanks &amp; gratitude to the many detectives who invited <br/>
us into their homes and businesses on a Saturday.:0)<br/>
<br/>
I would give my vote to the Closeau family and the "too cute for <br/>
words" Pink Panther. When we were stamping up at their home the boys <br/>
entertained us with their rendition of Boston Red Sox baseball :)<br/>
<br/>
I would also add an honorable mention to Lt.Joe Friday who had <br/>
Oceanwytch, Nautilus, Culex &amp; myself chuckling with his impression.<br/>
<br/>
Again thanks to all involved on this amazing event. The bar has <br/>
definitely been set for future gatherings :)<br/>
