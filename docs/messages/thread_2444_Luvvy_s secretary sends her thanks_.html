Thanks to our dear friends, Mark &amp; Sue Pepe and Gingerblue, we made a good team!<br/>
Thanks to all who carved the detective stamps. It was like Christmas every time one came in the mail. I promise to return them ASAP.<br/>
To all who came and contributed in any way, you made it all worthwhile!<br/>
And as for the detectives...well all I can say is that they had a fantastic time meeting all the letterboxers and would do it again in a heartbeat!<br/>
Thanks again everybody,<br/>
Deanne, the lazy letterboxer<br/>
