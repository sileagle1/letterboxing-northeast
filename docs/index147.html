                        On 4/22/04, a friend was searching for boxes in Fisher Meadows in Avon
and may have lost his sunglasses there.  He would appreciate it if I
could be notified should anyone happen to come across them....

Inquiring minds want to know --- when's the Inn opening for the 
tourist season???  We've got a few travellers in our pack just 
itching to stay overnight!

                        Hi all,  I know these boxes are in Canada but they were placed by New
