                        Again, many thanks to those of you keeping ToadDog and us in your 
hearts as we watched him fade away. It was very hard and extremely sad.
It's too good to believe, but we have another wonderful dog!...

                        I took Gizz to the cove today to get the original Red Onion box. Still 
there in fine shape (except for a bit of water but no damage). I'm 
wondering if we can't get it back on the clue list, it's...

                        Recently I met a letterboxer /American Revolution re enactor.

I asked how they were similar.

One is hiking with a purpose, the other is camping with a purpose.

                        Does anyone know whether the Pamet Harbor LB is still there? I have a 
feeling that it may been washed away. When was it last found? Thanks.
