                        It seems in the spring clean up, Battle of Bunker Hill has gone

emailed the placer (I hope it went through).

Happy boxing!

                        Amy, Thomas and I were at the Butterfly Tor box yesterday and found 
a red bandanna.  We're not sure who was the last to stamp in.
   Hope all is enjoying the wonderful weather...
