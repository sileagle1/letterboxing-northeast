                        Just wanted to let you all know I've launched my first hitchhiker. 
Please be on the lookout for this cute little guy and let me know

                        Once again it is almost time for the Haunted House Letterbox!  This is a limited time box, so keep a look out for it!

This is different from last years box so it counts again!
