                        Hello,

                        I just wondered if anyone has heard anything new on the mystery 
gathering.  I checked the archives and didn't find any new posts so I

                        Fly Like an Eagle box has been removed. When/if it returns, it will 
probably be in a new spot, so toss those directions if you've 
printed them.

                        I pulled the Adams Mill box in Manchester today since it was laying out open,
