Anyone who's going to the SVT gathering and wishes to carpool, you can 
come with me.  I'm in the Grafton area.

I'm not on the boards much, so if you're interested its better to...

                        Does anyone know anywhere to buy carving rubber?  We live in Waterford
and the store near us went out of business.  We are willing to travel
a bit, we will use the time to box in that area.

Thank you
