                        Has anyone reported these thefts to the police?  They usually want to

                        It seems they are going for parks that have large numbers of boxes to

                        I just got a post from AQ that the boxes that Astrii found at Gillette Castle on Thursday of last week are now coming up ATTEMPTED, which means this problem is becoming an epidemic.
