                        There were 3 boxes and 3 stamps, one in each, right?  That's three in my book (pun intended). Just because there was no log in the first 2 boxes, I'd count them as FOUND. YYMV

                        It was such a smash at the monster mash!  Special thanks goes out to 
the volunteers and their work.  They were non stop all day...except 
for those Monster games in which they played. 

Also Thank...
