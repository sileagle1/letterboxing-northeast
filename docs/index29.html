                        Does anyone know an Estelle from Portland ME who stamped in the Mexican Bat in Austin TX? 
If so, I've carved a new stamp now and can send  you an impression. It must have been a big 
disappointment...

                        Hi there!

Does anyone have saved (or know how to obtain) the clues for the "old" (Centennial Series) DEP LB's?

Specifically, I am interested in the #10 (Nepaug S.F.) box, in an effort to "re-find"...
